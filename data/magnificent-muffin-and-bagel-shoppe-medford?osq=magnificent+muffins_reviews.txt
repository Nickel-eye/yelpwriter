["Great little breakfast spot! While I only live just down the street, there are 6-7 different restaurants I can choose from, but I always go here.\n\nThe staff is very friendly, food is great, it's inexpensive, and while the line is usually long (which I think is testament to their quality) the service is quick."]
["The quintessential old school breakfast sandwich spot!\n\nRecommendations:\n-bacon egg and cheese on a toasted (well done) English muffin\n-ham egg and cheese on a griddled multigrain bagel\n-sausage egg and cheese on a griddled cinnamon raisin bagel\n-the iced tea (in house made)\n\nThe actual muffins and sweets here look a bit confectionery/artificial, but it's an old school shop doin it just how it presents itself, so no qualms about that \n\nBein born and raised in Harlem NY, baconeggandcheeses were like an everyday thing and all the bodegas (at least 2 per block ) had em for only like $3/4... My goodness I miss them. Boston/Greater Boston doesn't really have stores or deals that make this divine sandwich, EXCEPT Magnificent Muffs.\n\nI don't think they have bulky rolls and they don't have turkey bacon, but their options and skill in the grill is dope."]
["Ok. So the muffins aren't exactly magnificent but the staff is so pleasant that it makes up for it. I just go there for a cheap, fast breakfast and to catch up with friends.  I'll always go back because I think it's important to support local businesses."]
["Went in there on a Sunday morning and there were about 10 employees behind the counter, none of whom were probably older than 16. They were much more interested in talking amongst themselves than dealing with the customers. After we ordered, the staff ended up giving our food to someone else by accident. Food wasn't bad, but the customer service was highly lacking and we most likely won't be back."]
["Love the biggie and muffins here! We live in walking distance so we come here when we can. There's typically a line but it's worth the wait. Muffins are excellent! My favorite flavors are French vanilla, French toast, pistachio and the chocolate chip. A few times we have been there and had no wait so I have also tried a plate of two eggs, toast and bacon. I'm not a coffee drinker but my husband likes the coffee. Only a few tables indoors and a few tables out front. Super friendly staff, definitely our top spot for breakfast."]
['Our first visit after an unsatisfying buffet breakfast at the hotel.  My daughter ordered a bacon, egg white and cheese on a plain bagel.  I left with on of their peach cobbler muffins.  We enjoyed both very much.  The store is small and clearly caters to the morning breakfast take out. I would highly recommend it.']
['"Mag muff" is a favorite of Tufts students and Somerville locals alike. It\'s small and can be jam-packed on a weekend morning, but the service is quick and extremely personable. The staff learn and remember repeat visitors\' names and help everyone to feel right at home. Indoor seating is extremely limited - it\'s geared more for to-go orders - but in the warm weather they put seats outside on the sidewalk and it\'s the perfect way to start the day. \n\nThe muffins and bagels are fresh and the sandwiches are just the perfect amount of greasy. They\'re delicious, but don\'t leave you feeling unhealthy. It\'s a wholesome and fast breakfast and you leave feeling a little more apart of the Somerville/Medford community. It\'s the best place around to ditch a hangover and get your day rolling. And it\'s cheap too!']
["Every time I'm in town, I make an effort to stop by Mag Muff in Teele Square. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious, and well worth the trek. Don't forget to bring cash - they don't accept anything else!"]
['Lovely place for an early Sunday muffin after church. Cheers to the eclectic flavor choices as well as the general old-school family-oriented decor and style of the place. One of those hidden gems/holes in the wall that make you want to explore nooks in a city more in case something amazing is around the corner. A regular there and will be back again, service is nice and the history is palatable! Cheers!']
["This is one of Medford's only destination restaurants, and by that I mean it's a bakery counter that people from one town over might seek out. And well they should.\n\nThe muffins are divine and one of the things that I love about 'em is that the textures vary - the blueberry and chocolate chip are dry and crumbly cake, the sour cream and banana are moist and spongy cake. And they are all, happily, some form of cake. \n\nThe bagels aren't bad - you don't need to toast them if they are fresh - but the cream cheese is overpriced. And the egg sandwiches are disappointing; they are a little on the small side and kinda not so flavorful. Especially if you're used to an egg sandwich from a Brazilian place, for example.\n\nThe place is, as reported, ridiculously homey and the $2 flat rate needs to make a widespread comeback. Hipster coffee shops take note."]
["This place is the definition of a decent local breakfast joint. But they don't take cards. It's 2017, come on!"]
["I am addicted to this place. I am not even a huge fan of muffins, but I find myself coming here every weekend. Their french vanilla muffin is my go-to, but they have about 10 flavors on display each time I'm there. The cinnamon chocolate chip and french toast muffins are also some of my favorites. The staff is extremely friendly, and the line goes very quickly whenever there is one. It is cash only though, as a heads up! I'm not a huge fan of their omelettes, but their breakfast sandwiches are also very good. Bottom line, this place probably has some of the best muffins in the Boston area. Highly recommend!"]

["This place is excellent! I just happened to be across the street getting my car fixed at Mallett Automotive (5 stars), and the guy recommended this place! Boy am I glad he did!\n\nI had a breakfast sandwich - this place is GREAT!!! Wow, I would definitely make the trip up here just for this place. The staff is really friendly and know most of their customers by name and order! And they make delicious breakfast sandwiches straight from breakfast sandwich heaven. Definitely coming back here!\n\nMy singular complaint is that this place is cash only, unfortunately. There are multiple credit card services that they can use now. As people carry less and less cash, credit card machines become more important. But it appears that people who come here are not surprised as they are mostly regulars. Anyway, this is literally my only complaint. Four stars because I think it's a big deal.\n\nGreat place! Don't miss it, but bring cash!"]
['Good local spot for breakfast. But they should ask that employees wear hairnets. A long hair was baked in my muffin.']
["While the muffins and iced coffee were delicious, the five stars are for phenomenal customer service! I didn't realize it was cash only and the woman who helped me was super understanding and rather than watch me count out dimes and quarters she told me I could pay the remaining dollar next time I come in. Believe me, there will be a next time and I will come with cash in hand!"]

["Ok. So the muffins aren't exactly magnificent but the staff is so pleasant that it makes up for it. I just go there for a cheap, fast breakfast and to catch up with friends.  I'll always go back because I think it's important to support local businesses."]
["Went in there on a Sunday morning and there were about 10 employees behind the counter, none of whom were probably older than 16. They were much more interested in talking amongst themselves than dealing with the customers. After we ordered, the staff ended up giving our food to someone else by accident. Food wasn't bad, but the customer service was highly lacking and we most likely won't be back."]
["Love the biggie and muffins here! We live in walking distance so we come here when we can. There's typically a line but it's worth the wait. Muffins are excellent! My favorite flavors are French vanilla, French toast, pistachio and the chocolate chip. A few times we have been there and had no wait so I have also tried a plate of two eggs, toast and bacon. I'm not a coffee drinker but my husband likes the coffee. Only a few tables indoors and a few tables out front. Super friendly staff, definitely our top spot for breakfast."]
['Our first visit after an unsatisfying buffet breakfast at the hotel.  My daughter ordered a bacon, egg white and cheese on a plain bagel.  I left with on of their peach cobbler muffins.  We enjoyed both very much.  The store is small and clearly caters to the morning breakfast take out. I would highly recommend it.']
['"Mag muff" is a favorite of Tufts students and Somerville locals alike. It\'s small and can be jam-packed on a weekend morning, but the service is quick and extremely personable. The staff learn and remember repeat visitors\' names and help everyone to feel right at home. Indoor seating is extremely limited - it\'s geared more for to-go orders - but in the warm weather they put seats outside on the sidewalk and it\'s the perfect way to start the day. \n\nThe muffins and bagels are fresh and the sandwiches are just the perfect amount of greasy. They\'re delicious, but don\'t leave you feeling unhealthy. It\'s a wholesome and fast breakfast and you leave feeling a little more apart of the Somerville/Medford community. It\'s the best place around to ditch a hangover and get your day rolling. And it\'s cheap too!']
["Every time I'm in town, I make an effort to stop by Mag Muff in Teele Square. Their breakfast sandwiches are delicious, and well worth the trek. Don't forget to bring cash - they don't accept anything else!"]
['Lovely place for an early Sunday muffin after church. Cheers to the eclectic flavor choices as well as the general old-school family-oriented decor and style of the place. One of those hidden gems/holes in the wall that make you want to explore nooks in a city more in case something amazing is around the corner. A regular there and will be back again, service is nice and the history is palatable! Cheers!']
["This is one of Medford's only destination restaurants, and by that I mean it's a bakery counter that people from one town over might seek out. And well they should.\n\nThe muffins are divine and one of the things that I love about 'em is that the textures vary - the blueberry and chocolate chip are dry and crumbly cake, the sour cream and banana are moist and spongy cake. And they are all, happily, some form of cake. \n\nThe bagels aren't bad - you don't need to toast them if they are fresh - but the cream cheese is overpriced. And the egg sandwiches are disappointing; they are a little on the small side and kinda not so flavorful. Especially if you're used to an egg sandwich from a Brazilian place, for example.\n\nThe place is, as reported, ridiculously homey and the $2 flat rate needs to make a widespread comeback. Hipster coffee shops take note."]
["This place is the definition of a decent local breakfast joint. But they don't take cards. It's 2017, come on!"]
["I am addicted to this place. I am not even a huge fan of muffins, but I find myself coming here every weekend. Their french vanilla muffin is my go-to, but they have about 10 flavors on display each time I'm there. The cinnamon chocolate chip and french toast muffins are also some of my favorites. The staff is extremely friendly, and the line goes very quickly whenever there is one. It is cash only though, as a heads up! I'm not a huge fan of their omelettes, but their breakfast sandwiches are also very good. Bottom line, this place probably has some of the best muffins in the Boston area. Highly recommend!"]
['I have known Joan for 18 years. This place is great. Delicious muffins! My dad gets his coffee and muffin there every weekend. I love the cranberry orange muffin!']
['I love this place! The food is great, the people are kind. Lovely little local spot to have breakfast on a weekend morning. Feels like home with great neighbors:)']
["Absolute perfection.  As good as everybody says.  Best muffins I've ever had anywhere.  Great egg and cheese.  The lines are long but it moves fast.  Wish it stayed open later.  Worth the trip."]
["Worth it!!! Great muffins, bagels, coffee, etc. I've never had a bad meal here. Recommend the apple cinnamon bagel grilled!"]
["This place is excellent! I just happened to be across the street getting my car fixed at Mallett Automotive (5 stars), and the guy recommended this place! Boy am I glad he did!\n\nI had a breakfast sandwich - this place is GREAT!!! Wow, I would definitely make the trip up here just for this place. The staff is really friendly and know most of their customers by name and order! And they make delicious breakfast sandwiches straight from breakfast sandwich heaven. Definitely coming back here!\n\nMy singular complaint is that this place is cash only, unfortunately. There are multiple credit card services that they can use now. As people carry less and less cash, credit card machines become more important. But it appears that people who come here are not surprised as they are mostly regulars. Anyway, this is literally my only complaint. Four stars because I think it's a big deal.\n\nGreat place! Don't miss it, but bring cash!"]
['Good local spot for breakfast. But they should ask that employees wear hairnets. A long hair was baked in my muffin.']
["While the muffins and iced coffee were delicious, the five stars are for phenomenal customer service! I didn't realize it was cash only and the woman who helped me was super understanding and rather than watch me count out dimes and quarters she told me I could pay the remaining dollar next time I come in. Believe me, there will be a next time and I will come with cash in hand!"]
['Grilled cheese with tomato is my favorite (a must try)  ... .the coffee is so good and fresh ...service is quick and friendly, very nice ladies trying to do the best they can for the customers and a very nice gentleman holding the door for you when you get out , wishing you a magnificent  day ....I just love the place ...']

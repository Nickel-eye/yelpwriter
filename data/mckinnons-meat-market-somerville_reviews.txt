["The best meat at the best prices in the greater Boston area. (PERIOD) \n\nI've been a regular for over 3 years and I can't get enough. Whether you live in Cambridge, Somerville, Boston, Arlington or one of the other suburbs you've probably heard about the awesome meat selection at Mckinnons and even more about the unbelievable prices. A skeptic by nature I didn't believe until I saw it. Wow! I can now say confidently that these guys know what their doing - from brisket, to ribs, to chicken, to fish no one beats their freshness or prices! \n\nBeyond the quality and the prices what really takes Mckinnons to the next level for me is the people.  From management down to the cashiers I've had nothing but pleasant experiences. \n\nPro Tip: Produce + deli selection and prices are just as impressive as the meat section."]
["My father was a loyal customer who would spend close to $100 a week there. Easter weekend they labeled my dads pork for beef and would not give him the difference in price back the week after.  They are not good people to do business with. The owner gave my father a bunch of nonsene. Needless to say my father who gave them business will never go back there. The owner can go shove his pork up his ass. \n\nA year later new ownership took over and reached out to me I gave them another shot and Charlie and Rico took care of us they now how to handle customers. I couldn't have been happier.  They have the best meat with extremely good prices. Needless to say we will be back every weekend!"]
["If you're into prepping meals this place is great. I usually try to stop by once a week to pick something up, maybe grab some chicken breast or bulk buy their extra lean ground beef. Fresh meat, quality selection, great prices."]
["You can't find a better price for the quality of the meat at other places/supermarket!\n\nI am a regular for past five+ years and I get all my meat from McKinnon's. Steak/pork/ribs/chicken, you can also get some bones too to make home-made broth. or order hard to find special cut (such as pint-cut brisket!) and they will have it ready for you!!\n\nCharles the owner is most helpful.  So happy to have this wonderful store in my neighborhood!!"]
["A week ago, following Yelp's recommendation, I explored Mckinnon's and made a small order of ground pork and frozen goat. Both tasted wonderful and the price was really reasonable. I thought I found my go-to meat shop. This Saturday, we bought a couple packages including veal cutlet, ground pork, ribs and pork hocks etc. The veal was great. But the same day when we opened the ground pork and the hocks, they smelled absolutely foul.  The sell-by date was at least Monday. The quality of the meat is good if it's not foul. But with half of the meat is stinky, I will probably not take my chance any more."]
['Picked up some filet mignons today. The meat was tender and moist. My tummy is full and I am a happy customer. Will be returning soon']
['Popped in to buy some short ribs- ended up leaving with chicken breast, steak, and scallops. The prices are crazy good here, and IDK what the clown below is saying- the people here were awesome! Rose is a sweetheart. I think they switched POS but whatever- the prices make it worth it. See you guys soon!']
["Like any red blooded, American dude, I like my meat. I like it grilled, baked, fried, and sauteed. I like it salted, seasoned, sauced, and plain. I like it early, often, and as the foundation of my most flavorful meals. I like it any way except for overpriced, so I want one thing, and one thing only when I hit a local meat market: a large selection of cheap, and high quality meats I can find no where else.\n\nI had already done a price comparison between local supermarkets, and settled on one particular chain as being cheaper than others. I was reasonably satisfied with that. I had heard legends of cheaper meat, but never witnessed it my self. I thought that I was doing OK until a friend referred me to McKinnon's.\n\nI was determined to investigate, and see if the rumors were true. I went one day after work, and could only peer longingly through the glass at a large, and prominent meat case as soon as you enter the store. They close at 700p, and I arrived at 715p, dang. You had better arrive with a purpose after work, folks, because good meat deals wait for no man.\n\nI probably could have saved a trip, if I were the kind of guy to find out about businesses ahead of time. If only there were some central site where people could write, and read reviews of where they shop! Alas! where to find such a place!\n\nArmed with new knowledge that I probably could have read online, I returned a few days later during open hours. My point of comparison was boneless chicken breast: $1.79 versus the $2.50 I was paying. I checked a few other things I commonly buy just to be sure: chicken thighs, $1.39 versus $1.50, and McKinnon's even sells them deboned.\n\nCanned goods, eggs, and produce, are no cheaper at McKinnon's than any other supermarket, but that is not why you are here. You want to meet people who sell meat, and meat accessories, and that is exactly what McKinnon's is. Get your meat fix, and save a few dollars while you are at it."]
["Great place for a wide selection of decently priced meats. They have everything from steaks to beef bones. You won't find any organic, grass-fed stuff here so you get what you pay for. Some of the more obscure things tend to rotate so call ahead if you want something specific. They also carry a small selection of seafood like salmon and clams. The area to the right of the meats has a tiny deli and a meager selection of fruits and vegetables. Overall a good place to stock up on cheap meat."]
["McKinnon's have unbeatable prices for absolutely DELICIOUS meats! I spent close to $100 on JUST meat, chicken and fish &amp; for the amount I got, I would have EASILY spent way more at Stop n Shop or even Market Basket. \n\nMcKinnon's is fresh, flavorful and a great deal! I really don't understand some of the negative reviews on here, but hey - to each his own I guess, right? \n\nI will definitely be buying my meat/chicken/fish here from only here from now on."]
['Excellent neighborhood meat shop and deli.  Good prices and a super convenient location for people living near Davis.  Even if I am shopping at the supermarket for other reasons, I always stop here on the way home to get meat.']
["McKinnon's always hooks it up with some cheap ass (and fresh) chicken!!! $1 - 3 dollars/pound tops with none of that elbowing that goes down in the chicken aisle at Market Basket. \n\nTheir chicken has that fresh looking sheen on it; you know they get new stuff regularly. I know they're pumping antibiotics and chemicals in their animals to get them so fat, but I don't care because it's cheap, and I can't tell the difference between it and Whole Foods expensive ass $6/pound air dried chicken. \n\nShout out to the cashier lady who is always on the phone."]
['Since the new owners/management took over this place has had made a 100% turnaround!! Fresh quality meats, great fresh seafood selection. Produce has improved and the place is spotless! Yay McKinnons!!!']
["I absolutely love McKinnon's. I've had the pleasure of shopping here for many years. Great selection of reasonably priced meats.I don't know how they price some of the meats so low.  Solid deli counter with inexpensive cold cuts. If you're coming here for vegetables this isn't the place for you. The veggie selection is limited. Fair warning this place is ultra packed with people on a Saturday. I think everybody and their brother shops here on the weekends. Who can blame them with great prices like these."]
['This place has a huge selection of meats and cuts (from the usual suspects like chicken, beef, pork to more unusual items like rabbit and goat) all at absolutely incredible prices (like $3.99/lb for rabbit, everywhere else it\'\'s almost $6. \n\nI was like a kid in a candy store, except add 30 years and it\'s all about meat not candy. I purchased some sausages which I plan to try this weekend, and some marinated lamb tips that were GREAT! super tender and delicious.\n\nThey also have a carb section (dry pastas and bread/buns/roills), a deli which I didn\'t try, and a small fruits and veggies section which would do in a pinch, I suppose I tend to stick with the main offering when I go to a new place rather than order "off the menu".\n\nAnyway, they have a butcher in every day of the week, (they leave early on Saturday and Sunday, but I\'m sure if you call before then they can prep what you were looking for), the area is nice and realtively easy to park, and there\'s an online special page so you can s\\check prices before you go.']
['Our turkey is "fowl"..... Thanksgiving meal ruined but hey... we have our health. McKinnon\'s is a great place so I won\'t completely eviscerate them for this. Only the 2nd time I have ever had a bad deal here &amp; that\'s going back 20 years. However there has been a decline in quality over the past few years. Alas McKinnon\'s is the only show in town. The supermarket meat sections are laughable and Dom\'s is overpriced for a simple tip recipe. \n\n** Update: As of only a few weeks ago McKinnon\'s is under new ownership. I received a message &amp; an offer of full reimbursement for the inconvenience. I was the only one to complain which isn\'t unusual. Looks like new owners are revamping &amp; I look forward to getting back there soon.']
['Do you like apples? I said do you like apples? Well you will be out of luck here. This is where you go for a great priced meat coma. Great staff with helpful information on which cut of meat you want depending on your needs. Always fresh and great prices. \n\nThree chicken, three pork and three beef for under $27. Score! My freezer is now full.']
["Great prices, awesome selection. They carry goat and rabbit, smoked hocks, feet, marrow bones, and other overlooked cuts I love but have a hard time finding. There's also a small produce section so you can get all the ingredients you need for your recipe, although the produce is neither as well-priced nor as fresh as the meat. My favorite thing about McKinnon's, though, is their store-made lamb stew - bony bits simmered to fall-apart tenderness in a veggie-packed tomato sauce, redolent of garlic and grandmotherly love. It's just $4 for a generous portion and I would eat it every day if they made it more often than a few times a month."]
["i just bought some filet mignon, huge potatoes, chicken drumsticks, organic herb mix, a ton of brussel sprouts, a dozen eggs, and a nice hunk of cheese for 35 bucks. this would have easily been twice the price at star market down the road. i'm sure even better deals could be found at mckinnons. they dont have everything a supermarket would have, but it was really nice to cobble together a beautifully cooked mid rare steak, potatoes, and brussel sprouts. everything tasted fresh. can't wait to cook up the chicken!\n\ni absolutely love the old school nature of this place as well."]
['Nothing makes the BBQ season like a great butcher. You have so many options when you come here. Marinated, plain, steak, chicken, beef, burgers, hot dogs, bacon, chicken thighs, ham, a deli with cold cut meats and cheeses, seafood, and fresh veggies and some fruit? YES! \n My husband and I come here to their family sized pack of chicken, their chicken cutlets, pork roasts and so much more. We love seeing a small business within a short walk of us, with great quality meats. \n We have ha d man past BBQ thanks to them. Their meat quality is wonderful, and we always find something new and delicious here. Their stuffed pork roasts are great (apple and raisin stuffeing,yum) and always make an amazing dinner.']
["I was recently in this store on December 6th I bought two steaks and roasts in a bunch of Deli stuff the next day the meat was bad the deli items the starting to get slimy the store has been going downhill for the last 3 months don't know what you got a new distributor or not you used to have the best deli in town but now it's gone to pot I won't be back can't recommend this to anybody"]
['Awesome small market in the middle of Davis Square. Huge meat selection. Awesome delicious selction of premarinated meats all with a great price. The cajun mairnated chicken breast was delicious! \n\nA small selection of vegetables and fruits. Nothing huge but everything you would need for a quick pick up or everyday grocery shopping. Super friendly staff ! Love it!']
['Cannot beat they quality or prices here! I have been coming here for years and will continue to only purchase my meat/chicken here. I never purchase at a grocery store.']
["McKinnon's is always worth the trek to Davis.  Awesome meat selection, great prices.  There's a small produce section at this one too, if you want to pick up some veggies to grill.  We really love the ribs and steaks from here, but honestly, I don't think we've ever had anything bad!"]
["I know a lot of people like it for the meat but I was really dissatisfied today. I bought a package of mixed greens and when I opened it at home, found it was slimy and had gone bad. The produce at mckinnons is usually not much better. It also smells of fish as soon as you walk in and the cashier's are not often friendly."]
['Inexpensive place to buy meat for the poor and working class... yes, the unprocessed fresh chicken will taste and mouth-feel "gamey" compared to the Purdue stuff you are used to, but this place is a fantastic store to shop for meat and deli. Chicken is the cheap meat that is easy to afford.\n\nAbout bad reviews: sorry but, reality check: meat is gross, people. Period. If it isn\'t gross it is full of salt, sodium nitrate, sodium nitrite, sugar, industrial chemicals, hormones, processed, etc. Please understand that creates a bias, and know that all meat places used to be like McKinnon\'s years ago... the Star Market in Porter Square and Savenor\'s Market used to be exactly like McKinnon\'s, and everyone shopped there and did just fine.']
["I love my dad.\n\nYeah, that's loved in the past tense. But I still love him, cause his memory will live on with me for a long time. I got every bit of my goofball persona from him. I even threatened to crack one of his dirty jokes at the luncheon after his funeral, but I figured the joke police in the sky were watching scornfully.\n\nDad was way more successful than I'll ever be. From the depression ravaged streets of industrial Indiana, he rose to be an airborne WW2 hero, a football champ, a loving husband and father of three, a not too shabby bowler, a terrible but avid golfer, and a hard working insurance adjuster who would go on to wear the corporate crown in Big Chi-Cah-Go.\n\nAnd he made a mean steak.\n\nEvery Saturday nite was steak in our household, cause you could do that then without committing high financial crimes on Wall Street. Tenderized with Kitchen Bouquet, seared to perfection on the Sears gas grill in the back yard, and served with baked potatoes, fresh corn on the cob, sauteed mushrooms, and English muffins for dipping in the steak juice.\n\nSo when I want that steak - that Mr. C Steak that Dad use to carve off bits of for the dog before slapping it on the grill - I head to McKinnon's Meat Market in Davis Square. A butcher shop from the days when men were men, and beef was what's for dinner.  If it moos, clucks, oinks, gobbles, or whatever, they've got it here, fresh and cheap. Delmonicos, rib eyes, Porterhouses, steak tips, they've got 'em all, red and marbley, and ready to go for under $10/lb.  And chicken tenders at $1.99/lb or boneless center cut pork chops at $2.99 make for a cheap and tasty stovetop concoction with your favorite marinade.\n\nVeggies and stuff - ehh, if you need 'em, they've got 'em, but that's what farmers markets are for.\n\nOkay, there's those allegations in the news about bleaching the chicken. Yah. I don't smell any bleach. And I know what bleach smells like. It smells like the pool at Hell High School, Indiana, with Bernie Whip Krackenstein the evil gym overlord conducting first period cryogenic chemical experiments on pimply teenage boys.\n\n(No, I did not inherit my Dad's love for sports)\n\nSo put on your parking spot vulching goggles, head to Davis and check out McKinnon's the next time you want to get in touch with your inner carnivore. I did this afternoon, and those steaks brought back memories from days I keep forgetting to remember. Here's to you, Dad. I looseneth my belt and belcheth in your honor."]
["Why is McKinnon's so cheap..? I just can't figure it out, and my best guess is that the meat is about to go bad or something. (That's purely speculation, though! Only my guess.) The place kind of grosses me out, but I used to go with my neighbor who didn't know how to marinate meat and he was happy with the chicken which he purchased regularly. I once made the mistake of grabbing a bag of grapes. When I got home, they were all slimy!"]
["I had completely forgotten about McKinnon's in my time away. I love this place. I love the people who work there. Unless it's changed in the the last few years, this place is old school, real people, affordable meat and poultry all squished in a tiny market in the middle of Davis Square. \n\nA decent enough variety of produce at good prices - check! Cold cuts and prepared foods,yup. Some salads are better than others - but everyone knows chicken salad is a completely subjective salad! I like their marinated meat as well and sometimes they would have some amazing deal on some odd meat or food that you totally didn't expect!\n\nTwo odd things - I seem to remember a smell in the market that always bothered me (cleaning supplies mixed with animal blood? who knows...) and it seemed like a lot of strange people would shop there, sometimes odd or rude but whatever - all part of the McKinnons experience!"]
["This is a fantastic place to get meat. I tried to cook last summer, and I usually hate cooking. Naturally McKinnon's didn't make cooking any more fun, because the meat cooks like any other meat (as expected).\n\nAdvantages of McKinnon's:\n1. It's close to my house (I guess that's only an advantage to me and Davis Square people).\n\n2. It's cheap, especially for marinated meats - you can get them here at prices that rival those at supermarkets for regular meat.\n\n3. Variety, again especially in the marinates that they provide.\n\n4. Good for research purposes. My friend and I needed some sausage casing to serve as a model for a certain type of human membrane, and the McKinnon's people gave us 3 feet for only $1! If you're looking for animal parts for various medical projects, McKinnon's should be your go-to store.\n\n\nDisadvantages of McKinnon's:\nThe selection of vegetables and other things are limited. But McKinnon's is primarily a butcher shop, so it seems silly to see that as a negative. Rather, it's pretty amazing that they also have some other stuff in case you forgot to get it at Shaw's."]
["McKinnon's is a prime (haha, prime) example of a place that is hidden in plain sight unless you know exactly what it is. I have passed this place countless times at night assuming that it was just a bodega, but then the Best of Boston was showing it as a top contender for best butcher, and I thought it was time to check it out. \n\nOne of my cookbooks taught me that when you give meat a sniff, it should have a subtle sweetness to it and that's the quality that sets this meat apart. That said, I absolutely adore the butchers at Market Basket, but I have never found that nectarous scent when I give their top round a whiff. I was however, a bit disappointed in a fillet mignon here that I found browning on the bottom when I got home, 4 days before it's sell-by. It didn't affect the taste at all, and I probably shouldn't be too picky given that I paid less than $5 for it, but all the same worth mentioning. \n\nGreat variety and value, and while I'm not sure I'd trek here if I didn't work in the area, I can still appreciate it for what it is."]
["I found this place on a random Sunday after brunch at The Painted Burro and I'm so glad I did! What a wonderful variety of meat! Everything is reasonably priced and well organized. We just got chicken breasts (at a fine price of $1.99/lb) and some sweet Italian sausages. For the more adventurous they have Goat meat, Ox Tails and several things I haven't even heard of. I definitely plan on stocking up next time I'm in the area."]
['Butchers with white coats stocking the shelves while still covered in lamb\'s blood?  Awesome!  \n\nPretend for a moment the year is once again 1950 and you\'re whisked away to your local butcher, whom you know by first name and he remembers who you are as well.  You both greet each other warmly, discussing the slow April start of the Redsox while he lets you in on a little "secret" that some filets have just arrived and they are at a door buster price of just $2 per lb.\n\nAlright, that\'s pretty much McKinnon\'s in a nutshell.....even if the filet mignon is NEVER $2 a lb anymore. :)  But I did just pay $10 for two decently sized steaks for dinner, the larger grocery store chains could never compete with this.\n\nIt\'s small and cramped and I\'ve noticed myself get flustered at other customers who don\'t notice you are near them and all you want to do is walk around to check out another section of muscle.  It\'s all sorted nicely for you, as you walk down the left hand side you\'re met with lamb cutlets and then on to the incredible cow section.  As you turn to the right you\'ll see every part of the chicken you\'ve ever wanted but were secretly afraid to ask for and then the final part of your journey leads you to the pork products.  Wait, what is that?  Seafood in the middle too??  Yep, McKinnon\'s has it ALL and more....\n\nSo you\'ve filled the basket in your hands to the brim with every animal on Noah\'s Ark and now you\'ve wandered to the "other side" of the store.  Great, now I\'ve got to load up on super cheap veggies.  "Another basket please!" as you call out to your significant other who can\'t keep up the ghastly pace when it comes to the food hoarding you\'ve grown accustomed to here.  Geesh, and deli products now too?  Garlic cheese, seriously??  Where do they come up with this stuff?\n\nStop N Get Robbed doesn\'t deserve my hard earned cash, the murderous McKinnon\'s butchers in the back do......and they deserve yours as well so forget the big chains when it comes to your homemade proteins and only focus on ONE location, this bad boy.']
['Love this store the meat is fantastic I go down about once a month &amp; stock my freezer cheap!!']
['A small neighborhood meat market... They have pretty cool stuff like prepared food, frozen rationed food to just be heated up already seasoned. Good customer service. They had vegetables and fruit there as well.']
['The produce is usually mediocre. \n\nPrices are decent. \n\nTried both the sausage and ground hamburg, both tasted exactly the same. Like a dry old shoe. Never buying meat here again. \n\n\nTwo stars being a non chain local store.']
["I had a wonderful experience here, while I would suggest calling to be sure that they are open if you plan to go in the afternoon, the place is worth finding parking in Davis Sq. for.  I needed ground veal, pork and beef for meatballs, the didn't sell the small size that I wanted so the butcher offered to mix them all together for me and freeze half.  The meat was great, the prices are amazing and I am sad that I am moving a little further away and it will be difficult for me to get here.  It is a small store, but its a meat market so I wouldn't expect it to be a grocery store full of produce or other materials.  \n\nPlace is a hidden gem!"]
["McKinnion's is one of those old fashion markets with the poster with the deals on the windows and deep discount leaders. The meat is fairly fresh as the products do move fairly fast and it is a small store. If you are looking for angus or grass fed/pasture raised this is NOT you place, but the place to feed your family. Just be careful parking can be tricky and costly.\n This McKinnion's is not connected with the other stores with the same name."]
["What can be said about McKinnon's that hasn't already been expressed? I stumbled upon this little secret right after I moved to Somerville. Like a good friend, I've introduced my roommates to the joys of McKinnon's as well. We often stop by after work to pick up some meat, especially in the summer when we BBQ. \n\nThe prices are insanely low. Enough, that I too, was worried. However, I've never had a problem. I also don't keep anything longer than a day or two without cooking it. The other wonderful thing about delightfully low prices, when my roommates and I throw a party we do it in style with steaks and burgers and all kinds of delectable pork products that never fails to impress our friends. \n\nThe staff is great, friendly and unobtrusive. I tend to be running in either just as soon as they open or right as they close so I've never had a problem with crowds or long lines."]
["Giving 1 star because I can't give less. 2nd time I've purchased chicken there, brought it home and it smells like rotten feet. I should have known better buying chicken cutlets for $1.99/lb. What good is a great price if you can't freakin eat it?!?\nI can guarantee if the Somerville Board of Health went in there they'd be closed for at least a week to kill all bacteria and diseases. I'm done here, never setting foot in there again......"]
['It\'s got meat, some produce, and a few pre-fab things to offer (bread and cookies and such).  Prices are pretty good but have gone up over the last few years.  It\'s small.  Only street parking avail.  \n\nI don\'t understand all the rave reviews on here for it - I bought some meat products that had NO DATE stamp on them and they were clearly off - smelled foul and old.  I didn\'t pay much for them so I just threw them out.  Still, if you\'re selling meat, you need to have a date stamp.  I should have noticed it was missing when I bought it but I didn\'t.  \n\nI\'ve been back a few times and had poor meat on more than one occasion.  For your typical chicken, steak, what have you I think you\'ll be ok...anything more ummm "adventurous" - proceed at your own risk.']
["Best prices on meat in the area that I've seen in my time here. A few times I've requested cuts of beef brisket for slow cooking in BBQ sauce, and it always turns out great."]
["Fantastic place to pick up hot chicks . . . oh wait, it's the other kind of meat market?\n\nMcKinnon's is small, grungy, and cramped, but I love anyplace where I can walk out with 2 filet mignons, a package of pork ribs, approximately 6 lbs. of chicken thighs, and one whole chicken for twenty large. The prices are crazy low yet the meat is really good quality and fresh. It's good enough that I toted a big bag o' raw meat on the T back to Back Bay, and not for the first time. (Side note: sorry about the big bag o' raw meat, fellow T passengers!)"]
["If you want cheap meats... in particular chicken and deli meat, this is the best place to go.\n\nI come here for all poultry needs and the quality is pretty great.\n\nOn top of the good prices, is the sales they have from time to time so it's definitely a permanent go to spot when food shopping."]

["It's soup season!\n\nA kind and conversational elder who lives extremely close to McKinnon's brings in vats of homemade soup, stews and chowders for sale at the deli counter. There's no menu, rhyme or reason to his varieties - he just makes whatever he wants and sells it to the freezing grateful for practically nothing.\n\nToday, I got hefty pint of whitefish chowder for $1.50, frozen bone-in goat for curry and... holy shit. I just re-read my original review and realized that after almost FOUR YEARS, the prices for everything have remained unchanged. The only thing that's different is the recent addition of a pre-made foods hot and cold box. Plus, the same guy is whipping those soups up, which means they definitely have anti-aging effects.\n\nMcKinnon's is a time warp, a roadside Mystery Spot that defies definition and creates its own gravity. It encourages exploration with outrageously gratifying results. Not sure about those neon purple Chinese style sausages? Eh, what the hell, they're only $2.\n\nFlash forward to you sitting down in the corner of your kitchen, double fisting half-eaten hot dog buns with mustard smeared lips and a purple meat grin stretched from ear to ear."]
['Sometimes there\'s livers. Sometimes there\'s not. Sometimes there\'s cornish game hens. Sometimes there\'s not. Sometimes there\'s frozen octopus. Sometimes there\'s not. Sometime\'s there\'s chickens\' feet. Sometime\'s there\'s not. You never know what there\'s going to be, but the weirdo stuff that you can get regular without much hassle down at Market Basket occasionally pops up at McKinnon\'s. It\'s always a surprise, not something you can plan your meal around. Maybe you\'ll walk in, see a precious little calf\'s liver, and be inspired to change your dinner menu - but if you know in advance that you\'ll need that wee calf\'s protein synthesizer tonight, McKinnon\'s might not have it and Market Basket is a better bet. Enjoy the parking lot, sucka!\n\nAlso - the fish selection is totally unpredictable and the frozen stuff is, well, it\'s frozen, so don\'t expect much. \n\nBut McKinnon\'s is great for the staples: beef and chicken and pork (most pork products, anyway...sometimes they wouldn\'t have a proper butt or shoulder). Always a little lamb, too: ground lamb and lamb chops. The stuff people want.\n\nThe availability of different cuts of steak can be a little erratic, but again, they usually had the stuff people want...just maybe not what YOU want on a particular day. \n\nBut McKinnon\'s is all about the bizarrely low prices. The prices at McKinnon\'s always kinda freaked me out (I don\'t live around here anymore; McKinnon\'s is in the top ten list of things we miss). It\'s not simply that their prices are lower than every other grocer in the area. It\'s that they are SO much lower, it\'s creepy. At first it was "this place might have connections to the mob" creepy. Then it was like "this might be really old unsafe meat" creepy.* Then it was like "this might be a Dr. Who episode where there\'s a twelve-foot spider from another planet just behind the back doors and it\'s using cheap meat to lull us into a cocoon-like state in order to subdue and destroy the human race, and it might actually kill a few of us before the Doctor gets here so let\'s not stand too close to the back doors, but darnit that\'s where the ground beef is and also sometimes calf\'s liver" creepy. \n\nBut the reality is probably something much more mundane and yet somehow more terrifying, not in a "this is creepy" way but in a Lovecraftian cosmic staring-into-the-abyss-as-it-stares-back-at-you kind of way: McKinnon\'s might have long ago paid off its David Square mortgage, probably back in the days of Slummerville, and now it operates on pure profit (after taxes). That doesn\'t explain the price of meat to my satisfaction, but there it is.\n\n*I mention the quality of the meat: we shopped at McKinnon\'s for almost eight years and never ever purchased a bad (I mean "make you sick" bad, not "this is not the finest cut of meat I\'ve ever purchased" bad) cut of meat. I never purchased a truly mind-blowing cut of meat there, either, but at these prices who\'s complaining? Advice: their beef, particularly the ground beef but also the various cuts of steak, tends to go south after a couple days (it doesn\'t go rotten or dangerous, it just dramatically loses its aura of freshness), so buy-and-burn or buy-and-freeze. Don\'t leave it in the fridge of six days. It won\'t taste good.']
['Coming from California, we have local fresh meat at a good price. Living in Boston that is hard to find. Most local meat is really expensive and only available in short amounts. \n\nMcKinnion\'s acquires most of their meats from the midwest. Those huge slaughter houses that are found in places like Nebraska and Iowa. The same places that super markets and restaurants like Fridays get their meats.  If you want the same meat that you can get most other places at a huge discount then come here. \n\nExample: Steak Tips are usually $6.99/lb. Much cheaper then grocery stores.  \n\nAlso, they will cut you steaks and other meat. I asked for 2" pork chops and within 5-minutes they were ready.\n\nFriendly staff, small town feel and conventional meat at a low price.']
['This is the ONLY place to shop for meats of any kind. Jimmy &amp; Clemente run the very best business in Somerville. Always fresh, and at prices you will not beat anywhere. Need a special cut? No problem, it will be prepared exactly as you ask. We will not buy meats anywhere else.']
["I'm in love. In omnivore lovey love. I need to explore more, this is true. But I find myself in everyday conversations trying to bring up McKinnons Meat Market, just to say their name. I wish I was joking But in really not.\n\nI bought 6 lbs of lean ground beef and 3 lbs of chicken breast for about 20$ flat. Amazing. A chuck roast and 2.5lb of chicken tenderloins for 20. Amazing. Like I can't even express. I will walk from porter shaws just come here now. \n\nI've been lucky because I've gone at off times and have yet to experience a really long wait or line. They even have a small produce section in case I forgot to pick up potatoes or lettuce for my meal. I have yet to go to the butcher counter and stuff but I'm excited to go. I just can't contain myself about how much I like them so I had to write this now without further investigating."]
['Seems like a decent spot to get a variety of meat at a reasonable price.\nIdeally for getting bulk food for a BBQ or get together']
["I've been coming here for years, it is probably the biggest reason you should be going to Davis Square. They sell a wide variety of meats at amazing prices. They also a deli and small area for fruits and veggies and some seafood. The deals on some great meat here are just unreal."]
["It was not until I went to a BBQ at a friend's house and found out that the meat and sausages were from McKinnon's that I decided to check it out. Up until that point, I used to get my meat at WholeFoods and although I knew about McKinnon's, the exterior was enough to discourage me from entering and checking it out. Sadly, I was mistaken and should have given it a chance. \n\nRecently, I decided to make some veal schnitzel and after seeing the prices of the veal at WholeFoods, I calculated that the amount I needed was going to cost me $35+ there. Instead, I went to McKinnon's and got the same quantity for just under $10. And the veal was great. \n\nAlthough the place is modest in terms of decor, the place packs quite a bit of meat. It's pretty much any meat lover's wet dream to enter this place and walk around. They are very well organized and the meats are separated and sorted by type: pork, beef, chicken. They seemed to have all kinds of things but I was on a mission and just needed veal. I didn't really have a quick glance but will be returning in future to see what else they have to offer.\n\nSo this old school place is great, conveniently located, there's easy street parking, the service is quick, the prices are incredible and the meat is fresh. I have nothing negative to say about this place and will be returning as a customer."]
["They offer great variety of cuts, but please be aware that they sell LOW quality meat here.  Wouldn't recommend getting cuts from here if you plan on hosting a yummy fancy dinner for your family and friends. I recommend going to Savenor's or MF Dulock if you want some quality meat."]
['I\'ve shopped here for 13 years, the only place I will buy my meat. Had a problem once and Clemente, one of the owners and Meat Manager, said just take what you want, told the cashier Rose the amount and off I went, no fuss.\n\nThe prices can\'t be beat, the marinated steak tips are tops!  Cornish hens are super reasonably priced.  You never know what you will find, every now and then they have random items at super low prices.  A few summers ago, they had five boxes of soft shell crabs, 10 in a box.  I grabbed all five immediately, almost knocking over people in the process, fearing they would take them before I got my hands on them.  I paid about $40 for them and they were delicious, if you\'re a soft shell crab lover, you know what a steal this was.  Purdue chicken tenders at $1.99/lb, at Star Market the same exact package was $4.99/lb.  Firemen, who love to cook, are in here all the time.  Clemente is very accommadating, he\'ll come out to speak with you if you want something special. \n\nBefore I found McKinnons, I shopped at a Cambridge Star Market for a long time and the Meat Manager always said hello to my daughter and I.  I told him one day that I wasn\'t buying meat any longer at Star because I found McKinnons.  He said to me "Thats alright, thats where I buy my meat too!".  Too, too funny!\n\nStore is very clean and staff is super nice.  Very, very sad part when I go to McKinnons now is that Eric and Bobby have both passed, two great guys that really made shopping here a pleasure.  I\'ve missed my buses home because I was always shootin the breaze with them.   Shopping here regularly, you get to know some of the staff well, it will never be the same without them.  Gone too soon.........']
["I LOVE MCKINNONS.\n\nIt's cheap, it's good, it's just lovely.  Yes, you should probably eat the meat pretty quick (I doubt it'd last more than a week in the fridge) but it's great.  And really, it's so cheap.  I usually don't like pulling money into my quality reviews, but with this place you just can't not.\n\nThey have a great selection, really yummy sausages for super cheap, and are really nice.  They also have a small produce section so you can accompany your carnivorous meal with some greenery (appreciated!)"]
['My Dearest McKinnon\'s,\n\nEver since we met I cannot get you out of my head. Some nights I wake up in a cold sweat and reach over for you but you are not there. I catch myself daydreaming about you, and I think others are starting to notice too. Maybe its because everytime I think about you, MMM, I catch myself saying "mmm" aloud. I\'ve tried seeing other meat markets, but they just remind me that they are not you. Sure, I can get fillet mignon almost anywhere, but not for $7.99 a pound. Sure, I can get steak tips at Stop &amp; Shop, but you have so many varieties of pre-marinated meats that it makes my heart stop. My doctor claims that is due to my arteries hardening from eating your delicious bounty 3 meals a day, but what does he know? If this is what true love feels like, then I don\'t want it to stop. Even if my heart stops. \n\nMy friends always tell me about your flaws but they just don\'t know you like I do. They say you have surly employees and other nonsense, and while maybe they are right, I can look past it. You see, McKinnon\'s, you are the perfect meat market for me. I\'m a one meat market kind of guy. I just wish you were a one customer kind of meat market. \n\nYour True Love,\n-Jason J.']
['This place is like entering a time warp. It\'s an old fashion meat market and butcher. I love it, it feels like a family joint, and exactly what I want "going to the market" to entail. Best selection of meat around, plus they have great specials that change frequently. it\'s also super easy to convince my boyfriend to stop in and pick up meat for dinner, because it\'s just that kind of a place. when I move out of Davis I will still be making trips to McKinnons! The employees are great and knowledgable and all together just really pleasant. You won\'t regret a trip here.']
['""The next time I have meat and mashed potatoes, I think I\'ll put a very large blob of potatoes on my plate with just a little piece of meat. And if someone asks me why I didn\'t get more meat, I\'ll just say, "Oh, you mean this?" and pull out a big piece of meat from inside the blob of potatoes, where I\'ve hidden it. Good magic trick, huh?"\n\n-Jack Handy\n\nJack Handy would have LOVED McKinnon\'s. I promise you that. I honestly don\'t know how you can\'t love this place, well if you are vegetarian I guess I could see that ha ha This place is a money saving heaven for anyone that eats any sort of meat---boneless, skinless chicked breasts for $1.50 a pound?? 2 pounds of peeled and cleaned shrimp for $10? scallops for $5 a pound? two huge steaks for $6? \n\nSeems too good to be true, right?? Well it isn\'t. It is true, and they even take credit card! They sell out of their ground turkey which sells for $1 a pound, so no wonder why, but I have gone here twice recently and was sad to find no ground turkey anywhere....They also have a deli section with freshly sliced meats and cheeses and pasta salads and such. Their produce section is not the greatest, so stick to whole foods or TJ\'s for that, but for meat, there is no other place to go! Don\'t let the cheap and low prices fool you! I even bought steak here for my dad and he was amazed by the quality!!\n\nGO MEAT!']
['I almost exclusively grocery shop at McKinnon\'s. Recently I went into Whole Foods and all I could think of is how grateful I am that I have such an awesome meat and produce place in Davis that is a fraction of the price of Whole Foods. The variety of meats makes me want to cook (especially for my man-friends) all the time. It\'s hard to find a small mom and pop store that doesn\'t market their store as a "speciality goods" place and jack up their prices-especially in rapidly gentrifing communities. McKinnon\'s is a true gem in Davis.']
["I love meat. I love markets. I love meat markets.\n\nThis place is awesome. Totally authentic. I am a big fan of picking up filet mignon at this spot for a cool $7.99 a pound. \n\nI've really only tried the steak and the chicken here and I have never been disappointed. \n\nThey have a pretty clutch little produce section that is significantly cheaper than the Shaw's down the street.\n\nThe last reason I love this place is the super mean lady that works the cash register. I love her, but don't tell her. She might kill me."]
['Wicked cheap, huge selection of cuts. real deal butcher chop. Deli counter and produce section. They will have what you want. Thats about it.']
["Great little butcher shop in Davis Sq. They have excellent quality meat. The price is right. The service is great. \n\nIt gets pretty packed so know what you want going in, if possible.  If you don't know what you want, one of the many knowledgable butchers can help you."]
["Meatalicious?  Meaterrific?  I wanna laaaay you down in a bed of meat?  Meatify any positive word or phrase and you will sum up McKinnon's.\n\nEversave actually achieved the store owner's goal.  I bought a $10 for $20 deal, went to a store that I wouldn't have otherwise, and will go back again.   I just bought ground turkey meat for $1.79.  1.25 pounds for $1.79.\n\nHow does this place make a profit?\n\nChicken tenders are 1.69/lb.  A six pack of turkey sausages are $1.49.  Bone in chicken is $0.99/lb or less.  And fillet minion is $7.99/lb (grilled them up wonderfully).  They have a deli with cheap lunch meat and hunks of fun cheeses.  Produce is average, but I didn't look too long since I was distracted by all the hunks-a-meat.\n\nWorkers are friendly, and the lines are long.  Great mom and pop feel to it.\n\nI will no longer buy my meat anywhere else.  And I cannot understand why anyone else who knows of McKinnon's existence would either- unless you want free range/grass fed options, which McKinnon's is lacking."]
["The store stinks and do not trust the sell buy date if there is one on there. Cheap, but  disappointing meat and not fresh. Fish is not cheap, but disappointing. \nThe store is filthy dirty and smells like a Turkish wrestlers jock strap. \nThe vegetables and fruit have all seen better days and they are more expensive than Shaws about 3/4 mile on down the road. I trust Shaw's quality control way more than McKinnon's. \nPlus I value my health................."]
["I think the following will speak to the 5 star rating:\n\n-Enough boneless, skinless, white meat chicken tenders to last me a week\n-Small head of cauliflower\n-two sweet potatoes\n-box of arugala\n-a dozen jumbo eggs\n\nTotal - $11.00  \n\nOk, ok.  I know I'm cheap.\n\nMcKinnon's, can you please tell Shaw's your secret?"]
["The best!  From bacon and steak to marinated pork roasts and house-made sausage, this is the place for good, affordable meat.  The deli isn't as extensive as some, but it's all good, and there's a reasonable selection of cheese now too, as well as a perfectly adequate selection of vegetables.  Bulk chicken hearts, frozen goat meat or octopus (yes, seafood too), a rudimentary array of breads, and plenty of local and national-brand sauces and condiments.\n\nDon't look here for organo-groovy locally or sustainably raised meats, and be patient with the restaurateur in front of you in line.  You'll be singing the praises of McKinnon's when you're serving up your meaty masterpiece!\n\nThat said, it's in Davis Square, so parking is catch-as-catch-can.  Take the Red Line or the bus if you can."]
["Caveat emptor peeps: \nI like to give my business to independent business whenever I can.\n ................ but .................. come ON . I imagine a place like this in Appalachia. \n\nthis place is .......... filthy.  Red flag. I am going to put the stuff from here in my mouth and eat it. \nCheck out the first impression picture at the entrance I just posted. The shopping baskets I think used to be cobalt blue - I couldn't tell through the dirt.\n \nThe produce was hit or miss: some was wrapped in plastic with a beautiful specimen of fuzzy mold growing. Nothing was date stamped. \n\nThe asparagus $3.99/lb and cilantro I got = very good. \n\nI bought MahiMahi that looked fine, but when I got it home and opened it was way  beyond bad . This is how I imagine a rotting dead body to smell . I had to return (to a very apologetic and nce guy) the next day.  It was wrapped in plastic, so most likely it was the way it was packaged and not the quality of the fish - i dont know\n\nThe other reviews love the red meat which seems to be the thing to get here. I'm not a red meat fan so I have no reason to go back. \nI just like to shop someplace that looks clean and sanitary.  AM I ASKING TOO MUCH? I just couldn't wonder what's the back like?  eeeeeeew."]
["This place is truly a meat mecca for Somerville. If you want meats, go here. Not only do you get a premium selection, but you get it at a modest price. I mean... butcher shops are notorious expensive because it's a luxury in some ways... but these guys don't mess around. \n\nApart from the meats, they have a deli and a produce section. Eggs by the dozen are a $1.50! That's cheap. They have olive oils and vinegars and sauces and breads and spices and cheeses. This is a one-stop kind of place.\n\nOne thing that people may or may not realize is they sell San Marzano plum tomatoes, and cheap. Like, a big can of whole peeled San Marzano's for $1.50! You know how much that goes for everywhere else? ($4+)... If I lived in the North End, I would make a special trip out to Davis just to buy these. They are the best plum tomatoes, hands down.\n\nWhile the shop is run by a friendly family, they have a hodgepodge crew working their. You have to be patient with the lines, because everyone knows how great this place is. Go here when you want to plan a fancy BBQ, and drop the name McKinnon's to your friends, and they'll know you went to the right place."]
['Great deals on meats, plus a very good selection of other groceries.\nI just tried their frozen pancakes- yummy!']
["I love McKinnon with all my heart. Nothing compares on a $/quality level. I've looked all over Boston area for inexpensive, quality meats (Meat Land, Super 88, Market Basket, Johnnies Foodmaster), but they all pale in comparison to this gem. I only wish I didn't have to go so far to get to McKinnons. Look for special items in the freezer section. I found marinated chicken quarters at $0.88/lb. \n\nIf you're lucky enough, you might be able to get a whole roasted chicken for $3. A complete steal, and it's good quality too. It made my lunch everyday for a full week."]
['Marinated "classic" sirloin tips. \n\nAround $6/lb\n\nTake these to your next cookout and get a few new best friends or eat them all yourself.\n\nI won\'t tell anyone.']
["Convenient place to buy any type of meat, and I think prices are very reasonable. I mostly buy chicken cuts here. It's much cheaper than other grocery stores nearby and I think the quality is pretty good. At the entrance, there is a sign that says that the store also has a nice selection of cheeses, but I was not impressed with the cheese. Doesn't matter though, I only come here for the meat."]
['I couldn\'t survive without McKinnon\'s.  Literally.  Why? A) excellent prices,  best prices in town, B) excellent quality.  Everything is fresh because it sells so fast.  C) excellent variety, D) excellent deli, E) personalized attention from intelligent staff, F) they have specialty "ethnic" meat such as goat, lamb, gray corned beef for St. Patrick\'s Day, G) best price on eggs, H) small but good produce department...  These are some of the ABC\'s of McKinnon\'s.  I live in Watertown and don\'t have a car.  I make a monthly commute on the T to McKinnon\'s to stock up on meat and a few other things and schlep about 15 - 20 pounds of it home.  Need I say more?  Yes, I do. Small and local is truly beautiful!']
['It could be great...\n\nI went to this place after seeing the good Yelp reviews.  I am trying to shop locally and improve my eating habits in general.  Perhaps this is silly of me, but I expected a local business near Davis Square to carry at least some grass-fed and free-range options for meat.  Instead, they have nothing, zero, zip.\n\nOn the plus side, the prices and selection is very good.  Unfortunately, I am not going to be back until they begin carrying some earth-friendly options.']
['Walk slow or you\'ll miss it! Back up, back up....there it is. That\'s right, it\'s the pseudo mini-mart with a little funky smell to it and here you\'re reading this wondering: "Uh, and why should I buy my meat here?!"\n\nIt\'s the marinade. They need to patent the stuff and license the recipe to Paul Newman. Teriyaki, you have to pick up the teriyaki beef tips. So tender, so juicy...I\'m already coming up with excuses to invite friends over for another BBQ ;)']
["I delayed writing this review for a couple of years because there are some places that you hope stay hidden (or semi-hidden gems). \n\nAn article from the Wall Street Journal says that choice-grade beef hit a record wholesale price last Thursday. So, what do we meat lovers do? Well, if we want to increase our lifespan and help the planet, the simplest thing to do would be to cut back big-time on our beef consumption. Just in case some of you are wondering, beef has the highest carbon footprint of anything we eat. \n\nBut the fact is that as much as I like carrots, cucumbers, chicken, and fish, very few things compare to a great steak or a fantastic hamburger. I thought for a couple of moments about becoming vegetarian, but then I'd be devaluing the feelings of plants. Hey, you think plants don't have some sort of neural system? Check out Venus flytraps or look at the way flowers point towards sunlight. I thought about becoming a pescatarian, but that means I'd be valuing the lives of fish below that of cows, pigs, and lamb, and the truth is I'm a lover not a hater. Btw, if anyone wants a great hamburger recipe, message me. I'm just learning to cook, but I hit on a winner. But I digress...\n\nFor meat lovers, the answer to your problems is to go to McKinnon's Meat Market. Hands down they have the best combination of price and quality you are going to find in Boston. \n\nHow do they do it? There are several ways. First, they butcher their own meat. Second, the only English you'll hear is from the cashiers and guys working behind the deli counter (that's not a racist comment, that's just fact). Third, the owners aren't greedy and realize that their success is based on big volumes. And fourth, the owners have decided that value trumps a nice-looking interior. \n\nA little bit about that last point. When you walk into this place, it's like walking into a museum. I think the youngest refrigerator they have is probably 30+ years old, and they still work great. So I guess it's true that things were built to last back in the day. If the refrigerators seem old, then the floor is ancient. \n\nI'm not sure that this place is the cleanest store I've ever shopped in, but this is one of those rare places where some dirt and a big dose of age, gives this place the appearance of an incredibly dry-aged New York strip (and we all know how delicious those things taste). Think about it like Fenway Park: a place built when value beat the crap out of slick brand marketing of inferior products.\n\nAnother great thing about McKinnon's are the customers. You have welfare recipients with their EBT cards and WIC money rubbing elbows with the well-to-do flashing their AmEx Platinum Cards. Why? Because even if you have a lot of money, the quality is so good that you'll go there. Here's a great example, my barber is Greek (born and raised in Greece) and he's easily pulling in $200,000+ according to my calculations (I'm not joking about that). He says that he gets all his meat, especially lamb, from McKinnon's. If you ever get your hair cut by this guy, you know that quality is marinated into this guy's soul. So, I trust him completely with all the recommendations he has. He hasn't failed me yet. \n\nAnd if the place doesn't have enough charm, there's an elderly woman manning one of the cash registers. She looks like my grandmother's grandmother and gets a mean case of nasal drip going during the winter. Hey, don't worry, that's why they wrap all the meat in cellophane. I love that woman! She's as sharp as a whip and barking orders while running the cash register. \n\nAnd it's not just meat. The place has a good deli and produce section, but you have to inspect your produce really well (and I would never buy anything from there that's bulk wrapped because I've had too many cases of moldy goods). Also, they've got good swordfish and salmon, and you won't find a better price everywhere. \n\nSome reviewers have commented that their stewing meats are lower quality and seem like they're cut from different parts of the animal. Of course they are. That's what stewing meat is supposed to be. It's supposed to be leftover scraps that are not big enough to cook as a larger cut. If you want 100% consistent stewing meat, here are a couple of suggestions:\n\n1) don't make stew. Do you really want to buy a great porterhouse steak and cut it up for a stew?\n\n2) get a big cut of something and slice it yourself. \n\nOne point about their marinated meats. They are good, but one of their chicken marinades is king above all others. I won't say which one it is because it's so hard to find there. No joke. For every 10 times I go there, I'm lucky to find it once. If you are lucky enough to get it, then you'll always buy 7 or 8 packs of it and store the extra in your freezer because that stuff flies off the shelf. \n\nGo to McKinnon's and be amazed, but make sure to leave some meat for me."]
['I\'m new to the neighborhood and came in here for some poultry and fish. \n\nUsually, I\'m used to buying all free range organic poultry but since Whole Foods is so far away, I decided to check this place out.\n\nThe prices are wonderful, the selection is amazing and the marinades like Italian, Honey BBQ, Teriyaki are all just out of this world. For this reason, I keep coming back - and their marinated stuff goes through osmosis so the chicken breasts come out EXTREMELY moist when you cook them (I just pan fry mine). \n\nThe drawback has been seafood for me. I was disappointed in tilapia and clams. The clams I felt were not as fresh because when I cooked them, half of them wouldn\'t open up, which meant they were dead, and the other half made my kitchen stink up so much my roommates politely "left for work" early for like 3 days.\n\nI also don\'t know where the chicken comes from. I mean, is it local? Organic? Free range? Antibiotic free? I asked the girl at the register and she just rolled her eyes at me, but it\'s actually kind of important for me to know. She told me to ask the owner and I have yet to do so.\n\nI will keep coming back here because of how delicious and amazingly inexpensive everything has been - I just hope the chickens are indeed everything I listed above :)']
['Thank you God for the benevolent gift that is McKinnon\'s. What a gem...\nThe prices are like shopping for meat in the 1920s, and everything is great. The cuts are fresh-butchered in house, they\'ve even cut things to order for me and saved my tail for huge dinner parties.\n \n   "You need filet mignon for 60 people? Be right back, I\'ll cut it fresh for ya. That\'ll be $2.69 a pound."\n\nThat place rocks.']
["Like Market Basket, but less fresh.  When I first saw this place, I was hoping it was an old-fashioned local butcher shop where I could walk in and a knowledgeable butcher would get me what I need.  You know, like Sam from the Brady Bunch or something.  Instead its a storefront filled with pre-packaged meats and a small selection of vegetables.\n\nI bought some chicken here awhile back, and after eating it, my stomach didn't return to normal for weeks.  Weeks.  And I have a pretty strong stomach.  I eat raw seafood all the time and I'm always fine afterward.  \n\nI'm all about supporting small businesses and buying local, but only if they offer an experience better than or equal to the big box stores.  Savenor's, Reliable Market and Sherman Market are all far superior to McKinnon's."]
['ahh GOLD MINE. Tiny little market with the CHEAPEST meat around... and the quality ain\'t too shabby either! Came here with an eversave coupon so it was EVEN CHEAPER. ahhh I seriously came outta here with a bag o meat for less than 20 bones, and it\'ll be enough to feed me for the next two weeks.\n\nWHAT I GOT: \n\n3 boneless ribeyes at $4.99/lb\nFresh SUPER LEAN Ground beef at $3.99/lb\nHangar steaks at $2.99/lb,\n\nOH and LOOK OUT for the meats with "Special" stickers on em.. theyre DIRT CHEAP. I got italian seasoned chicken legs for $0.79/lb and burgundy-marinated top sirloin for $2.99 a pound.. and what\'s good about this place is YOU DONT HAVE TO BUY FAMILY PACKS to get these cheap prices!\n\nFINALLY FOUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD MEAT SHOP!']
['I know I am bucking the tide with my low starred review but here goes.\n\nI purchased the original recipe steak tips in a family pack package (around 2.5 lbs).  The taste while OK was much too sweet.  Furthermore, the meat in the package was not only different cuts of meat (some harder than others) it was all different sizes.  It honestly looked like the scraps that were left over were put into a marinade and sold.  To cook it on the grill took a lot of work since I had over 30 little teeny pieces to place, check and flip.\n\nI purchased three "club sirloin" steaks with a use by date of Jan 17 on Jan12.  They went into a cooler with ice packs (I knew it was going to be a while before I got them home), and they were still cold when I put them in my fridge.  On the night of the 14th I wanted to cook them, but they were already brown and smelling rather bad.  Now some people say that aged meat like this is good, but smelly meat to me is bad.  They should have lasted at least until the 17th.  I did not eat them, but instead threw them away.\n\nI also purchased two pounds of  regular steak tips.  They were actually OK, and tasted good, but no better than I get at BJ\'s wholesale club locally.\n\nSo for me McKinnon\'s is not only not worth the trip, but worth avoiding at all costs.\n\n...And don\'t even get me started on spending 15 minutes trying to find a parking space that was within a half mile.']
['Haha "Meat Mecca" "Meatalicious" "Meaterrific" "Meat-tastic" on and on and on. These reviews don\'t lie. \n\nLiving in the Boston area you certainly have your choice of places to buy pricey meat -- Whole Foods, Savenor\'s, even Trader Joe\'s. But if you\'re on a budget, like a great deal, or love to see rows and rows of chopped up animal carcass then this is the place for you.\n\nI have purchased a variety of items here but the most remarkable were the filet mignon. Man, they were ONLY $5.99 per pound, that is BEYOND A DEAL, that is amazing. The meat was fantastic too when I cooked it, juicy, fresh, tender.\n\nThey also sell a handfull of produce, dairy products, and dried goods which I have never been disappointed by. The only gripe I have about this pace is that it\'s got a bit of a foul odor -- but hey, it\'s a MEAT MARKET!']
["I've been going here for more than 5 years now. There is always a special and their chicken and beef are the best priced meats around. Its quite the hike for me since I'm coming from Boston, but I have my routine.\n\nI get my haircut at Dante's and then buy $20 worth of meet which is equivalent to spending $50 at Shaws/Stop and Shop at McKinnon's.\n\nPretty consistent and they have all the typical meats but a small assortment of seafood (I wouldn't recommend going here for this). Reminds me of butcher shop from the 70s. The best deal is the $1.49 pound of Purdue ground chicken. \n\nAll their marinated stuff is good too, but that's why I like getting raw meat...so I can do it myself."]
['Quite simply, McKinnon\'s cannot be beat.  I really don\'t understand how they do it.  I go here for chicken breast, any cut of steak, bacon, ground turkey, oh boy I could go on and on.  They are super helpful here too.  When I needed 12 pounds of steak to make steak and guiness pie for a crowd (which, by the by, I HEARTILY recommend you make sometime), I spoke with a guy on the phone who walked me through the different cuts that could work and assured me there would be enough.\n\nI wouldn\'t necessarily come here for fish.  Frozen shrimp is a great buy.  I don\'t think the fish is bad or anything, but it is a meat market after all.\n\nIt almost mystifies me how cheap meat it here.  I was a bit skeptical at first--I figured cheap meat must mean some combination of industrial agrobusiness on steroids, weird hormones in my food, or mistreatment of workers.  However, from what I can tell this is NOT the case.  A friend who has been going there for years told me they keep their prices so low because they cut all their meat in house, which cuts out the middle "butcher" man.  Good enough for me.\n\nLocal place, a Somerville staple, incredible value...what\'s not to love?']
["Several years ago I would have rated them 5 stars, for both meat quality and affordability. I remember a number of my friends being laid off in the summer of '01 and having weekly barbecues, and the steaks and chicken that I brought from McKinnon's were always far tastier than the meat that others had picked up at Shaw's or S&amp;S, and it was usually at least half the price.\n\nThe prices are still just low enough to undercut the supermarkets, but the meat quality seems to have dropped. Maybe it's me, but I no longer like the taste of the beef or sausage - both seem completely flavorless, and sometimes the beef has a strange look to it (like little spots are rotting?!) The last time I bought a steak there I ended up tossing half of it away, a couple months ago, due to the complete lack of flavor/blandness, even after marinading for a day."]
['Really cheap, great deli, vegtibles, and of course meet. \n\nThe steaktips are awesome!!!\n\n4 stars because it smells really bad behind it and I smell it everyday when I walk bu.']
['VEGETARIANS BEWARE, DON\'T READ THIS REVIEW OR ANY McKINNON\'S REVIEW!\n\nMy wife has always shopped for our meats here, and has always chastised me for spending too much at Shaw\'s for meats.  She finally got me to go with her today to help pick some stuff out.\n\nWowzeewowwow! This place is MEAT HEAVEN, and it\'s SOOOOOO CHEAP.  I must say, I\'m wondering if they have the stock in back of the store or something, otherwise how could they just basically GIVE away such QUALITY meats???\n\nThey have this beef steak pinwheel thing that I love. It\'s a steak, with the middle filled with spinach and cheese. They run out of these quickly, so grab \'em while you can.  Delmonico steaks, Filet Mignon cuts, any cut you like, pot roasts, chuck beef, tips, they will have it. Chicken and turkey galore.\n\nStay away from that freezer that runs down the middle of the store, there are some very scary things in there: chicken claws, beaks, tongues,organs, etc.- unless, that\'s your thing.\n\nAnyway, I will never shop for meat anywhere else.  I will stay on the train two extra stops to Davis.  \n\nTo my wife, who kept insisting that I come in, instead of waiting in the car, or sending her alone, thanks honey for making a believer out of me!\np.s. The store is spotlessly clean, but it does smell like a "meat market", which is great to me, but if it bothers you, send someone else in.']
["So originally I thought this place was a higher end butcher shop until I finally went in. The prices are really reasonable and you can buy a whole pig here. \n\nBut, there are a couple reasons I don't usually shop at McKinnon's that often. For one thing, the quality of the cold cuts just aren't that good. The second thing is the real deal breaker for me, the steaks, they are just not good quality. Every time I have bought a steak from McKinnon's I have been disappointed. I'd rather pay $2-3 more a pound to get a higher quality steak. I have had a few higher quality cuts from them and I have been disappointed each time. I know how to season and cook steaks, so it's not me that's the problem.\nThe staff there is really nice though.\n\nUltimately I can sum up McKinnon's with: You get what you pay for."]
['I recognize that this place is primarily a deli, and I believe all the other reviewers that the meats are amazing.  That said, I was pretty unhappy with my experience today (maybe I got what I deserved for going to a deli for produce).\n\nFirst, in the first package of oranges I picked up, one was covered in white mold.  I\'m not talking about a speck of mold--the whole thing was moldy.\n\nSecond, most of the packages of strawberries looked dilapidated at best.  They had brown spots and were beginning to mold.\n\nThird, the pre-packaged, pre-cut fruit looked generally unwell.\n\nGranted, maybe it was just a bad day.  What bothered me, however, was the attitude of the check-out folks.  I told them--quite politely, I thought--that the strawberries were turning bad.  They responded, "well, if you don\'t like them, don\'t buy them."  I told them, "ok, I just thought you might want to a heads up so other folks don\'t buy bad fruit."  They went on to tell me how many boxes of strawberries they had sold today... ok?\n\nAlso, thought they close at 7:00 PM, they locked the door around 6:50 and were less than friendly to folks trying to come a few minutes before 7:00 PM (though, in their defense, they did ultimately let those folks in).\n\nThe prices are, indeed, great, so I will probably be back, but rotten fruit and rude people make me sad :-(']
['McKinnon\'s meat market is by far my favorite store in Davis. From their juicy yet inexpensive cuts of meat to pre-marinated pork roasts, it has all my meat needs. Even their veggie selection, though small, is inexpensive and has everything I usually use. Best of all, they have great customer service and has the "small store" feel.']
["Hella.  Awesome.\n\nThis is the cheapest place around for some delectable meats.  I went with my brother when we wanted to chill around our own BBQ instead of sitting down to dinner.  We left with over 10lbs of meat (don't worry.. we didn't grill it all) and a bit of produce.  Trust me, we didn't go here for the produce.\n\nI highly recommend stocking up on chicken fillets here (super cheap compared to other places.. just put in ziplocs and freeze for the long haul).  Their steak tips are amazing, ALWAYS GO WITH THE HOUSE MARINADE.  It's super AWESOME.\n\nThe only thing I have to say it's smaller than their larger store that is in Northern MA, which I have also been to once.  But still amazing for Somerville on Elm St.\n\nPretty busy, so make your selection and get the hell outta there.\n\nThings on the super cheap:\nChicken breasts/cuts\nGround Beef\nSteak unmarinated\n\nThings on the super delicious (but not the most cheap):\nAnything house marinated\n\nI was a little disappointed with the Cordon Bleu.. but all I did was unwrap and throw in the oven."]
["Pop a seat and let me tell you about McKinnon's. McKinnon's is your traditional meat market. I'm talking about you want Filet Mignon, they got it. You want pork chops, they got it. Yo, chicken heart? Son, they got that, too! \nThis place makes me so excited. Their meat is SO %$*#ing fresh and it's MADD CHEAP. I know, I know, Angie doesn't usually get ghetto with reviews but, honestly, when a place is as awesome as this, I kinda get ghetto. .. w/e. Don't judge me!\nThis is how awesome McKinnon's is: I live in Coolidge Corner and I trek out there to get meat. When I lived in Forest Hills I trekked out to McKinnon's. If you haven't bought meat from there, you need to get it on. NOW!"]
['Love this place. Great place to find a good deal on the usual stuff like steak tips, pork, and chicken. Love the pre marinated meats they have. Cajun chicken is awesome!']
["I have been going to McKinnon's for a few years now and I've yet to be disappointed.  I stopped buying my meat at the local supermarkets because their meat just can't compare.  My usual purchases are chicken parts, steak tips and ground beef, but I have sampled other varieties of meat. Their chicken is tastier and meatier and I'm never searching to find skin-on, bone-in (which seems to be pretty rare in supermarkets these days).   I do occasionally buy produce, but it isn't always the freshest, but I can't complain either, it works in a pinch.\n\nThe best aspect for me is that it's conveniently located on my work commute.  It is a small store and it does get packed, but for the prices, I can deal with the crowds."]
['Just the other day, I walked into Mckinnon\'s and overheard fat man number 1 say to fatter dude number 2: "welcome to heaven".  There really couldn\'t be a better seal of approval. Every time I come here I walk out with a week\'s worth of dinners for $20. Even my roommate has declared it "better than hotpockets", i\'m so proud  :-) \n\nit gets pretty busy around closing time, but they\'re usually nice enough to let people in for a grab and go. OH, and a dollar for 2 packs of hotdogs?! at least i know where to go when I finally hit rock bottom.']
["Though I've been spoiled by Dom's in Medford, I will always have a place in my heart for McKinnon's.  I can swing in and pick up a pork shoulder as easy as kiss my hand.  I can get cold cuts, cheeses, that onion I forgot at the supermarket.  With ground meats of all types and nicely trimmed steak and chicken, this place could easily stand as the only butcher you could ever really need."]
["Great prices, fresh products, nice staff. The lines are usually long and it smells like a meat locker in here but you won't beat the prices and quality at any other local butcher."]
["McKinnon's got your basic meats like chicken, turkey, beef, and pork, and they got your fancier meats like lamb, veal, goat, and rabbit. They've got fish, they've got eggs, they've got sausages, they've got marinated meats, stuffed meats, ground meats, meat, meat, meat. If you need meat, you ought to get your meat here.\n\nAlso, they have vegetables."]
["It's cheap and it's well stocked. You're not gonna find a place with cheaper chicken (roasting, breasts, thighs...you name it) or ground meat (especially chicken and turkey). That said, you also get what you pay for. I've never had an issue with their poultry, but you're probably better off buying steaks elsewhere. Also keep a lookout for their seafood -- usually pretty cheap and decent quality!"]
['House marinated tips alone make this place worth the stop. Burgundy steaks, a good variety of sausages on top of their other specialty meats will keep you coming back (along with their prices).']
['I was sold rotten wings for the Super Bowl. When cooked they smelled like rotten fish and were discolored. I called to ask for a refund and the manager, Jimmy, told me he needed the product back for a refund....I threw them out?? No apology and was really quite rude. NEVER buying from them again.']
['Excellent cuts of meat. It always has plenty of high quality hanger steak in stock which I have struggled to find elsewhere in town. Also some excellent seafood.']
["We try to stop by at least once a week, 'cause the meats are good and the prices are insane, which means we can feed several friends or, you know, overdo it ourselves. \n\n$20 for ten pork chops &amp; three containers of brussels sprouts? We fed eight people on that! It's kind of impossible to resist.\n\nYes, to echo pretty much everyone, the clerks are cranky, but come on. Ten minutes and you're out the door, pockets still stuffed with cash. A fine thing, if you ask me."]
["Two things you need to know about me.\n\nA. I am insanely frugal/cheap, I am constantly comparing prices and quality of everything everywhere looking for the best deal.\n\nB. I Love meat, all kinds, specifically, steak, chicken and seafood, in that order.\n\nMckinnons is the only spot I will ever purchase meat again. All the meat i've bought there has been good quality and fresh. And there prices are better than any supermarket even when they have sales. There deli also has very good prices as well. Produce was more or less on par with grocery stores in terms of prices. Selection was great, variety was great, went on a saturday afternoon and I was able to get in and out in no time. Not sure what else I would ask for."]
["Great sausage, quality meats.  I love this place.  \n\nParking is the only problem, especially on the weekends.  But I'll walk pretty far for some meat."]
['This place is great. The meat is so fresh, and much cheaper than the grocery store. Not often can you get a better product for a lower price.  They sell excellent Romano cheese for 4.99 a pound!   The same stuff is 9.99 a pound at star market!']
["If you are looking for inexpensive meats, and seafood in Somerville- look no further. If you are looking for a calm atmosphere, and a super clean/organized store, you miiight wanna keep looking. \n\nThis is a down an dirty place to grab up some cheap cuts of meat. I purchased some marinated chicken and a few other cuts while I was there the other day. Waited in a fairly long line (considering the square footage of the place...) and was in and out in a fairly short period of time. \n\nMy boyfriend's grandma used to shop here, so I hear, if it's good enough for her-it's good enough for me! \n\nIt was a little dicey to get around everybody to pick up what I needed. So I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that Saturday mid-afternoon isn't a fantastic time of day to stroll into this place. I plan on being better prepared next time. Definitely better prices than at your local big named grocery store, and if you have an eye for pieces of meat, you can't go wrong."]
["McKinnon's has the highest quality meat and cheaper than any brick and mortar store in town. I've been buying fresh meat here for 2 months now and it has always been consistently high quality.\n\nOne thing I am not a fan of is the pre-seasoned and pre-made stuff, however, I have tried it and it's not bad, I just tend to prefer cooking/baking my own stuff. Otherwise, this place is a gem and a good old-fashioned butcher.\n\n**EDIT**\n\nTurns out this place gets its meat from major manufacturers of meat like Purdue chicken etc so I'm notching it down to 3 stars. I was under impression it was a local butcher with locally-sourced meat whose animals are treated at least somewhat humanely. But instead it's just another meat factory outlet. The quality of the meat is superior to what you will find in groceries and cheaper but I'm not happy about the way they get their products."]
["There is not much I can say about McKinnon's that has not already been said.  Its prices are phenomenal for quality cuts of meat, mainly because that is what it specializes in-meat.  There are some produce items there and other grocery staples like sauces and bread if you need something to complement your meal but let's get down to the nitty gritty here, folks.  McKinnon's is a meat market.  MEAT.\n\nChicken, depending on the cut, is $1.99-$2.69 per pound with no tucked fat.  After bringing it home and opening it, you have barely any trimming work to do.  With supermarket meat that is absolutely unheard of and you pay at least twice as much.  \n\nI will admit, I mainly go to get loads of super inexpensive chicken but have bought a variety of other meats like turkey and pork there with no problems with price or quantity.  So just go and get some meat to grill, broil, bake, or fry (if you must).  Enjoy!\n\nAs far as how it's run, it seems to be family run or at least run by a tight group of people as most of the staff is on the older side and are charming in the townie kind of way. They are not open super late, but do not close super early either (7 on weekdays, 5? on Sundays).  Also, their checkout process has grown ever more efficient in the past two years with new technology for credit cards and scanning their items.  Kudos to them for embracing technology more than I do.\n\nThe only star off is for the deli department as it does not offer low sodium options for turkey or cheese (most importantly) and the cold cuts they offer are not brands I particularly care for.  Overall though, I save nearly all of my meat shopping for McKinnon's and it makes me crave the days I was not alive for with the milk man, the paper boy, and the evening tv...wait a minute..."]
["One of my favorite shops in Davis.\n\nLike many, I was at first highly sceptical.  How could this meat be so cheap? Why does it smell funny inside? Why doesn't anyone under the age of 80 work at the cash registers?\n\nAll of my fears turned out to be unfounded.  McKinnon's meat is of great quality - if not the best, I could still eat one of their steaks every night for dinner and die a happy man. Not only happy, I'd die a rich man, cause McKinnon's is ridiculously cheap.  Like, I can't buy chicken at normal grocery stores now because I know for the same price per pound I could be eating steak.\n\nSeriously, you want to roast a chicken? less than $1.00/lb. Rub some butter under it's skin and toss that bird in the oven and you've got a date-quality dinner in under an hour and under five bucks.  How could McKinnon's NOT be your favorite meat shop in the 'Ville?"]
["This place has higher quality meat than Shaw's, Market Basket, Foodmaster etc. With a better selection than any of them, and it's priced at Market Basket's sale price. \n\nThis is the place to buy meat."]
["This year I volunteered to make the turkey for our annual Pre-Thanksgiving Pot-luck.  I knew a plain old supermarket turkey wouldn't do, so I did a quick search on Yelp for a suitable place to procure my bird.  McKinnon's was the highest rated, so a few weeks before my event, I rang them up and ordered my turkey. I spoke to Eric on the phone and he was very helpful.  He said it wouldn't be a problem, but that I should phone a few days before I needed it, just in case. \n\nI arrived on a Friday evening to pick up my monstrous turkey (I ordered a 25 pounder) and I was lucky enough to get a parking spot right out front.  I walked in and asked the guy at the meat counter about my bird.  He nearly gave me a heart attack when he said they weren't getting the fresh turkeys til next week.  Luckily, after explaining that I had special ordered it, he quickly sorted it out.  I had my turkey in less than 5 minutes, which was especially great because I didn't have any quarters for the meter.  The turkey was also very reasonably priced at $1.69 per pound.  \n\nAnd wow, was this turkey great!  I slaved over it all day, carefully stuffing it, basting it and glazing it.  When it came out it was crispy and golden on the outside and super moist on the inside.  While I credit myself with most of its perfection, I couldn't have done it without McKinnon's!\n\nI'll definitely be back for some more quality meat at reasonable prices!"]
["Love the selection and prices. It's the only place I ever go to for meat. Barbecues have become affordable again!\n\nDeli staff is great.\n\nCons:\n-Usually over-crowded (due to awesomeness).\n-Checkout clerks are kinda cranky."]
["BEST. STEAK. TIPS. EVER.\n\nI feel like there's very little to be said beyond that. Their house marinated steak tips are some of the best things that I've ever tasted. Not only is the marinade delicious, but the meat grills up nice and juicy and tender. The steak tips alone would be enough to keep me coming back to this place.\n\nBut wait...there's more....\n\nThey have amazing prices on every other cut of meat imaginable. Boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Marinated chicken breasts. Steaks. Ground beef. You name it, they have it and it's probably cheaper and fresher than Shaw's. \n\nYes, it's a bit small inside and it has a bit of a smell, but that's because it's a butcher. What do you expect? It's going to have a bit of a smell. I'm not sure why anyone would want to buy produce here. I have to admit that I've never looked at it, but, it's a meat market. Why would you want to buy produce there? \n\nSeriously, though, you must try the steak tips. ASAP."]
["This is a good place to buy beef, pork, lamb and the deli items.  I tend to buy what I am going to use in the next day or two (what I try to do with everything) and have never had a problem with the quality.\n\nI do not buy seafood or chicken here. I haven't had a bad experience.  I just like the quality of product that I am getting from Courthouse seafood and Mayflower Poultry so why mess with it."]
["I would say it's actually unclear just how McKinnon's gets away with setting its meat prices as low as it does. It regularly beats out large grocery chains -- even bulk food places like BJ's. Has it just been in Davis for so long that its rent is a pittance? Are they running an underground heroin/prostitution ring out back that subsidizes the front? Are they actually just selling people meat?\n\nUnclear. What is clear is that McKinnon's has consistently excellent prices on consistently fresh meat. Produce is clearly an afterthought, and doesn't share the deals or always the quality. The offerings are something to pick up at the last minute because you forgot you needed tomatoes to go with your steak, not somewhere to do your weekly shopping. Oh well. Remember your carrots next time and you won't have to pick one up here. At least you don't have to make two stops.\n\nCaveat to the experience: The place smells like old raw meat. That slightly putrid smell that you feel in the back of your throat telling you something is wrong. You can smell it walking down the street if you're coming from the back. It hits you like a wave when you walk in the door.\n\nSo it goes. They sell a lot of meat. It's only natural that they would smell like their product. Crinkle your nose, pick up some ridiculous-sale chicken, and make yourself an entirely affordable meal."]
["People are suspicious of this meat b/c it is so cheap. It isn't premium quality, but it is at least as good as the big supermarkets and a little more than half the price. \n\nGo to McKinnons on a summer day, spend 30 bucks, have a bbq with 15 guests. What could be better?"]
['Cheap.\n\nMeat.\n\nTastes good.\n\nIf you can swing  with non-free range happy cow meat this is a great place. If not there is always the farmer market in the square on Wednesdays.']
["This place is pretty much amazing. They almost every meat you can imagine and really good prices. My last purchase was wings for the superbowl and I only paid about $5 for 2.5 pounds of chicken wings and wingettes. I also appreciate the deli counter inside, where you can get low salt cheese and low salt meats. The service is very fast, and the people behind the deli counter are very friendly. One of the guys working there just had a baby boy, and he's still cheerful. This place is a meat shop, and they don't mess around so if you need meat this is the place to go."]
['I go to this place every weekend to buy food for the following week. The prices are unbeatable even by whole sale club standards. The meats are fresh and very inexpensive. Things like New york sirloin $2.99 a pound, $1.99 bacon...SHUT UP!!\n Oh! i almost forgot about $3.50 pr lb. land-o-lakes pre-sliced American cheese. \nSuper good food, super cheep prices and a tiny store thats always is busy.']
["My roommate had given me the heads up on McKinnon's some time ago but I rarely get to Davis Square unless I happen to be in the area (even though I live less than a mile from there). So when the weather happened to be nice the other day, I took a stroll over and I was not disappointed! They had so much fresh meat and fish! And the prices were really reasonable. I bought 2 good size filet mignon steaks for around $6. And they weren't just any steaks....they were as filet should be; VERY tender. The fish was reasonable priced and fresh and I got a big bag of fresh green beans for around $2. \n\nOverall, this is one sausage-fest / meat market that I actually don't mind going to. I will be back!"]
['My grandmother and mother have been customers here since the 1950s, and it seems the prices of the meats are stuck in 1957.\n\nGood quality meats, half the price of meats at Shaws or Market Basket.\n\n\nHighly recommended!']
["A true throwback to the days when people bought their meet from real butchers! And the prices are incredible... like 50% cheaper than the 'stuff' you would get at the super wal-mart. And the service is exceptional as well. Everthing you would ever want regarding buying meet in a single store!"]
['"Wow, they have a bigger selection and are cheaper than Roxie\'s!" exclaimed the boy, five minutes after I brought him to McKinnon.  And indeed, McKinnon has a huge selection of meat at great prices.\n\nIn addition to the standard chicken, beef, pork parts, along with ground turkey, McKinnon also carries stuff you wouldn\'t find in typical places.  Love white turkey meat but don\'t want to cook the whole turkey?  McKinnon has it.  Want marinaded meat but too lazy to do it yourself?  McKinnon has marinaded chicken, turkey, beef, pork and lamb (yes, marinaded lamb!) all in stock.  There are also several marinades to choose from.  McKinnon also carries goat meat if you\'re looking to make a Jamaican-inspired dish.  The meat thus far has been tasty.\n\nBesides raw meat, McKinnon also carries deli meat at decent prices.  They also have a small section of fish, though having not bought it, I can\'t vouch for quality.\n\nMy only beef with this place (ha ha ha), is that they don\'t put the ingredients on the labels of their marinaded products, so if you have allergies to anything, you pretty much need to guess unless you can find someone to help you who knows.']
["Bought some rib eye steaks here the other day to take our new cast iron skillet out for a test drive. Less than $7 for two ~.5 lbs delicious cuts of meat. With these prices, I don't see any reason why we'd ever buy meat anywhere else. Plus while we were they I saw that they have whole rabbits. Guess who's making a stew!\n\nThe only downside is that it gets insanely crowded, but you can hardly blame them for being popular."]
["CHEAP!!!!!! Actually, more accurately, INEXPENSIVE. Cheap would tarnish the name of this fine establishment.\n\nLooking for inexpensive meat? Here's the place! The marinated meats are almost the same price as the raw ones. Good flavor and LOTS of choices! \n\nThe best thing is? Compared to most meat markets, I didn't notice a smell.\n\nHow to get there? You can take the red line or the bus or get street parking.\n\nIn and out. Great deals! I live by Roxie's and I'd make the trip up here for the good deals."]
["When I first moved near Davis and McKinnon's was the closest meat shop to my place, I was a bit skeptical - how can everything there be so cheap without sacrificing quality? Why does it always smell in there?\n\nThis skepticism was highly unwarranted. We're talking good meat and seriously great prices. For the price, the only thing that compare is super-specials at the grocery store - and we're talking Foodmaster, not Whole Foods - and the meat at McKinnon's is reliably good and ALWAYS that cheap. Burger patties, steak, chicken, pork tenderloin - all about half or a third of what you'd pay anywhere else.\n\nThe seafood is sketchy and the produce section is hit-or-miss, but if you're at McKinnon's for that, you're doing it wrong.\n\nUnfortunately, the tradeoff for such fabulous deals is an outrageously early 6pm closing time. Why, McKinnon's, why?  Some of us need meat after work, you know."]
['My sister moved to Davis about a year ago and has since told me on a semi-daily basis how urgently I "need to rep McKinnon\'s". Girl did not steer me wrong. I made dinner for 6 people and got everything I needed at McK\'s for $33! That includes seasoned chicken breast (didn\'t eat it -- I\'m vegetarian, but no complaints from the eaters), some crazy authentic pasta that was shaped like jellyfish or something, legit Italian olive oil, mad cheese, and a grip of asparagus and tomatoes. What.\nFor price and meat selection, 5 stars. I have to shave off a little for pitiful cheese variety, though, as well as Shaw\'s priced and less than fresh veggies. But don\'t even talk to me Farmer\'s Bounty -- I\'mma rep Mckinnon\'s on the exclusive tip.']
["I went today (finally). 1.89 pounds of really nice top round steak with three days left on the code for $5.60. Wow. And it was delicious. Chicken wings are something like 89 cents per pound this week. Go to their website and check out their weekly flyer for specials prices. \n\nI will likely be going here every Saturday and every possible weekday when I want to buy meat. Oh and by the way, for everyone, if you want a good selection of vegetables to go with your meat, go across the street. I can't remember the name of the place, but they have a big sign for veggies (it's really just a convenience store with a nice produce section). They had good fresh stuff. Some random stuff too (young coconut, peeled). I will check them out again next time I go to McKinnon's."]
["If you live in the Cambridge/Somerville area and you're a carnivore and you're not shopping at McKinnon's, you should be ashamed, VERY ashamed.  \n\nThis place is super sweet, yes at times super smelly (brace yourself as you walk in the door), but then be prepared to gasp when you see the prices on the meats! Chicken, beef, pork, veal, seafood, even vegetables and sauces. I've been here several times and will never buy my meat anywhere else. Today I purchased: a whole chicken for $4.80! Three sirloin steaks for $7. Three HUGE boneless skinless chicken breasts for $4. Are you kidding me? One might be skeptical because of the low prices but the meat here is high quality. \n\nMentally prepare yourself for the smell but be blown away by the prices and quality!!!"]
["ok, I've been going to McKinnon's for many years and would give it five stars.  Yesterday, I went to buy hamburg for my dog's occasional treat.  I bought the family pack that looked good and fresh.  When I opened it at home the outside was nice and pink, but the inside was filled with all brown older hamburg.  Thank goodness it was for my dog!  If I didn't live so far, I would have taken it back. Shame on you McKinnon's, I'm disappointed."]
['If I want me some meat, I go here. Damn this place has a good selection. I never really tried the deli itself but the veggies are fresh, meat is fresh and cheap as well. \n\nSteak tips are the shit. fennel sausage the shit. man its just so cheap and so good. the meat might not last that long because i havent left things i bought here for a while but i heard its not that great after a couple days. It can definitely get crowded but seriously i was trippin ballls with the prices and good food.\n\nGreat food, AMAZING prices.']
['London Broil for $1.99 a pound?\nSausages, 5 for around $3?\nSausages (5), with a week left before the Sell By date for 79 cents?!?\n\nAll these and more can be yours at McKinnons. On my last visit, we left with over 10 pounds of meat for under $20. They only lose a star for not having the best hours.\n\nAnd no...no one died from the 79 cent sausages. They were actually really good!']
["At the end of a lovely day in Davis, my boyfriend and I went home with a backpack loaded with McKinnon's meat. Hard not to buy out the place considering the bargains. This is an old-school meat market with prices to match. Pork tenderloin for $2.99/lb? Filet mignon for $6.99? Cornish game hens at $0.79! The cost is easily half or a third what you'd pay at any other grocery. I have no idea how they're doing it.\n\nI braced myself for a monkey poo smell based on other reviews, but it really isn't offensive. It doesn't smell sterile like Shaw's, but then I've always found it strange to be surrounded by food and not smell a thing."]
['A carnivore\'s dream.  Every meat that Americans would consume can be found here in this little shop.  \n\nI\'ve never cooked rabbit, nor have I asked myself, "Hmmm, where might I buy rabbit meat?"  McKinnon has rabbit... whole rabbit, about the size of an average chicken.  You can also get goat, lamb, and deeply disturbing parts of chickens... trays of chicken hearts, livers, etc.\n\nBesides the meat, there is a cute corner dedicated to fresh veggies, as well as a deli counter.\n\nThe staff has always been friendly... and it feels good to shop locally and support the community.']
["OLD SCHOOL MEAT STORE! Love it!\nI'm a single guy with limited space to store meat and limited ability to eat a lot of meat ... but when I'm having people over to my place this is where I go to get ready for the crowd. Great tasting meat and fish at great prices."]
['As good as it gets, 3 filet mignons for 5.80 cents. 3 days of chicken tenderloins for 4 bucks.  and a whole boatload of chicken hearts for my dog for 1.50.  NEVER  buying meat from a supermarket again.  Not so super anymore are you??!\n\nWish this was a better kept secret, I want this to be MY store.. but here, i am sharing it with the world because sometimes, well sometimes Im just a superman.  I would advise all to go at a non-busy time, you can probably figure out when that is.']
['Now I have never actually been to McKinnons. My boyfriend brings things home from them all the time, and all I do is prepare them, eat them, and cry tears of joy at how small the price on the receipt is. They have a great selection of more "exotic" meats than what a supermarket might carry, and at supermarket prices. I can\'t wait to go myself one of these days!']
['prices are beyond reasonable and staff are willing to accommodate special orders which is great when your family needs an entire lamb butchered for a weekend bbq :)']
['So cheap and everything is fresh.Everytime I go here rather than the regular supermarket I save about half the money I would have spent.']
["Well... since I consume about 6-8 chicken breasts per day (I weigh-lift, which requires enormous amounts of protein) McKinnon's has become my purveyor of that protein. I also get extra lean beef there and both are cheaper than Costco. So 5 stars for prices on meats.\n\nPlus, if you want a particular cut of meat, you just ask the owner and they will get you whatever you want. Heck, want half a goat, he will get you one. Want to walk out the door with quarter of the cow, he got you covered in a jiffy.\n\nSelection other stuff gets 3 stars, because most stuff in the deli is stale, produce is over-priced, and fish is questionable.\nWhere it gets bad is the attitude you get from some of the checkout people who seem to not like that I pay with a credit card. The little dude gives you a stink-eye if you are handing anything else but cash. Guess what, I never have cash with me, I don't like cash, so you will just have to get over it.\nOwner of the place is a nice guy, but before you get the VIP service, you will have to spend lots of $ with him."]
["The cheapest place to buy meats and fish in all of Somerville (possibly Boston too). They have every imaginable protein-related item in their store, plus an array of fresh vegetables and a compact but excellent deli area. They have read-to-cook marinaded items as well as perhaps the best Rib-Eye steaks I've ever had."]
['When you walk into McKinnon\'s, you are overwhelmed with two strong feelings:\n\n1: "My grandmother would love to shop here, and she would be proud of me for shopping here"\n2: "Holy crap that smells like MEAT"\n\nSeriously. It smells like meat so bad. But not in a bad way. The meat, as far as I\'m concerned is very well priced, they have some awesome prepackaged meat meals, like Pork with Apple stuffing, they have spices at a price lower than some places (like Shaw\'s, the Spice Price bandits), good sized deli, and small vegetable area. \n\nLike, if you got all your groceries at McKinnon\'s, you wouldn\'t be eating gross-ass processed food anymore. And I kinda like that in a grocery store. \n\nPlus there\'s always like a super old guy leaving just as I\'m leaving.']
["McKinnon's, McKinnon's. You appeal to the darker parts of me - the parts that think $0.69 per pound chicken is too good a deal to pass up - but outrage my inner tree-hugger. With prices like these, there is clearly no way these chickens or cows or any of their meaty little friends had anything approaching a decent life before being made into the most budget of burgers.\n\nThat said, the prices just can't be beat - especially if you're cooking for a crowd. You don't even need to wait for things on sale - chicken wings are always well under $2 a pound, and the burgers are scandalously cheap (and the meat is ground and made into patties in-house).\n\nThat said, though, it's really not the place you go for a great cut of steak, or that perfect roaster chicken to make with a little salt and pepper and not much else. Everything is a bit meh - completely fresh, but really lacking in deliciousness. I shopped here for the first few months I moved here, but now I've mostly moved on, to buy a bit less somewhere pricier that promises a bit more flavor!"]
["You simply can't go wrong with Mckinnon's.  They have the best steak tips I have ever had in my life and their selection of meat's cannot be beat.  Everything is super fresh and they have every type and cut of meat you can think of.  Sure, the line gets long (it's no secret that McKinnon's has great meats and rock bottom prices) but it moves quickly and the cashier's work very hard to get you checked out fast."]
['Shopped at McKinnons before.  Won\'t deny the value if you\'re on a budget, especially if you\'re willing to ignore the generally shoddy butchering.  The meat often looks like its been hacked apart with a drywall saw.\n\nHowever, this has been a disappointing week.  Visited Wednesday evening looking for a full brisket.  You know, untrimmed, fresh off the cow, for the smoker.  The butchers were all gone, the deli guy took a look.  "Can\'t find it.  Call tomorrow."\n\nCalled 9am Thursday morning.  "Yeah, we got briskets."  Showed up too late on Thursday.  Butchers were gone and the checkout guy couldn\'t find the brisket.\n\nStopped by Friday morning.  Caught the butchers at work.  Asked for a brisket.  The markings on the cryo-vac indicated something was amiss - "Sirloin Strip" and "$5/lb".  Uh-oh.  Upon inspection the 11-pound side had no point (second cut).  A very thin fat cap.  And no grain (just wavy marbling).  They had no briskets, so they tried to give me short loin!  If I didn\'t know any better, I would have finished my 14-hour smoke with shoe leather. \n\nYou can\'t consider them a serious butcher if they\'re doing this.  If you need a flock of boneless/skinless chicken to fill out your P90x menu, hit this place up.  If you want high quality or attention to detail, go elsewhere.']
["I love this place - it has turned me into a more open and less stagnant carnivore by introducing a host of new little animals/animal parts to devour.  Seriously, interesting meats here, like tubs of chicken hearts, octopus, rabbits, chicken feet (pretty much any chicken part, I think), goat, etc.\n\nI can go home and pretend I'm survivorman, roasting a wild rabbit over a Weber grill that I'll start with nothing but twigs - survival at its finest.\n\nSo yeah, go here and buy some meat.  Everything is cheap, as noted, and Anna's is right across the street, giving you a great chance to have a burrito and save a ton on meat."]
['When I first found this place, I was intrigued based on the pricing and amount of meat there, and by the idea of being able to go to a "real" butcher.  The smell is as mentioned by many others- pretty gross, along the lines of wet dog but I ignored it at first for the sake of cheap, mass quantities of meat.  You can always get boneless chicken breast for ~1.69/lb or so and filet mignon for 6.99-7.99/lb or so, but the truth is, the meat just is not particularly high quality.  As others have mentioned you\'ll often see meat that looks wayyy past it\'s prime sitting out among everything else.  When I stopped by on Monday to check it out, there were 4 roasts sitting out, three of which looked OK, and one of which was slimy and an unappetizing shade of brown/grey.  I decided to give the steaks one more chance since some of the Delmonicos looked pretty decent and picked up a three pack.  I froze two of them that night and when I went to grill the other one 2 days later, I found it had already turned gray on one side with splotches on the other side.  I understand you get what you pay for, but spoiled meat isn\'t worth saving a few bucks.  \nWhile I have occasionally had a really good steak from here, I\'d say about half the time it tends to be tough/chewy/stringy meat- inconsistent to say the least. The chicken breasts and thighs are normally fine but definitely less tender than many other places I\'ve bought from.  \nWhile it\'s not what everyone is looking for, this place is definitely not your local/neighborhood butcher you go to to chat about different cuts of meats, and they don\'t have anything along the lines of dry aged steak/grass fed/organic meat that you might expect at an actual butcher. It feels much more like an outlet shop for mostly prepackaged meat (albeit sometimes poor packaged).\nOverall, for beef I\'d suggest checking out Hilltop or even the other Mckinnon\'s (which I think must be owned by different people) not too far away in Everett, where you can often find sirloin strip for $3.99 a pound.  For cheaper meats, this place will probably fit the bill.']
['just went here for the first time and got chicken for hella cheap that was marinaded. thank you, meat people! you are dope and your okra rocked my face!']
['I like this store because it is convenient and has great prices. My only complaint is that the "packaged on" date for a package of vegetables that I bought today is tomorrow. Yes, the "packaged on" date is in the future. I like to think that is a simple mistake, and whoever was packaging the vegetables thought they were putting an expiration date, but it makes me a little wary and I wonder if they fudge any other dates on foods.']
["MEAT, GLORIOUS MEAT!  McKinnon's is the best place around to buy meats.  Wether you're looking for delicious marinated steak tips, various roasts, or brave enough to go for offal, this is the place to go.  They also have a small veggie section so it's one stop shopping for a grillable meal.  It's also super cheap, so being the frugal, miserly gentleman I am, i can't go there enough."]
["It smells like dead fish. I'm intimately familiar with this smell because a restaurant I worked in had me clean the walk in one day. And I opened a fish tub with no label on it and stunk up the entire kitchen. NASTY.  So I'm not a fan of the smell at McKinnons.\n\nBut I am a total convert for going there to buy my meat products. I spent so little and got so much. OMG Happy Day! Fillet Mignon, Ribs, Burger, Chicken Breasts. Its just amazing. All for $41!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So between this place and farmer's markets I don't foresee myself spending any time in line at the grocery stores unless for the cat products. \n\nNow to cook these wonderfully lucious looking meats and see where the quality is.\n\nBut so far 5 STAHS!"]
["It's a meat market. It smells like meat. The meat is fresh, the meat is plentiful, the meat is dirt cheap. The place is always crowded with meat-lovers wheeling around shopping carts FILLED with meat. Where do they keep all that meat? Do these people have special meat freezers in their houses??\n\nI buy veggies here. It's not a bad veggie selection, for a meat market. I guess I'm a wierdo?\n\nThe only place that rivals this meat market is The Joshua Tree, up the street. FRAT PARTY!"]
["I cannot get here before it closes!!!\n\nMcKinnon's gets 4 stars because other than their closing time, I love them to death. I just wish they'd realize they could make more money if they'd accomodate the hours of the 9-5:30ers who work downtown or in the back bay! \n\nMy girlfriend sometimes goes there during the week and texts me with the marinated chicken choices... she's doing this often these days since it's grilling season, and I have softball games at nights and I don't have much time to eat, so she has it prepared when i get home!!\n\nIf I could yelp about my girlfriend, she'd get 5 stars!!\n\nSo... they have more meat than you could ever imagine, if you're a vegetarian, you should probably steer clear of this place... the scent of raw meat is a little overwhelming, but for the carnivore, the prices are nice and the selections are un-matched! I recommend the marinated chicken. They have terriyaki, carribean, honey mustard, garlic and onion and more!"]
["um. I don't get this place. at all. \n\nIt smells funny in here - like gross funny, and it seems so messy/dirty in here. but everyone I talk to loves this place. I think I tried some chicken here once and it was fine, but it didn't taste any better than what I bought at Whole Foods or Trader Joe's. And I like to support local businesses - when I lived in Brighton there was a great little place like that there, so I'm not against small meat/fruit shops - but I just want them to be clean looking and not smell."]
["Everything I've bought from McKinnon's has been really fresh and super tasty.  The steaks are awesome!  Thick, juicy and cheap!\n\nI try to avoid the weekends when possible because it can get really crowded in there."]
["I purchased three Delmonico steaks at McKinnon's that were well priced and grilled up nicely. Good marbling and plenty of fat around the outside. \n\nTogether with Dave's Fresh Pasta up the street, you can pick up everything you need for a great dinner within a 5 minute walk from the T."]
["McKinnons smells like a meat market which is extremely off putting at first, but  if you can clamp your nose for a minute you will find the best, freshest meat in Davis. \n\nMy only wish is that their fish selections were fresher and more varied, but if you enjoy everything from chicken to sausage to beef, this is the place to go, and I applaud their deli selections. It's always super crowded with Somerville locals and they're kind of applauding to look at, but just sidle past the waddling old people and grab your selections, but if I'm going to make a recommendation, if you're like me and just need something for dinner to feed you and your man, lay your hands on their ready to prepare meats. You'll find ready made beef Wellington, Apple Confit stuffed pork and other concoctions that are ready to pop in your stove (all you need is to make your side dish!) \n\nAlso, if you're in need of some local spices, shop local and buy Mckinnon's specialty spices like Ground Ginger, Celery, Garlic, etc."]
['McKinnon\'s can\'t be your one stop for groceries (unless you only eat meat), but is a great place to buy some meat for a BBQ or just dinner.  While its inconvenient to make multiple trips to various food stores (I usually just stick to Shaw\'s), I make an exception for McKinnon\'s.  If I am going to fire up a grill, I go here.\n\nI highly recommend the pre-marinated steak tips "original style".  Perfect for tossing on the grill with some friends in the summer.  2.5 pounds costs around $12.']
["Going to BBQ?  Live in the Davis Sq area?  McKinnons will put you on the path to a great BBQ in no time.  They have plenty of meats, some marinated, some not (Try the turkey tips!!!)  They also have some seafood, I've gotten the steamers a few times and they're always good.  And they have veggies, buns, whatever else you need\n\nSome people say it smells in there.  Some people smell in general\n\n5 stars, I'm looking forward to going back soon"]
["Wow this place is amazing. So much great meat and sooooo cheap! Their pre-marinated steak and turkey tips are amazing. the pre-seasoned roasts and pre-made stuffed chicken and pork chops are to die for. Its an easy and cheap way for a delicious dinner.\n\nIf you like to cook you can find your meat plain in all forms... did i mention it was cheap!? \n\nLOVE LOVE LOVE McKinnon's!"]
["I purchased $16 worth of marinated sirloin tips from McKinnon's a little while back, and it lasted through four meals for my boyfriend and myself.  Despite the fact that I had to do a bit of trimming in the fat department, the meat tasted great and was an incredibly good deal!  I shall return!!!"]
["McKinnon's is a great local shop for meat in Davis Square. Very fair prices (unlike Shaw's), and they carry lots of variety, including some animals and cuts I've never considered eating before. They also carry a limited selection of other items; I recall the homemade potato salad being really good, and you can buy it by the tub.\n\nIt does smell pretty strongly like a butcher shop, so if that bothers you, it's probably better not to shop there.\n\nParking is never fun in this area, and the meter maids are incredibly fast and agile here. But there are a few 15 minute loading spots in front of McKinnon's.\n\nOur church ordered 125 lbs of sliced beef short rib, and they handled it in one day at a very good price. The owner and his son handled our order themselves; its hard to find that kind of customer service these days."]
["Worth the trip!  I used to live in the area and now try to get back to Davis every Sunday to do my shopping at McKinnon's.  They have absolutely the lowest price on chicken anywhere - generally 99 cents to $1.79 per lb.  That's for split chicken breasts, boneless chicken breasts - even chicken tenderloins!    \n\nThe deal with the vegetables is to buy the ones that are plastic wrapped together and cook them within a day or two.  I'm usually able to get 4 red peppers for under $2 - so even if I don't manage to eat them all it's still a bargain!  They seem to get produce delivered weekly and drop the prices throughout the week. So the freshest produce arrives on Friday - so by Wednesday it's bargain basement, but might be more than past it's prime.\n\nCan goods, bread and other supplies are available, but expensive.  They definitely focus on meat - and for a little extra you can get chicken marinated in several different sauces or other one step dishes.\n\nCheck out their deli - great prices on turkey, ham, cheese, etc. - and think of all that money you'll save by NOT going into a supermarket every week!"]
['Best meat prices ever!  Drive 25 miles just to shop there.']
["I love this place. First and foremost because it seems like the only place in this damn city where I can get a pound of Land O' Lakes American cheese for under $6. That alone is worth going here (fresh-sliced LOL cheese is fantastic. None of that Kraft Singles crap!)\n\nIn addition to excellent cheese prices, the meat is damn good! I buy all my meat here now if at all possible, and have yet to be dissapointed. Just this evening I had some lean chicken breasts that had almost no fat on them. Made for an excellent dinner!\n\nTry to get in here before 5ish, as they close then on most days, and on the days they stay open later, the crowds are brutal."]
['This is definitely a neighborhood meat market! If I didn\'t live in Davis, I\'m not sure I would drive for the meat here. One thing for sure is you can\'t beat the prices. However, I agree with some of the other Yelpers that they need some "greener" meat - and that the cuts could be of a higher quality. Oh - and don\'t expect service; you\'re lucky if you get a greeting from the check-out clerks, but I guess that\'s not why you shop here.']
['I just recently went to this place to find some good cut of meats. Not only did i find great fresh cut meat, but GREAT prices. Seriously half the price of shaws, stop and shop or market basket, and the quality of the meat is better. This is now where i buy my meat!!']
["I make it a point to get to Davis square to visit McKinnons. They have the BEST prices on meat around. I am a big fan of their steak selection and it keeps me coming back on a regular basis. Tight location but they make effective use of the space and I've never been too cramped while buying there."]
['THIS IS WHERE I BUY MY MEAT.  I love this place.  Good meat and cheap.  They also have a small but diverse produce section.  People are friendly too. I cooked up their house style marinated steak tips to buttery goodness.']
["This little meat market where they actually sell the raw stuff can be a lifesaver for those on a budget. They carry a large assortment of beef: pot roasts, marinated tenderloins, T-bones, etc, as well as cheap-ass split chicken breast and ground-up turkey (YUMMY - both for 99-cent/lb).\n\nI would not recommend purchasing any of the vegetable unless you are desperate because they are wicked expensive (almost bought one red pepper for $3). However, definitely stop by here for your meats because it is significantly better than Shaw's right down the street in Porter.\n\nTips: get there early because they close most days at 5pm, except Thursday (6pm)."]
["Old school butchers like this don't exist much anymore.  Simple fact.  Cheap meat, good cuts."]
['Great prices, good to great meat. Great specials tho the grocery/dairy specials seem to go fast (jumbo eggs $.99 doz with nary an ovoid in sight). The main meat cooler set up is a little congested when the place is busy (which is often) and navigating people and strollers can be hazardous. The lines to check out can also spill over into the main meat area. I guess my only complaint, and it\'s probably just me, is when I think of a "butcher" shop, I think of someone prominently on hand to get you what you want if you don\'t see it, grind cuts for you, etc. I\'m constantly looking for boneless pork shoulder (or Boston Butt) but only see bone-in picnic roast. I know you can likely ring at the door and ask but no one ever seems happy when you do that. But, hey, I digress. If you want better cuts then your average super market at typically better prices, this place rocks']
["Smell disclaimer, since everyone seemingly mentions it: If you can tolerate the fish/meat market at Super 88 or the super grodyness of Haymarket, this will be way better. If you prefer the aroma and super priceyness of the Whole Foods experience, I'd say stick there.\n\nAnyways, I think this is one of the best meat markets in Boston. If money was an option, I'd shop at Savenors, but as a poor college student, this works out fine. The prices are sooo cheap and pretty decent, unlike most meat at Stop and Shop/Shaws. For example, ground chicken/turkey is like a buck a package, tenderloin is around 7 bucks a pound, their marinated pork loin/chops hover around 2.50, and boneless/skinless are usually between 1.80-2 bucks. Plus, they have random things you generally can't find at most places, like gray corned beef, slab pancetta, ground pork that isn't brined, chicken hearts, etc. Their vegetables also look a hell of a lot better than normal grocery stock and are pretty cheap as well. \n\nIt just sucks if you don't live in Cambridge/Somerville."]
["Ok. So i go to McKinnons a few times a week, it being my neighborhood grocery. I love their meat, i love their veggies, i love their prices. I think that their olives are absolutely delicious. The only thing I don't like is the smell. McKinnons has an interesting aroma. Perhaps because there's a carpet in there? Who's idea was that?\n-----------------------------------------------------\nUPDATE. So as many of you have mentioned, the carpet is no more. now sometimes the smell persists. I think its because the chop up the bodies (animal of course) in the back room. that's how you know its fresh, matey ...\n\nAnyhow, go to McKinnons for all your meat and veggies. It's fresher than anything in the supermarket and you'll be supporting a great, local business and a Davis Sq. landmark."]
["This place stinks, which isn't surprising for a meat shop. But, this kind of stink is rather nasty and is one of the reasons why I can't make myself shop there anymore. The last time I went in, I opened the door and the 'giant smell'  that took over my senses almost felt alive. Kind of like some sort of scary monster made up of meat vapors. It seriously felt like this thing could bash my head in with a rump roast if I made it angry.\n\nIts too bad that the smell puts me off though, since I love a good steak and their prices are excellent. I didn't buy a ton of red meat there, since I'm not sure where it comes from (I have a feeling that with those prices, you aren't getting organic meat.) However, the chicken was good and incredibly cheap. Also, the Cornish game hens are tasty and around $2.00 a pop.\n\nBe wary of the marinated beef options though. I got a burgundy and herb marinated steak once that looked promising. After cooking it though, I discovered that the marinade just served to cover up all of the fat. Seriously, this steak was like 70% fat and 30% meat. It was a gross fat too, more like the rubbery, thick kind that you see on the sides of a porterhouse."]
["i won't lie: offal smells awful. \n\nbut hey, such is life. throw a clothespin on your honker if you must and come here to find aisles packed with the kinds of specialty cuts of meat that elude the butcher's counters at shaw's, whole foods and so on, all at prices that stink to high heavens of great value.\n\ni'm docking it a star on account of the lackluster/lousy produce section, which really feels tacked on as an afterthought and takes up valuable real estate in what is already a cramped shop."]
["WHY is it so hard to get chicken cutlets suitable to make chicken parmesan with?   Usually the cuts are wayyy too thick.  I know I can cut them or pound them or whatever, but I'd prefer just to buy some chicken cutlets ready to bread and fry up!!!  McKinnons has them -- and they are ridiculously cheap and delicious!!!  Well worth the drive from Newton to Davis Square."]
["I finally broke down. \nI never thought I would be the type of person to cook a huge crock of crock to eat throughout the whole week (things just never turn out pretty) but I did it!!!\n\nAll thanks to McKinnon I was able to score 4 pounds of chuck roast for my Guiness beef stew for cheap: $7. That along with a bag of carrots, potatoes, and a slow cooker I created a hearty feast to stave off my hunger during this crazy busy period. With rice of course!! \n\nBesides the hulking piece of chuck roast, I also saw great deals for chicken, pork, and steak all neatly package or tied up if it is a roast (spares you from rummaging for twine and wrestling with the meat). May pre-marinated meats too. If you are the more adventurous cook, there are also innards (gizzards, hearts) and feet. \n\nAnd of course it smells!!! You're at a mini-slaughter house repackaging center, why wouldn't it? But it's totally worth it to brave your olfactory nerves for cheap meat."]
["This went from being my neighborhood butcher, to my area-ish butcher, to my every-weekend-I-make-a-specific-trip-to-Somerville butcher.  \n\nThey are always helpful and patient, which is a huge plus when it gets crowded during grillin' season.  Their everyday meats are ridiculously inexpensive, and so freaking good, that you'll scoff at the meat in Shaw's next time you walk by, and then smile sadly at all those picking through the prepackaged Styrofoam offerings all the while wondering how weird it would be to give a stranger suggestions on just where they should get their meat....yeah, weird.\n\nSeriously, try some of their marinated steak tips, and you'll know what I'm talking about."]
["I have added this to my list of places I shop for great quality and amazing price.  Marinated steak tips, wings, veal, lamb, goat, whatever you are looking for.  A small produce section which is not cheap, a full deli and a small pasta, canned foods area.  This is not super gourmet food but you don't need that every day when you can get cheap ingredients for the gourmet meal here.  They close early so don't think you can shop after 7pm!\n\nNow if I could find a fish market that is on the same scale as Mckinnon's is with meat..."]
['Cheap, quality meat and seafood.  great prices on cold cuts.']
['Good meat cheap. Lots of different cuts. I come here at least once a week to get things for dinner, you just have to get there early!\n\nWARNING!  I was in here the other day, and about to buy some things from the middle freezer thingy.  A lady came over and said, "Hey, what\'s the date on that package?"  I looked down, it was a couple weeks overdue.  She told me to double check those any time I shop there....  I don\'t ask about the other meat, because i don\'t want to know.']
["McKinnon Meat Market is a total throwback to the time before huge supermarket conglomerates when people shopped for the essentials (produce, meat, bread, etc.) at different neighborhood joints.  There are a few grocery store staples here, but it's really all about the meat, which is cheap, plentiful and diverse (today I spotted rabbit, and quail!)  Plus they often have inexpensive chicken feet, which is awesome for those of us who are trying to perfect our at home dim sum game.\n\nAnd yes, the store smells quite meaty, but that's part of the charm, along with the mix of customers, which is a cross section of Somerville--very old and new Davis Square.  Seeing the hipsters and the old-school residents reluctantly navigate around each other is always good for a laugh."]
['Incredibly cheap, fresh meat and produce. \n\nMarinated meats at a very low price that can last a few meals. Full lunch meat deli with really good/cheap chicken salad. \n\nOnly negative comment that can be made is that it kiiinda smells.']
["I love the feel of the store.It's great to have in the neighborhood and The selection of parmzan and romano is wonderful at awonderful price"]
['I absolutely love this place.  The people are extremely friendly, the meat is amazing quality, and best of all...it is rediculously cheap!  How could you ask for more!!!']
["You could walk right past this place if you're not careful.  As you step into this no-frills butchery, don't let the smell deter you, wade right in.  You'll find the best prices on meat in the Boston area.  From their wide variety of cuts to their wonderful pre-made meals, they've cornered the meat market in Somerville.  \n\nWith bread bakeries, fresh pasta, and McKinnon's, who needs to leave Davis?"]
["Good priced meats! Lots of choices and lots of cuts. I don't really like their marinated meats since I purchased a couple and didn't really find much flavor to them. I also did not enjoy the lamb that I purchased - maybe I didn't cook it correctly but it tasted really gamy to me. Other than that, everything else that I have purchased has been great - chicken gizzards, chicken drumsticks, steak tips, etc. Looking for a special cut of meat? They probably have it. Just call and ask."]
["McKinnon's IS meat.\n\nIt has everything an omnivore--even the most adventurous--could ever want, at prices far below what you'll find at the supermarket. They also have a small greengrocer section, so you could conceivably pick up all the fresh ingredients for a simple meal.\n\nNot to mention that, thanks to the deli guy, I now know how to broil a beautiful steak. Thanks, McKinnon's, and see you soon!\n\nP.S. My neighbor tells me that if you need something special, just walk into the back. Can't say I've needed anything special so far, though."]
['I have lived in Davis Square since 2002.  Although I am a devoted McKinnon\'s shopper, I have resisted writing a review for a while.  (What can I possibly add to the ~100 reviews that came before me?)\n\nBut I can\'t resist any longer.  When I went there today and saw veal bones for $2.00 / lb and beautiful 8" beef marrow bones for $1.50 / lb that they would cut to order, that tipped the scales.  I don\'t make a tremendous amount of veal stock, but when you need it you need it.  It\'s not the sort of thing I ever thought can be done so inexpensively.\n\nOkay, so the rest of the place:  great and varied selection, the place smells a little funky but the product is good, etc.  Unbelievably cheap, and meat quality and selection rivals any other store I\'ve seen.  Note also that they will order specialty meats on request.  Need a suckling pig or a baby goat?  Done.\n\nThat said, there are a few drawbacks preventing them earning five stars.  Nothing is organic / free range / etc.  If that\'s an issue for you, then McKinnon\'s has nothing for you.  Also, avoid the fish.  Vegetables are hit and miss.\n\nNote also that the place gets REALLY backed up during busy periods, like around 5:00.  If you can, go there during off hours.']
['i don\'t buy meat at shaw\'s.  why should i? it\'s expensive as hell, even when it\'s on sale.  mckinnons has everything! meat with sauce, meat without sauce, big packages, small packages.  sure their produce isn\'t perfect, but why would you buy produce at a place with "meat market" in the name?! i mean, honestly.\n\nif i had a bigger freezer, it would be full of meat.  as long as there would also be room for tater tots and ben&amp;jerry\'s.  :)']
['Marinated Turkey tips - enough for 5 meals for under $5.  AND crazy delicious!\n\nThis place may be the reason I continue renting my over priced apt in Davis Square!']
["There really isn't much reason for me to buy meat anywhere else than here....prices are most competitive around and they have everything.  You aren't going to find free range, grass fed anything here....so beware!!!  The produce prices aren't that great.  Deli meats are ok...just go for the meat and some of their seafood is priced decent.\n\nThey close at 6pm everyday but Thursday...so get there early and they only accept credit/debit over $10."]
['I LOVE McKinnons, I do, but the one here in Somerville, is just aweful. I know the meat here is cheap, but its also poor quality compared to the other locations, Everett, Danvers, and my favorite Salem, New Hampshire. I avoid this location at all costs, the beef is always turning and the chicken isnt as pink as I like it, plus it smells, and the butchers are always outside in thier aprons no less smoking. GROSS.']
['Always a fan of red meat... \n\nThat being said, this place is red meat heaven.  There is no-place cheaper for red meat.  Forget the produce, ditch the seafood that is offered there, and go straight to the racks of red meat + chicken + pork. \n\nWide variety as well... from pinwheels to steak tips to a gorgeous selection of ribs.  Chicken lovers will love the prices on the fowl.   \n\nThe deli is pretty great too, and you\'ll find amazing deals on prosciutto that can\'t be beaten anywhere in Boston.  Also, the staff has a ton of local color, and the place is completely, old-school, straight-up  "this is a butcher shop, line up for the meat, and nothing is organic".   \n\nDon\'t bother with the produce, and I love the fact that EVERYTHING (and I mean everything) is packaged like it\'s meat.  Want some shallots?  Packaged in a meat backing-board in clear plastic wrap and marked "SHALLOTS".  Just FYI, don\'t buy your shallots here.  \n\nMinus one star for the produce, but, honestly, you didn\'t come here for produce.']
["A true gem. My favorite. Amazingly reasonable prices, especially when you go around the corner to get ripped off at the grocery store. Nothing compares to McKinnon's!"]
['This is a solid 4 star "Meat Market", and I\'m being very particular on my definition of meat here. Fish and Produce are not meat, so if that\'s what you are looking for, go to a produce market or a fish market, but stop giving bad reviews when you don\'t even try their marinated steak tips, sausage, or cuts of beef.\n\nSeriously folks, this is the place to come to pick up your meat for a BBQ. Loads of ground chuck for hand-packed hamburgers, Bags of chicken parts for grilling, and lamb-tips (mmm, lamb at a fraction of the cost).']
['a old fashion store with great prices']
['I have to say to all those writing reviews about the odor -- get over it.  I\'ve been in this store dozens of times and rarely have I detected a major odor other than FRESH raw meat.  (Contrary to many people\'s assertions, who probably have never been in another meat market in their lives, this is not the odor of rotten meat; it if were, you\'d probably be throwing up.)  \n\nBut here\'s news for you: that\'s what a "meat market" smells like.  If you\'ve only ever bought meat at giant supermarkets -- which is usually not very fresh and wrapped up to make it look better than it really is -- you don\'t understand.  Go to a farmers market sometime that has a real meat market.  (Not a hippie or yuppie farmers market -- a traditional one.)  Heck, go to a small town in Europe, or even a market in a large Italian city, and you\'ll find meat markets selling the freshest high-quality meats that smell a LOT worse than McKinnon\'s.  Dead animals have an odor -- it\'s that simple.  If you are buying meat in a place without any noticeable odor, chances are that meat isn\'t fresh, and it certainly isn\'t freshly packaged.  (The fresh meat itself shouldn\'t have an odor, but odors do happen in butchering; no odor means either the meat was previously frozen or it was probably already packaged in plastic somewhere far away.)\n\nThe fresh meat at McKinnon\'s is generally very fresh.  That\'s what you go to a meat market for.  Sorry for all those reviewers who have encountered bad or overpriced vegetables, etc., but that\'s not what McKinnon\'s "Meat Market" is about.  If you want a supermarket that has everything, go to a supermarket.  I agree that the produce could be better, but they don\'t have a lot of turnaround because it\'s a MEAT MARKET.\n\nAnyhow, stuff here is generally amazing and incredibly inexpensive.  The quality is very good -- not the absolute highest quality of meat, but generally better than you\'d find in most supermarkets (often for HALF the price -- literally).  Even the unusual items are surprisingly good quality.  For example, I bought a package of chicken hearts for a special recipe a couple months ago (very cheap!), and they were very high quality.  You can tell a lot about how chickens live and are slaughtered by the quality of the heart, and let me assure you that whatever McKinnon\'s does with its chickens at least, they are treated properly.  Not free-range organic, etc., but better than most factory farm animals you see ground up for your supermarket display case.\n\nThis isn\'t a traditional butcher shop (though I know people who have had good experiences asking for an unusual cut, which they often will do in the back), but it isn\'t a supermarket either.  If you want fresh meat conveniently packaged, it\'s a great place to shop.  Huge variety too.  You could keep yourself occupied for a year just trying different dishes with the wide variety of cuts of meat and various animal parts here.']
["I love this place, and couldn't live without it. The meat is extremely well priced. The only place I can ever find any meat cheaper is at the commissary at Hanscomb. But they don't have the selection that McKinnon's has! McK's also has good quality meat. No, it's not what you'll get from Savenor's, but it's certainly the equal of a good grocery store's meat department, at a fraction of the price. I use this place to stock my freezer, to help me host cookouts, and to just throw together dinner on a random night.\n\nAs some people have said, yeah, the place doesn't smell too good. But I can tell you from long experience that it's not because the meat is rotting in the cases. Everything I've bought from them has always been perfectly good quality, with no signs of spoilage (and I know when I see, smell, or taste spoiled meat).\n\nThe veggies aren't fantastically priced, true, but when you have nothing in the fridge, the fact that the veggies are there can allow you to just make one stop on your way home and get everything you need for a full meal. Very handy.\n\nI've heard people say that if you talk to the owner, they'll give you whatever cut of meat you want. I would like to try this at some point, maybe get myself a whole beef tenderloin or even some lamb tenderloins, which I never see anywhere I can afford them!"]
['Ive always had good luck going here, but you need to be careful sometimes.  Ive seen cuts or packaging that I would never want to take home, but on the whole, its a great value place']
["I've been going for Mckinnon's for years and love this place. The meat and deli prices are unbeatable and good quality. The produce prices are a bit high but then again I don't go for the produce. My only mild complaint is that this place can get crowded but what can you expect for such great deals."]
["The best prices on meat around, with excellent friendly service, a full deli, and even a small produce section so you don't need to make another trip to complete the meal. How something this practical and good continues to exist in Davis Square against the odds is beyond me."]
["An easy 5 stars for this one. I've been shopping here for the last 2 years or so. The prices and quality are unsurpassed. Beautifully cut filet mignon is $7 a pound!!! It's the only steak that I ever eat at home. I love meat and I love to cook (sorry PETA) and this is THE best place around to buy quality meats of all sorts and the deli is wonderful as well. Produce section is small, as is the store, but excellent just the same. It gives me a reason to go to Davis sq. a couple of times a month."]
["I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Its no-frills but the meat is SO MUCH better than what you would get at a supermarket, and for RIDICULOUSLY cheap prices!  I read online that many of the area's restaurants get their meat here, and I believe it...it is a noticeable difference in quality when I cook, I can't eat the meat from anywhere else, now! :-D"]
['I love this place! If you love meat so much that you would eat people if it was legal, then this is a great little meat shop in the heart of Davis Square. They have great prices, a great selection, and incredible tasting meat. They also have a good selection of fish, chicken, and pork.  I was looking for a specific type of sirloin and an employee told me all about the cut. It was great. They also have some very fresh vegetables, if your not down with chewing on living things. The only con about McKinnons is they do not have great hours during the week, they close at 6 or 7pm depending on the day.  I had to leave work early to get my meat, but it was oh so worth it! Go meat!']
["why you should go to mckinnons:\n\n1) You need chicken, pork or beef bones to make some stock. Home-made stock is a lost art, and thanks to these guys, one I've happily rediscovered.\n\n2) You're grilling with some friends, but you don't have time to prepare. Go to McKinnons, buy some of the marinated steak tips, lamb shoulder chops and Chinese sausages and you're friends will think very highly of you. Add some sides from the deli and some Miller High Life from downtown wine and liquor on the way home and you'll be a hero in the true sense of the word.\n\n3) You need a weird cut that's not usually available or you need an entire rack of pork chops and you've thought about this ahead of time. Go talk to the guys in the back - they'll take care of you.\n\n4) You want rabbit for dinner. I defy you to show me a place that sells rabbits for less.\n\n5) You want to walk into a place that smells like deep fried monkey poo on a stick. Seriously can't they do something about this. It's horrible!!!!!!!"]
['The prices here are incredible and given that they focus almost exclusively on meat, the selection is quite good.  Definitely a good place to stock up prior to those summer barbeques!']
["Good (raw) meat cheap! They also have a number of items you can just throw in your oven and have a semi-fancy cooked meal. The prices are unbeatable: some of their items aren't just less than Shaw's, they're priced below Costco or H-Mart, and in much smaller packages."]
['Top notch meat market with great cuts of meat and great prices. You can get filet mignon for less than $8/pound. Their marinated chicken breasts are excellent as well! Highly recommended!']
["It's small, and yes it does smell a little funny (what did you expect?) -- but it's good, quality meat for less than you would pay at the grocery store. Plus, you can get some weird stuff that you don't usually see at your local Shaw's or Trader Joe."]
["What a great little find!  Thanks to Yelp I headed down there this afternoon and picked up a couple pounds of boneless chicken breasts, box of bacon, some ham slices, sack of red potatoes and an onion for $16!  Place was clean, didn't smell nearly as bad as I thought a butcher's shop would, and there were carts available if you were going to buy in bulk."]
['meat good!  vegetarians be warned!  do not enter.']
["i just want to add a few comments! \n1. If you have to BBQ and you don't want to spend a lot on cooking for many people come here\n2. They have ginger\n3. They take credit card but there is a limit, maybe 10 dollars?\n4. Don't go on Saturday. You will leave without a small pinky-toe (Thanks a lot lady with a shopping cart in the smallest store ever!)\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you are looking on a good deal for meat and grocery, McKinnon's is the spot. It is conveniently located by the red line, in the heart of Davis square. I find that if I am in a pinch I can always count on McKinnon's to have that ingredient I forgot to pick up. For all those people who sat it smells, thats because that's the smell of a butcher shop! The only reason you don't smell that at other grocery stores is that they are huge. Great to have a butcher so close to home!"]
["Back in the day, my vegan girlfriend would have dumped me on the spot for patronizing this place. But alas, my carnivorous ways defeated my tolerance for all things tofu, and lead me into McKinnon's embrace. McKinnon's has quality USDA choice beef at some of the best prices I've seen. For example, I've purchased choice steaks, such as sirloin, delmonico, fillet mignon, and steak tips for around $3 - $5 per pound. I've purchased choice rib roasts for as little as $4.99 per pound. The pork and chicken sausages are always delicious and affordable. For poultry, you can find chicken, turkey, duck, quail, and possibly other feathered beasts that I can't recall at the moment. Pork selections include all the usual items, such as loins, chops, ribs, as well as more unusual parts such as trotters and heads. You can also expect to find both domestic and imported lamb in all the typical cuts. Essentially, McKinnon's is a great neighborhood butcher that has (or will get) any meat product you can think of. I will admit that the seafood can be hit or miss. I've purchased great flounder, but terrible scallops. Don't overlook the deli! They stock great deli meats and cheeses at exceptional prices. Also, fresh breads and rolls arrive daily from the Winter Hill Bakery. Occasionally, you'll find odd items at ridiculously cheap prices, such as 10 lb. bags of King Arthur Flour for $3. My advice would be to purchase your vegetables and seafood elsewhere, but definitely purchase your meats and deli items at McKinnons."]
["Best prices I've seen, in or out of the city, on meat, fresh produce, and cold-cuts.  Just watch out for soccer mom's in a rush, they'll knock you out for the last package of spare ribs."]
['I try to go once a week, some of the weekly special are ridicolous.  There is nothing like there marinated tips either texas or house on a summer grill.  deli meat is good and super cheap.  You can have quality meat and lots and lots of it for little money.  you really cant go wrong.  the only down side is its crowded and can smell pretty gross in the summer and the lines can get confusing since its so small and the line will roll down into the isles but its no doubt about it worth it.  I just bought seafood there for the first time but have yet to cook it.']
["If you ever need any type of meat, go here! They have an amazing selection featuring parts of animals I never even knew were edible. They also have chicken and beef that has already been seasoned/marinated. The prices are fantastic and the quality is excellent. They are always well stocked. I can be in and out of this place with pounds of meet in under 15 minutes - that's the best part!"]
["This is the way a butcher shop should be. It SMELLS like a butcher shop, not some overly sanitized you can't smell the food western market. A butcher shop should SMELL LIKE MEAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Great prices, half or less than shaw's, 1/3rd or less than Whole Foods. Good meat at great prices from a real butcher!"]
['My whole family buys our meats at McKinnons. They have the freshest meats I have found in a long, long time. I will not buy anywhere else as I am spoiled. Their flyer comes out weekly on friday online and I always look forward to it, you never know what they are going to have on sale. My favorite thing there is the steak tips which go on sale about once a month. If you shop there regularly you can get the best deals as everything goes on sale on different weeks. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great meats at a great price.']
["Don't go for produce.  It's pretty much an afterthought.  This place is for meat.  The best thing is: if they don't have it, you can ask, and chances are you can pick it up tomorrow.  We ordered a lamb shoulder that way -- they hadn't cut it yet when we went and asked on Friday; it was ready for us to pick up Saturday morning.  We stuck it on a spit and roasted it for 2 hours with nothing but olive oil, lemon, salt, and oregano....heaven...."]
["I have to be honest. The meat is high quality. Cheap as Hell, but the place scares the living hell out of me.  I can't put my finger on it."]
["Called last week to see if McKinnon's carries Spanish-style Chorizo sausages and was told that it would arrive this Wednesday.  Called today and the guy I talked to did not even know what chorizo is...  Thought there might be some sort of miscommunication, so I had my husband call to ask... again, did not even know what chorizo is.  Don't think we are going back there again..."]
["I love this place because the meat is cheap, and it's all very no-frills. You're in, you're out, and you usually leave with a bag full of bargains. Skip the fish-- it doesn't always smell fresh."]
["this place has some tasty meats and is well priced. few nights ago, we bought marinated pork stuffed with raisins and apples. we broiled them (with a tinfoil cover on) for half an hour or so, and when they came out of the oven, they were absolutely delectable. we've had good steak and rotisserie chicken from mckinnon's. just don't walk past their parking lot, because it reeks of rancid meat."]
["McKinnon's is easily one of Davis Square's treasures. The prices are, as many of said, excellent, the food is well prepared, and the people are incredibly helpful and nice. Older reviews mention the smell, but I didn't notice anything that I didn't expect in a butcher's; it smelled like meat, but it was not *bad*, so I suspect they have fixed that a little since the 2006 reviews that mention the smell.\n\nThe prices are still really fabulous; the first time I went there I had to keep myself from spending $15 on a week's worth of meat because they were blowing me out of the water, costwise! Now I'm better at buying just what I need for a couple of days, and returning repeatedly - it's well worth the trip.\n\n(next month, I'm having a bacon party, and they'll be my Prime Source! So many choices!)"]
['Meat Glorious MEAT!!!!\n\nThis place has it all!!! Anything that was ever a part of a land animal and even some swimming and flying animals too!  Absolutely amazing.  The Prices and selection ROCK!']
['Great prices. Good selection. Great location. Its great for what it is a great small meat market in the center of busy Davis Square. Definitely check it out!']
["i love mckinnon's marinated meat!! oh good, my mouth is watering just thinking of some nice charcoal grilled marinated steak tips!!!"]
["The best.  Their filet mignon is outstanding, and less than half what you'd pay at the seediest grocery store.  Chicken is unbeatable - less than $2 a pound for not only great quality cut chicken breast, but also for tenderloins!  And you wouldn't believe the variety.  They have everything from rabbit to venison to tripe to king crab legs to produce and cheese.  Oh, and I almost forgot the marinated steak tips!  The marinades sometimes vary, but don't miss the house marinated tips."]
["I do not understand the adulation this place recieves.  When I moved to da 'ville, I was so excited to find a local butcher shop --but this place is terrible.  I bought a leg of lamb and some shanks for passover last year, and while the leg of lamb was ok, the lamb shanks were bad.  And I don''t mean slightly off, I mean, run out of the kitchen gagging kinda off.  I guess thats what can happen when you buy your meat prepackaged."]
["As an FYI this market is NOT the same McKinnon's that's in Danvers and Everett.  Same name, different ownership."]
["Wonderfully low-priced meats and produce, with several marinated meats and lots of specials. It's good quality, not great quality, but certainly excellent value for price. My only issue with them is that they're not open very late (I think they close at 5:30 or 6), so it's hard to swing by after work. It's a perfect place to stock up on a nice selection for a BBQ.... They have fish, but it's never looked great to me, so I haven't tried it...."]
['Great place. Very accessible, right in Davis Square. The quality of the meat is excellent. I got some Chinese pork tips, BBQ wings, chicken breast, and beef chuck stew. All quality stuff. The meats are laid out and arranged nicely, pretty easy to find things. Yes, it does smell funny but it seems pretty clean in there. All in all, worth the trip! Stock up!']

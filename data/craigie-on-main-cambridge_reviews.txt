["Didn't know what to expect because we would walk by and on the exterior, it didn't look like much. That said, the experience once you enter the doors is very different. Before I get to that- let me tell you about the before visit experience. \n\nWe have heard the burger is pretty legit, so we finally made a reservation for one day after work at 5:45p. When they called yo confirm the reservation I was specifically asked if we were planning to have the burger. I said yes. I was then told I should change the reservation to 5:30, and get there early because it sells out. I was in shock but we obliged. Thankfully, on the day of our reservation, my husband got there just after 5p. \n\nI also arrived before they opened - but we were the first people in line because he got there when he did. People came up and counted and would stay or go. At 5:30, they opened. They reserve burgers as you walk to your table even. So needless to say, sold out in 5 minutes. At 21.00 each - or was it 22 - that's quite impressive. Some people just aren't willing to pay that for a burger.  We aren't those people though.\n\nThe burger was simple yet delish - and those potato wedges that came with it - to die for (I consider myself a fried potato enthusiast). The asparagus a la plancha and octopus were also legit. The drinks were great, as was the service. We will be back. Such a great experience."]
["I had heard great things about Craigie for a long time! Finally got to see what all the hype is about! Firstly, don't bother going if you're really hungry or suffer from sticker shock. If you have moderate hunger and a nice bank account, then you can't beat the high quality, tasty bites (and I specifically chose the word bites here). \n\nIt ended up being $85 per person with tip but half of us wanted to stop somewhere and get more food on the way home. I mean, I appreciate right-sized portions, but this is like one of those times where you want to look around and see if you're on some kind of hidden camera show (e.g. Punk'd, Candid Camera). \n\nWe did a the 4 course menu. You can pick 4 or 6 and it's chef's choice, they'll just check if you have special requirements so it will be appropriate. If you're vegan, don't even bother... you pay just as much but will end up with very expensive salads, or a charred branch of broccoli (with nothing else). They'll be delicious, but you'll get the least value.\n\nThis is the kind of place I'd go if the boss is taking me out to lunch and expensing it :-)"]
["I've wanted to come eat here for years and have been looking forward to this so long which made it a bigger disappointment. This review is from a few months ago as I didn't want to write this one angry. Here is a breakdown course by course.\n\n Sat at chef's counter so I could see the kitchen, relatively clean and everyone seemed super focused.\n\nAmuse:\nA piece of toast with shaved pork fat/lardo, tasty \n\n1st course\nScallop crudo with I believe blood orange, opal basil &amp; hearts of palm\nNo salt present, really bland. I asked my server for salt but it didn't come in time so just ate it as is.\n\n2nd course\nVandouvan Mussels\nGood, flavorful, broth had balanced spice and richness. Enjoyed it.\n\n3rd\n$20 Supplement each\nBone in fish course\n I paid $20 extra for an ounce of meat on a fish head. Difficult to eat and tasted entirely of vinegar. Not balanced a let down.\n\n4th\nPasta with prosciutto and caviar\nPasta wasn't al dente it was straight up raw. Like ridiculously hard. Caviar in butter is always good but just wish my pasta was cooked another minute or two.\n\n5th\n$20 Supplement course\nBraised Veal Breast, mushrooms, herb puree, jus\nBest dish of the night. Seriously good plate of food. Why can't everything here be this good?\n\n6th\nTenderloin, Fork smashed Parsnip, Jus, (Shallot?)\nNothing special, I thought this place was all about butcher cuts and flavor or trend? Jus as you can see in photo had consistency of water and flavor to match.\n\n7th\nButtermilk panna cotta\nGood texture, nothing crazy though\n\n8th\nChocolate cremeux, ice cream, feuilletine \nOverall an okay ending to the meal.\n\n I walked away spending over $300 on dinner for two with supplements. There are numerous other places in town I could have spent less, had a 3 course dinner and everything would have been good. I didn't walk in here expecting Daniel or anything, just a good meal and was completely disappointed.\n Several course needed salt desperately and I asked for a container from my server after the first course but then he took it away again. I asked for salt and had it taken away 3 times. After the second time just leave the thing on the table.\n I also left hungry. A tasting menu is small courses yes but you should be full by the end. I was hungry enough I asked if I could buy a bag of bread to eat in the car on the drive home, after waiting 20 minutes and asking a second time I gave up and left. Went to the grocery store and bought a rotisserie cooked chicken to eat."]
['My husband and i came here for the highly spoken about burger. Made a reservation for the bar for 530. As soon as we got there we were seated and our burgers were reserved for us. The service was amazing. People were waiting on us hand and foot making sure we had enough to drink and making sure we enjoyed the food. \n\nThe burger was good, not the best ive ever had, esp not for the price. We both got bacon on it too which cost extra. The burger meat was soft and cooked perfectly. The consistency of the burger is what i wasnt a huge fan of, its a little too creamy for me if that makes any sense. But the steak fries were amazing!! \n\nOverall very impressed with the service. But the burger isnt worth all the hype.']
["The burger was so good, and at $22 per burger, it was a steal! \n\nConsidering you would have to pay almost $15 for a Shake Shack burger that came with fries and drink, the $22 Craigie on Main burger with half lbs of beef + bacon + potato wedges + salad + sides of slaw + pickles felt cheap. Just let that sink in.\n\nBesides the quantity, the quality of the burger was superb! The beef patty I ordered was medium rare, and the meat juice literally oozed out after one bite. So good! I couldn't taste much of the bone marrow flavor though, but the patty was definitely very juicy and a little buttery.\n\nJust FYI, they only served 18 of the secret burgers per night, and the beef they served was from a single handpicked farm where the cows were grass-fed. The beef was then grounded together with bone marrow to make the beef patty even more buttery.\n\nMy friend had been raving about this place and only on this occasion did I have a chance to visit this restaurant. I didn't have a lot of chances so i made sure to come early at 4:45 PM. I was of course the first person. The second person got there at 5PM, but we were the only 2 who came before they opened.\n\nAnyways, we were seated at the bar and the bartender asked us for our choice of cocktailx. I told him I liked something smooth and not rum-based. Therefore, he served me the Jungle Bird cocktail, but sub rum with Gin. The drink was really good! Exactly how I would like a cocktail - and I had already tried a lot of popular cocktails bar in NYC such as PDT, Angel's Share, Apotheke or Raines.\n\nBack to the burger, the beef patty size was really generous. It was half-pound. I only wished the outside was more seared. The potato wedges were also perfect. The outside was well flavored, and crispy, while the inside was not too overcooked. The salad/pickles/slaw were good too.\n\nIt was one of the best burgers I've had. Just not a run away winner yet."]
["Came here for the first time for our anniversary, and the night was executed pretty flawlessly (especially the impeccable service!). We were greeted by 2 glasses of champagne and a congratulatory note, and whisked into a memorable 3 course meal.\n\nTheir beginning bread basket was tasty, although cold (would have expected warm freshly baked bread here, but I guess not?). We accidentally received 2 of each of the amuse bouches, but happily ate both as they were excellent bites (bluefish spread and a duck choriso).\n\nTo start, I had the fried clams with squid ink anchioade, and they were so tender and fresh without a whif of grit, and the anchioade added a flavorful touch. The clams were coated in a thick cornmeal coating, and to be fair, I personally usually prefer a thinner crust- but it was excellent for what it was. The hubby's squid app was also top notch.\n\nFor main, we both got the pork 3 ways (no way we were gonna share) and it was pretty fantastic... shoulder, rib, and belly, all prepared utterly perfectly and accompanied with the most lovely and flavorful accompaniments (tender white asparagus, grapes, jus). They ain't joking when they say Craigie knows how to do protein- this was lick-your-plate delicious, and I'd come back again and again for this dish (or really, any other protein). Note though- it was pretty rich (as French-ish food tends to be).\n\nFor dessert, I had something with lime curd, and the husband had something with chocolate, and both were pretty to look at and a great and tasty way to end the meal. Cocktails were excellent, wine list is solid, beer list had some decent options (although pricey). \n\nOverall, we had an excellent meal here, and really appreciated the nice anniversary touches. If you're looking for a nice celebratory French-inspired meal and are looking for a fantastic piece of protein, Craigie's your spot."]
["My husband and I came here after a chef friend recommended it for our trip to Boston. We decided to go for the tasting menu, because we literally eat everything and want to sample what the chef wants to show us. We happened to dine here during the week of Passover, so the menu had nods to traditional Jewish (specifically Passover) dishes.\n\nAmuse Bouche: it was interesting that we each got a different one. I had a teeny tiny bite of whitefish atop a sliver of a radish, while hubby had chicken liver on a piece of celery. Both were tasty. \n\nFirst Course: Smoked sablefish (black cod) with sumac and blood oranges. This was light and refreshing with obviously, a yummy smoke to it.\n\nSecond Course: Asparagus with poached egg, mushroom, and a delicious mushroom sauce. This was SO good. The asparagus was cooked perfectly - still a bit of a crunch. The mushrooms were the perfect complement and the egg on top just brought it all together. \n\nThird Course: the most amazing matzoh ball soup I have ever had (sorry, Grandma). I loved that the carrots and onions were diced really small so I had a bite of everything in each spoonful. The matzoh ball itself was perfect - firm so it did not crumble apart into the soup - with a lot of flavor. Well done. This may have been my favorite course of the night, honestly.\n\nFourth course: At this point I was a little full, but I can't say no to brisket. It was served with broccoli rabe that was nice and crisp (I'd imagine they flash fried it?), and had a black currant jus. Perhaps it was because I was already full, but I didn't enjoy this one as much as the soup. The meat was cooked well, but maybe there was too much black currant on it for my taste. \n\nIntermezzo: Panna cotta with apricot coulis and fennel pollen. This was awesome. But they served it in a square shot glass, with a normal size spoon. It's only a few bites worth, but so much was wasted in the corners of the glass. Give me a tiny spoon! Or put it in a more practical serving dish/glass.\n\nDessert: Again, we received two different things. Hubby received a creme caramel (like a flan) with a sesame cracker. It looked like it was only haif of the normal round shape. I preferred mine: arroz con leche with a shortbread cookie on top, and an amazing mango turmeric sorbet on top of that. It was incredible.\n\nAfter coffee, they brought us yet ANOTHER dessert-like treat, which I think they may give to everyone. Served in tiny espresso cups, I don't remember what it was, but it tasted like a vanilla milkshake with citrus.\n\nService was great; our waiter Phil was attentive and fun and took the time to get to know us and chat with us a bit. Cocktails were excellent as well. Craigie is definitely a spot to hit up if you're a foodie. I've seen people commenting on the burgers here, but idk... do the chef tasting, you know you're gonna get a good meal with that."]
['Surprised by the open spot on a busy night, I brought a group here for a grad dinner. The tasting menu was well done and moderately priced. It does not have a really classy ambiance, and you would fit in wearing anything from jeans to a dress. They also customize your dishes based on what you like and dislike, and the wine selection is very nice. I would highly recommend this for a celebratory meal!']
["Burger and a Notch Beer Friday Lunch Pairing Review:\n\nI am a long time fan of Cragie on Main and often extol their amazing food. I have eaten there several times and always enjoy the chance to have one of their amazing burgers. I recently signed up with a friend for their burger and a beer Friday lunch promotion with Notch brewing, so this is a review of that, not the restaurant in general.\n\nFood (9 out of 10): As usual the burger doesn't disappoint. It's has an amazing velvety texture and a great balance with the sauce and bun.\n\nDrink (7 out of 10): As this was a beer pairing, we tried the Notch brewing. The beer is quite tasty, though the wait staff served the beer directly to the table in the can which was a bit strange and only provided a glass once asked....and it was the wrong type of glass at that. I know this might seem like a small thing, but proper glassware and the aroma of a beer help enhance the flavor.\n\nAtmosphere (8 out of 10): We sat off to the side and the place was packed by the time we left.\n\nCost (6 out of 10): Craigie needs to clarify this promotion as their advertised $18 burger and notch beer promotion, in actuality, provides no special deal -the burger is regularly $18 and doesn't include a beer. In fact, you are at a bit of a disadvantage as the online ticketing charges a service fee. \n\nService (6 out of 10): Sadly, this is where things weren't so great and left us with a sour experience. Our waitress was distant and dismissive and, in truth, a bit rude when we asked how the burgers were cooked as my friend didn't want her burger served medium-rare. The waitress never asked and was a bit rude with her manner. We also had some sticking points as mentioned above with the beer delivery.\n\nOverall, the burger and beer lunch pairing is a great idea to try a delicious burger; there are a few kinks that need to be worked out if Craigie plans on doing it again."]
['It was a dark and stormy night... literally. Saturday was a snowstorm keeping most people inside and bundled up warm. So what does Craigie on Main do? They decide to have a Chef\'s Whim night! \n\nI\'ve been a Boston foodie for quite a while now. The sad truth is, Craigie on Main (CoM) has escaped me for my entire 20-year Boston run. Why? Becuase everyone else has already been, and when it comes time to picking a "fun, hip new place" to try, CoM always gets bumped off the list. But never from MY list!\n\nFinally, the perfect storm (pun intended) - Chef\'s Whim at CoM is different, and in this case, different is good! The drive took twice as long, but worth it. Parking was available because no one would be foolish enough to be driving and/or parking in Cambridge tonight... except for this fool. Okay, so perhaps not? Plenty of other "fools" packed the establishment for what was a pescatarian\'s dream dinner come true for a chef\'s choice. The restaurant was bustling with great servers and happy, laughing patrons. The perfect idea for this dark and stormy night, indeed!\n\nOysters? yup. Clams? yup. Salmon? yup. Hake? yup. Okay, so they also threw a chicken plate in near the end of the 6-course run. And two desserts, to boot.\n\nI have not one complaint or issue with ANY of it. CoM is definitively a Boston (Cambridge) jewel, a go-to, a beacon of brilliance, and enjoyment with every bite. There\'s a very good reason chef Tony Maws is regularly praised by the James Beard Foundation and receiving its award.\n\nOh, and the cocktails rocked my socks, as well. \n\nI can finally check this outstanding establishment off my bucket list. AND... now it needs to be added to my "must return" list! I see a renowned Craigie on Main burger in my future!']
['Determined to order the secret burger, my family and I arrived at Craigie on Main half an hour before opening time. They only make 18 of these bad boys each night, so we made sure to snag one right away. I find it hilarious how we suddenly become so punctual when it comes to food. Gotta love it!\n\n// Secret Burger ($19 + $3 fried egg + $3 bacon) - 4 stars\nEight ounces of grass-fed beef patty with bone marrow blended in for some extra fat. I didn\'t think it was out-of -this-world delicious, but it certainly was very juicy. The extra egg and bacon weren\'t necessary.\n\n// Vermont Pork Three Ways: Roasted Shoulder, Slow-Cooked Belly, and Spice-Crusted Rib ($35) - 4 stars\nQuite expensive for the amount you get. The fattiness of the pork was balanced out by the variety of condiments: apple purée, radishes, whole grain mustard, and broccoli rabe.\n\n// Confit and Roasted Milk-Fed Pig\'s Head (For Two People) ($70) - 5 stars\nThis reminded me of authentic "lechon" back home, although this version is eaten Peking duck style. Order it ASAP since it takes 45 minutes to prepare. Be warned, though, that the pig head might make some feel a bit queasy. \n\n// Roasted Sweet Potatoes ($10) - 5 stars\nTopped with crunchy hazelnuts and flavored with Moroccan spices. Definitely give this side dish a shot, especially if you like sweet potatoes.']
['Came on Sunday night after learning about their "Chef\'s Whim" event they have every week. After 8pm on Sundays, you can opt for a 4-course or 6-course menu where the chefs will make something innovative that\'s not on their regular menu. This is a great way to try something new at a discounted price!\n\nHostesses were friendly, our waiter was quiet, but very polite and attentive. To be honest, because the items weren\'t on the menu, I don\'t remember the names of everything I ate because once they\'re served, the waitstaff will explain each plate and everything that\'s in them. No complaints on anything we had though! And we\'re given a note page to doodle, add reviews, and basically put our thoughts on paper on which dishes we like, what could be improved, and what we\'d love to see again.\n\nLoved this event, and would love to come again to try the regular menu!']
["I seem to be going against general consensus in this review, but after a visit for the 4-course Chef's Whim, I won't be rushing back anytime soon. Service was fine, my drink (the penicillin) was superb, but I was not as enthralled by the meal as the other reviewers who came for the Whim. Beef heart pastrami with horseradish, tomato salad with tahini dressing and Marcona almonds, fried Essex clams (excellent!), chicken with eggplant and shishito peppers, and milk chocolate cremeux. Knowing that they produce exquisite dishes (thank you, Instagram), the chicken dish was a bit of a letdown. I do plan to go back for the burger though!"]
["Cozy warm with friendly fun servers. The food is inventive and expensive and worth it\nWe did the tasting menu and while I couldn't name any of the dishes Incan attest I loved them all.\n\nThe main course was a duck breast and duck sausage with huckleberries and other stuff.\n\nAll in all a very good experience."]
["Okay, so Craigie on Main is quite tough for me to review, so I've decided to base my rating here on the several times I've gone and gotten the tasting menu, the a la carte menu, and the burger. I've gone to Craigie way more than that for the Sunday Chef's Whim, which is quite a hit-or-miss meal in my opinion, but I'm choosing to leave those out of this review since you're supposed to go to those knowing what you're getting into and knowing that the meal might be strange or experimental. \n\nSo here goes. Craigie is absolutely on-point with service, atmosphere, and food/drinks. \n\nThe service is always, always top-notch. Waitstaff is knowledgeable and friendly, and the pacing of meals is always great. Atmosphere is very welcoming and lovely, and I think it's cool that the kitchen is completely open. The bar area is totally awesome, with great bartenders and a very intimate feel. The whole place feels classy but also laid back and people in suits fit there just as well as people in more casual clothing.\n\nOn to the food. It's meticulously crafted, innovative, fun, and usually surprising. The burger is (of course) fantastic, if you manage to get one before they sell out each evening. The bone marrow is juicy and rich. Definitely get the fried clams with squid ink mousse if they are on the menu. I've yet to have a fish entree that wasn't delicious and delicate. They have a great cocktail menu, and can recommend great wines and beers to go with the food as well. Dessert is, perhaps, the only part of the menu that can sometimes fail me, but I've noticed Cragie's desserts have gotten better and better over the years. \n\nOverall, you're going to have an expensive meal, but you're going to enjoy it and it's going to be memorable."]
['My sister\'s boyfriend is perhaps a bigger foodie than me. Maybe not a bigger foodie, but a different kind of foodie. I look through Yelp, Eater and Infatuation, he reads the Michelin and Zagat guides. Must be nice working in consulting. I happen to like sleep, though. Anyway, he and my sister have tried a whole bunch of fine dining spots over the course of their relationship and have compiled a pretty substation "to try" list, similar to mine but adjusted for budget. So for my sister\'s college graduation dinner, her boyfriend had a suggestion all cued up and ready to go. Enter Craigie on Main. It turned out to be pretty perfect for my family. Though we\'re all some variation of food, most of us don\'t particularly care if a place is wildly high-brow or not. Craigie on Main is a fantastic, high-quality place, but still down to earth. Great service, equally stellar food and drinks and an environment that makes you want to stay a while. \n\nWe came here as a party of six. My immediate family, plus the two boyfriends. Craigie on Main offers a number of different ordering options: tasting, prix fixe and a la carte. The downside--and this isn\'t unique to Craigie--is that if you want to opt for tasting, the whole table needs to be on board. So though my bf and I were contemplating the tasting menu, the rest of our party was not quite as ambitious. We still got the visuals though--Craigie has an open kitchen (always love getting to watch the masters at work) so we got to peak in at the night\'s lineup.\n\nOur waiter for the night was fantastic. Personable, energetic, upbeat and great recommendations. Particularly when it came to liquor options. Though Craigie is a restaurant first, the alcohol selection is serious. A great list of whiskeys and a really impressive cocktail menu. I knew I wasn\'t going to be drinking for quite a while after this particular night, so I went a little overboard with ordering. It didn\'t hurt that my parents were paying *and* it was a special occasion. Whoops. For my first drink, I went with the Stay Gold, Ponboy (ron dipolomatico, pecan-infused sherry, cayenne, gran clasico). Great one to start with, well balanced with a little kick. I also had a small sip of my mom\'s first drink, the Spearitt Animal (hine cognac, pear liquer, sage, citrus, black walnut, egg white). Complex and perfectly frothy. My second drink was the Thai Basil Smash (cap rock organic gin, thai basil, chili water, ginger, lime), which was a no-brainer for me. Always been a fan of the thai/basil/gin combination. I finished with the Mellow Yellow (mckenna bourbon, chartreuse, becherovka, apricot brandy), which was another very-well balanced drink. About halfway through this drink my memory started to get a bit cloudy so sadly my report on this one isn\'t quite as clear. The gist: the mixologists and cocktail program here are not to scoff at.\n\nWhen it comes to food, Craigie on Main focuses on majestic meats. You know a place emphasizes its proteins when its got a section of menu dedicated to meats to be split between two (the pork dishes here being the most famous ones). The bf and I wanted to have some more variety in our meal, so we got a nice medley of plates, all coursed out to our liking. As expected, the proteins were cooked to perfection--with great variety, too. Eats, below: \n\nOlive Oil-Poached Spanish Octopus: A\nI\'m a broken record with these octopus plates. I\'m not sure if I have anything original left. Octopus is up there in the running for my most favorite food and I eat it everywhere. The preparation was somewhat simple in flavors but clearly quite refined in preparation. The tentacles had just the right amount of crisp and tenderness.\n\nAsparagus: A-\nThe bf didn\'t like that these were served cold but we needed some solid veggies to go with our meat-heavy meal. And I actually enjoyed the plate overall. Simple but yummy and fresh. The bread crumbs and seeds made it feel more complete/refined and added some nice texture. I\'m all for textural variety in my food, so I appreciated the intent here.  \n\nCrispy-Fried Essex Clams w/ preserved lemon, pickled peppers, dried black olive, squid ink anchoïade: A+\nOne of our two favorite dishes of the night. I\'m no stranger to squid ink or clams, but this preparation was innovative and seriously tasty. The clams were just the right of fried and the squid "anchoïade" made them all the more decadent. The light/citrusy flavors pairing with the umami of the ink--amazing.\n\nVermont Pork Three Ways: Roasted Shoulder, Slow-Cooked Belly, and Spice-Crusted Rib w/ radishes, whole grain mustard, rutabaga: A+\nObviously the climax of our evening. This place knows how to cook a mean piece of pork. They\'ve mastered all the different renditions in all the different ways. I can\'t remember which variety I liked best. The ribs took me back to my early pork-eating days (I was never the best Jew in that way)\n\nI did have an "after dinner whiskey" I cannot recall which kind. It was good, and it did me in.']
["Food Excellent!  Service Perfect! Drinks innovative! \nMUSIC...OBNOXIOUS!  RUDE. WRONG!\nThis is a nice French restaurant.  Our bill was $400.for 2 ppl. No problem....the MUSIC almost ruined the night. Distracting loud 80's rock.  Our waitress kindly apologized said the bartenders choose what they like. Owners should take back this choice. It was my birthday and.i was expecting much more class from this restaurant. Great meal. Disappointing Experience. \nI am a foodie and as much as I loved the food. I would not return until that aspect changed.\nJungle Boogie....Really?"]
["Visited Craigie on Main during a recent visit to Cambridge at the recommendation of a native friend. For a Friday night, we were pleasantly surprised that there were many tables open and even four seats at the bar for us. \n\n- Drinks: The drinks were amazing, while I only had red wine, my other three friends tried various cocktails and said they loved each of them. The bartenders were very knowledgeable about all the drinks and helpful in narrowing down a drink choice for my friends. \n\nThe variety of drinks were wide and many were unique and very classy. The novelty of the huge single ice cubes and other components of certain drinks were interesting and fun as well. \n\n- Service: While we were at the bar, the service by the bartenders was great! They were very informative, prompt, friendly and even chimed in during some of our conversations here and there which made the experience even better. They provided wonderful input about other restaurants and bars in the area as well. \n\nWe ended up staying up to closing, and I wish everyone could observe the care and attention the bartender paid to each bottle and instrument in cleaning up and stowing them away for the next day. Certainly a good sign that they value their product and service!\n\n- Atmosphere: This is certainly a classy place, not in an overly formal sense but that it offers quality service and drinks, and caters to a mature audience it seems. It was a great venue for us to catch up with friends, but could easily be a great place for any occasion. \n\nI would go back again and again, and certainly will visit Craigie on Main the next time I'm in the area!"]
["Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink):\n1 star:  Never again.\n2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back.\n3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad.\n4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return.\n5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.\n\nCame in expecting a good meal, but did not expect the level of excellence of the food here.  The negatives I'll put out here right away - we did the 8-course tasting and the pacing was rough.  3 hours for 8 courses.  We've had 15 course tastings in that time.  There were some long stretches between some of the courses but fortunately, the food was excellent.  Also, no set beverage pairing.  Not a big flaw, but it would have been nice to have a set option for all the different dishes instead of cobbling together glasses and half-bottles and such.\n\nService was friendly and casual, in contrast to the really high level of the food.  We came for a special occasion and they did not disappoint - hooked up with some free bubbly and an extra dessert.  (This review doesn't take this into consideration.)\n\nOur menu consisted of:\nTrio of fish amuse - 2 of the 3 were quite good\nSoft shell crab tempura - excellent, one of the best soft shell crab dishes of my life\nTrout tail for 2 - very good\nPhytoplankton pasta with shrimp and peeky-toe crab - not just one of the best pastas of ym life, one of the best dishes I have ever had\nSweetbreads - perhaps the weakest dish of the night\nLamb two ways - excellent\nButtermilk panna cotta with mango\nShortbread ice cream sandwich with berries and Chantilly cream\nChocolate terrine with caramel corn and ginger ice cream\n\nThe desserts as a whole weren't as spectacular as the rest of the meal.  (Proving once again how difficult pastry and dessert is to master.)  But the fact that a couple of the dishes that came out were lifetime top dishes - that says a lot.  \n\nIn terms of who I'm comparing this place to - it's tough.  It's not Michelin refined, but the food and atmosphere doesn't quite fit your average smart-casual fine dining - it falls right in the middle.  Which is perhaps why this place managed to both surprise, exceed expectations, and please."]
["Have you heard about the burger? If you have, why haven't you had it yet?? They only make 18 a night and if youre not outside the restaurant by 5pm waiting in line (they open at 5:30), then youre not getting one. Seriously, they sold out in a record five minutes. Only sold at the bar though and not on the menu! It was $19 when I came and you can add bacon and an egg for an extra charge but honestly, why mess with the classic.\n\nThe meat itself is a combo of three different meats and bone marrow which makes it extra juicy. It has some great spices in there too that made the patty definitely unlike something youve had before. Not your average burger! They suggest you order medium rare which is the sign of good quality meat. It comes with lettuce, onions, and homemade ketchup which is seriously good and I'm a ketchup snob. It has a touch of sweetness to it and I ended up asking for more. There's also red wine pickles and celery root slaw served on the side. I used the slaw as refreshing thing between bites instead of on the burger.\n\nIt also came with huge steak fries and a side salad and the salad was honestly the meh part of the meal. I ain't ordering a burger to eat a salad but hey, that's just me. The service was so nice, the manager was very friendly and the bartender, Kim, was personable and attentive. \n\nThey also give you bread and butter which was so nice and a little almost chocolate dessert with your check."]
["Finally got to taste the legendary Craigie secret burger... And the rumors did not disappoint! Absolutely fantastic. The burger came with giant wedge fries, a small mesclun greens salad, and a small tray of extras that included housemade red wine pickles, celery root slaw, and ketchup (the ketchup was aces, none of that store brand sugary stuff).\n\nThe atmosphere was also perfect, just what I was looking for: classy but comfortable and relaxed. Loved the bar area. The two bartenders, Micah and Rob, were excellent. Friendly, fun, and very knowledgeable about their craft. I can't wait to go back!"]
["Fantastic. Craigie on Main is one of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. The food is imaginative, expertly cooked, and offers many familiar dishes with unfamiliar preparations. I tried their prix fixe menu, which consisted of three courses and amuse bouche. The Spanish octopus was one of the most incredible I've ever enjoyed with some cirspy bits at one end and an extremely tender interior that tasted like buttery lobster. The Vermont Pork Three Ways also showed how the chefs could masterfully prepare one animal in three spectacular ways that all worked together on the plate. I'm not big on desserts, but Craigie does it right with wonderful flavors that aren't cloyingly sweet and just the right portion size. A meal at Craigie might cost more than a casual night out, but it is worth it!"]
['Had an incredible, out-of-the-ordinary experience at Craigie on Main recently. Tony Maws and company collaborated with Tasting Table and Mastercard Priecless for a butchery 101 class and it was amazing! The event started off with delicious hors d\'oeuvres and an open bar featuring a champagne and whiskey cocktail, all of which were really good.\n\nWe then made our way into the kitchen, where Tony demoed to a small group of us on how to prepare a lamb rack, whole fish, and chicken. We even got to butcher our own chicken and then bring it home. \n\nProceeding the class, we were led to the dining room where we had a 3 course meal featuring a summer salad, heritage chicken with quinoa, and a shortcake with coconut ice cream and fresh fruit. One of my favorite aspects of the event was the education on our protein sources. Tony really inspired me to reconsider the options that we\'re faced with on a day-to-day basis. He told us that "if you\'re eating a chicken breast and it\'s not delicious, it\'s not a good chicken." The heritage chicken breast that I ate was definitely the best I\'ve ever had.  \n\nReally wish they had more events like this! Definitely check it out if you ever get the opportunity!']
["I just ate at this trendy stupid place in Cambridge. I came because THE BURGER was supposed to be the best... they sold-out the burger. So, NO BURGER at 6:30 pm.\n\nNow I have to pay $40 for some stupid crap, and I'm still hungry."]
['Been here a couple of times now - including for brunch and would say while the food is good the reputation they have is overstated.  Absolutely nothing spectacular.']
["Best burger ever - legendary and oh-so-tasty!! Tastebuds burst into Hallelujah Chorus at the bite of beefy AMEN. A study in perfect composition:\n- 8 oz. grass-fed goodness with bone marrow and suet, seasoned with dehydrated miso, hold the salt, for mega umami. Have not had a more flavorful, moist, juicy burger - worth every bite!\n- dressed with fresh heirloom, lettuce\n- house-made milk bun, griddled a la plancha, topped with sesame seeds. A good bun shows they care!\n- accouterments hold their own: house-made ketchup, red wine vinegar pickles, celery root slaw\n- thick-cut, crispy steak fries for maximum enjoyment\n- best enjoyed at the bar\n\nSTAY THIRSTY\nThe cocktail program might be one of the best in town - trifecta of Seasonal, Stirred and Shaken. My Pepper in the Rye (well-played) packed a spicy punch with peppercorn-infused overholt - balanced with cardamaro, picon amaro, grapefruit. Fantastic bartender concocted a Trinidad sour - quite a refreshing treat - and a lovely mocktail for my friend. Can't wait to be back - you'll find me making fast friends with the Stirred libations."]
["This is one of those restaurants that was overhyped for me. I went in with really high expectations because all of my friends were telling me how good it was here. I spent about 200 dollars here for a 5 course tasting menu that didn't blow me away.\n\nThe courses were as follows:\n\n1: sardine on a ritz cracker\n2: two pieces of sashimi\n3: monkfish with one shrimp\n4: two pieces of lamb with 2 bite size lamb sausages and 2 bite size potatoes\n5: dessert\n\nThe portions were small but you have to expect that from an upscale restaurant. I was hoping the next dish would be better than the last but I found myself expecting more from the next dish every time and was never satisfied. I can't say the dishes were bad, but they were not amazing, especially for 200 dollars. The best dish was probably the lamb (even though I don't like lamb and ended up giving the dish to my bf), however, it was pretty tender for those who do like lamb.\n\nI was hoping the tasting menu would be a small snapshot of what they serve on their regular menu but none of the dishes served were on their regular menu. The presentation was great but I go for the taste, not the looks. Maybe I'll be back one day to try out the normal menu but probably not anytime soon."]
["You wouldn't think much about this semi-hidden spot in the middle of Cambridge. Tucked away on Main street, it's a place that I will probably only go once or twice, regrettably. And that's just because my poor bank account wouldn't be able to handle it. My taste buds would beg to differ though.\n\nMy sister and I came here for a special occasion meal. It's one of those restaurants that, when you leave your seat to use the restroom, they will fold your napkin for you again and place it on your seat.\n\nWe ordered cocktails (thumbs up on all of them) and started with the crispy fried clams. They tasted really fresh and even though I had my hesitations about fried food at an upscale restaurant, it did the trick as an appetizer. We also ordered the corn and, if you like elote, you will love this. As simple as corn is, I think this might have been one of my favorites.\n\nI ordered the salmon with clams. The menu changes all the time so take this with a grain of salt. I've never had salmon melt in my mouth like that. I think it was cooked just perfectly with a hint of rawness like you'd get in sashimi but still juicy.\n\nFor dessert we got the chocolate and the cheesecake. My dessert standards aren't terribly high and if anything has chocolate in it I will eat it in a heartbeat but they were delicious regardless.\n\nI highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely have to attempt this secret burger next time I come."]
['Never again.  I should have gone back to Cafe ArtScience...service poor, food decent, experience &amp; food sub-par and overrated.']
["ohhhh my goodness the burger is amazing. definitely tricky to get it (they only serve it in the bar area and only serve 18 a night) but we scored an early reservation and couldn't have been happier about it. dirty martinis were great too!"]
['Great place with excellent food, cool ambience and amazing service. We started with a couple of first courses: the fried clams which was the best plate of the whole dinner and the duck pathe. The clams were amazing, breaded with spices and with a dark sauce. The pathe was great too with toast. They brought a couple of amouse boy he that were delicious (Coppa with fruit and smoked salmon). The entree we got was the three way pork that was delicious, great combination of different parts of the pork and a variety of cooking styles. As a side they brought a complimentary pasta that was very tasty. For dessert we closed with a complimentary Panna cotta that was smooth and had great flavor. But the other highlight of the dinner was the cheesecake, probably the best one I have had in my life. Drinks were good too and loved that they give you tastings. Would love to be back!']
["One of the best meals I've had in Boston so far. My boyfriend and I came here for dinner to celebrate our anniversary. What we got: \n- Appetizers: \n  Both were fantastic, fresh seafood dishes. \n  (1) Mussels: The broth in this dish was complex and didn't overwhelm the mussels themselves\n  (2) Fried clams: Every element--anchoiade (squid ink sauce/dip), preserved lemon, pickled peppers--was great. Full of flavor\n\n- Main: Roasted pig's head for two\n  Super fun. Definitely not a sight that you will forget--and having to do the work to carve it will just reinforce that. Coming from a bio background, I loved that I got to appreciate the preparation and the anatomy of the animal at the same time. (And yes, it was delicious).\n\n- Sides:\n  Lamb-fat roasted brussels sprouts: I really liked this! A lot of restaurants will mask the brussels sprouts flavor with a really strong vinaigrette or something, whereas this tasted like a more decadent version of olive oil roasted brussels sprouts.\n\nService:\nOur server (shout-out to Micah!) made sure we had a wonderful experience. Food, drinks, etc. were all well-timed (it never felt like we were waiting, even though the menu states that the pig's head takes 45 mins since it is roasted to order) and we never felt rushed."]
['The food is good, but not great, but definitely does not justify the wait. The menu is a very  small fixed 3 course or 5 course menu. LESS THAN 10 first courses and maybe 6 entrees. We ordered swordfish and pork three ways from the menu, no special requirements. It took more than an hour wait from finishing the first course to entrees, and after checking with waiter twice after an hour. I understand it was a Sunday evening, but the restaurant was not packed. The swordfish was good. The pork rib was little too dry and under-seasoned. We skipped the desert just out of fear another long wait.']
['My girlfriend and I went to the "Lucky" New Year brunch as our first visit to the restaurant and I, for one, left disappointed. The food was OK, the burger excellent, but for $50/pp the menu seriously lacked. \n\nFirst course was an option of a small, maybe 2 oz. smoothie or a four grain porridge. I had the smoothie. My date, who has issues with dairy first thing in the morning, managed to secure a small frissee salad, albeit after substantial prodding. We were both fairly satisfied with what we received in isolation. My girlfriend ordered the burger, which arrived perfectly cooked and delicious. My cotechino and lentils was just ok. I\'m used to heavy seasoning but this was a little over the top.\n\nDessert was tasty, a deliciously tangy cheesecake that I would definitely try again. All in all we were pretty happy on the way out of the door thinking it was a relatively solid 4 star experience.\n\nThen, in the car, I remembered how to do math. Brunch was a $50 prix fixe, the burger is usually $19 and the cheesecake $12. DID I REALLY JUST PAY $20 FOR TWO SPOONFULS OF FRUIT PUREE AND YOGURT?\n\nI guess the "lucky" part of the brunch is for the owners who get people to fall for it...']
["More like a 4.5 star.\n\nI liked the food better than French Laundry.  Very happy I came.  \nPrices were not outrages compared to the Cali places. \nWe sat at the Chefs counter and saw the action in the kitchen.  It was entertaining. \n\nWent alacarte for the food because the tasting menu items were not particularly compelling. \n\nGreat:\nSteak with sweetbreads were the best I've ever had.\nStripe sea bass\nOctopus\nOysters (dashed with a wonderful acidic sauce)\n\nThe service was the only let down, though it is often mentioned as a key strength.   Maybe it was just an off night but enough for us to be noticeable."]
["Yeah obviously very, very good.  The buns are made there and are soft with a slight crunch.  The wedges are delightful and I'm pretty sure they even make their own ketchup. Don't forget the fried egg on top.\n\nVery very rich though.  Eat slowly and don't over do it..."]
['Trekked here on that snowy night last weekend and surprised to find the place still quit packed despite the road outside, always a good sign.\n\nThey offer prix fixe tasting as well as a la carte menu. But seeing that the prix fixe require the entire table\'s participation, we decided to order separately.\n\nThe octopus appetizer was probably the biggest hit of the night, and I dare say 1 of the best I\'ve ever had. Large pieces of tentacles, perfectly cooked, the speck and kale accompaniments were great as well. A+\n\nI opted for the phytoplankton pasta with uni sauce and a few other things I don\'t remember. It is actually much tamer than it sounds. Green pasta with a creamy sauce, not really "oceany" and couldn\'t taste the uni at all. B\n\nSince we\'re not going to be frequent visitors, decided to go all out and get the half pig\'s head, which is the famous dish here. This is true head to tail dining (especially if you order the pig\'s tails for appetizer) and it\'s certainly not for the faint of heart. Even if you\'ve been to a pig roast, digging down into the head, revealing the jaw bone and the teeth underneath, was quite something else. It is served Peking duck style. It\'s incredibly fatty, not too much meat on the head. So imagine pork belly but even fattier. It was certainly delicious but I was full/overwhelmed by its intensity quickly. Thankfully our waiter recommend the pinot noir for me. Even though I didn\'t like it too much on first taste, it really help cut through all the fat and paired perfectly with the pig\'s head. B+\n\nCoconut sorbet was a nice refreshing end to the dinner and I had to start thinking about working out the next day after this...\n\nOverall a very nice and adventurous meal. Will be back some other time.']
["My boyfriend and I have gazed longingly upon Craigie for years, never taking the plunge. I decided to take him for his 25th birthday....and I wasn't impressed. We did the chefs whim and I noticed when we got the bill that we were charged for 6 courses.....we didn't receive 6 courses. We signed up for 6, but didn't receive 6. The food was definitely good, but not at all worth the price and I was a little underwhelmed. My experience with tasting menus has usually left me talking nonstop about at least one portion of it for a few days after...I can't even remember everything we had. It was pretty forgettable."]
["Me and my girlfriend has been wanting to go to this place for quite awhile and we finally found a excuse to go when she got her new job. \nThe interior of the restaurant is quite intimately without being stuck up, our waitress was incredible nice and friendly and the service was superb.  \nFor cocktails, I got the Sherry Cobbler, which was quite fruity and refreshing, just the way I liked it. My girlfriend got the Aperol Spritz, which made well.\nWe decided to go with 1 appetizer and 2 entrees. We got the Crispy Fried Pig Tailed for appetizer, it was surprisingly substantial for an appetizer and was very tasty, juicy and quite fatty. It was topped with house made onion rings which was good to balance the slightly over salty dish. \nFor entree, we both got the 'Vermont Pork Three Ways: Slow-Cooked Belly, Roasted Tenderloin, Spice-Crusted Rib'. My favorite was the rib, which was very crispy and flavorful and well seasoned. My least favorite was the pork belly, the strip of belly is about 30% fat, it was tasty initially, but after eating the entire piece, I felt a little sickened by all the fat and desperately needed something sweet or refreshing to wash the fat down my throat. \nCraigie on Main is a solid restaurant for pork lovers, the atmosphere is intimate, the service is great, but the food is just not quite 5 stars in my books."]
["I've been here so many times for the burger, which is excellent. I've also come for dinner/drinks/dessert and always been pleased...but now things have changed!\n\nThe tasting menu sounded like it would rival No.9. NOPE. I was not a happy camper.\n\nCourse 1 - Trio of Amuse Bouches - Clams, smoked mackerel (too salty), and monkfish liver (good)\n\nCourse 2 - Hamachi sashimi - this was the only thing I truly enjoyed, it was super fresh and delicious.\n\nCourse 3- Monkfish with rock shrimp and celery puree. Overall this was fine but I'm not a huge fan of celery puree and there was not enough flavor/pop to the dish.\n\nCourse 4- Two cod fish heads! I was excited about this dish because I have fish head a lot but unfortunately it did not have a lot of flavor. It was fun to eat and it was okay...but for a tasting I would expect higher quality fish/meat. There isn't much on the heads but it was fun presentation wise.\n\nCourse 5- Black Trumpet mushrooms with pasta. This was aright and came as a replacement because one of the previous dishes was extremely salty. Originally we had a dish of house made pasta with uni butter and clams but it was inedible. \n\nCourse 6- Pheasant three ways. The sausage (with liver/heart) was way too salty but the confi pheasant itself was very good. Presentation was quite nice. \n\nCourse 7- Pre dessert was amazing. A little pumpkin with marshmellow + ice cream. The actual dessert course was spiced chocolate tart which was fine.\n\nAlso our waitness had asked if we were celebrating something (we were) and suggested a toast. We asked for prosecco and received two glasses. Later on we found out that it was 17 per glass. I don't usually check on price for suggestions for a glass but now I will? Overall I was disappointed and our bill was higher than No.9 :(.\n\nI'll come back for the burger but no more tastings."]
['Food was good but nothing extraordinary.  The service was extremely courteous and cheery but really, really, really s-l-o-w.  Had the five-course tasting menu for $85.  With the exception of the final entree--a seared duck breast with\nfoie gras --each course was literally 2 or 3 bites.  But the whole meal took literally two hours--almost as if they thought the meal would feel more substantial if the dishes were spaced apart by 20-30 minutes.  The wait was excessive, to the point where I felt bored and impatient by meal\'s end.  Ideally, each item in a tasting menu should make a subtle gesture to the previous and succeeding courses, either by texture, presentation, flavor or ingredient.  However, with the excessive wait between courses, the continuity between dishes was lost, the courses became somewhat disjointed, and the composition of the meal as a whole was lost.\n\nThe menu began with hamachi complemented with lime, ruby grapefruit, and avacado.  The idea was laudable, but the citrus lover powered the hamachi a bit.  The second course was a julienne with fermented Serrano ham, treviso (chicory), hazelnut and Parmesan.  The fermented ham made for a really unusual and frankly delicious backdrop.  I have not had this before, or at least not in this way.  It reminded me of one of my mother\'s tradition Chinese dishes with fermented vegetables.  The third wish was a conchiglie ragu with wood ear (?) mushroom and Parmesan, which was delicious and deceptively rich and substantive.  It had the texture and flavor of Veronese horse meat, though I am sure it was not.  The fourth course was sumptuous seared duck breast with a decadent foie gras.  There was a fifth dish, but that seems so long ago....  I\'m sure I\'ll remember sometime after hitting the "post" button on this review.\n\nI\'ve had two or three -hour tasting menus before (Gary Danko, Bouley, Daniel, Le Bernardin, Saison, etc), but those were substantive, carefully orchestrated 9-10 -course events.  This one just went on and on and on and with really not much food and not much continuity.\n\nStill though the food was enjoyable, each course thoughtfully composed and carefully crafted.  I would return but rather than order the tasting menu would go a la carte, which, judging from other tables right and left, seemed to make for a livelier more efficient dining experience.']
['We came back to give Craigie on Main another try, and we were not disappointed.\nAlthough we did not order burgers this time, we were seated in the bar area without a reservation at 5:30, right when they opened. \n\nSince we were sitting in the bar area, they definitely pushed getting drinks on us. We were planning to get drinks elsewhere afterward, so we opted not to get cocktails. However, there was a "punch" available that was almost like a pre-cocktail, so I went with that. They called it the Burning Bush, and it had bright citrus flavors.\n\nfood\n+ RAGOUT, locally foraged mushrooms &amp; forked potatoes: This is a great starter with a fresh farm egg, Brussels sprouts, and other light greens. \n+ PORK THREE WAYS: There are three cuts of pork with a spice crusted rib, pork belly, and sausage. This is a great way to try pork in a way you have never had before! I personally love small plates of food to try as much as I can, so having three different types of cuts and flavorings was just what I wanted. \n+ LOCAL SWORDFISH: The swordfish was already cut and plated so that putting your knife into the fish broke it apart. The flavors with pesto, seafood, and fennel worked really well together.']
["This was one of the best dining experiences I've had. To simply this review I'm going to break down various aspects of the restaurant.\n\nService:\nTop notch service which seems like a team of servers attending your table. Chef provides us with some small bites and samples which were all truly amazing. Very friendly people and great environment\n\nDrinks:\nTalk about a proper drink in Boston. This isn't your basic bar these folks know what they are doing. Cocktails are roughly 11-14$ but are actually made properly. I ordered an old fashioned and it was phenomenal had the big ice cube right amount of bitters just great.\n\nFood:\nWe ordered the pig tails to start and boy are those things great. They are super fatty and a melt in you mouth texture with an Asian fusion sauce topped with hand battered onion rings. These were the true star and would come back for these alone.  The burger that everyone raves about is fairly good I would rate it 8.5/10 as it was heavy on the pepper but had a nice meat blend and a lot of hand crafted components.  We didn't try any of the entrees as they are priced fairly high but the burger is only 18$ which is good consider its quality of components. You need to come early as they have a limited supply and it seems everyone waiting in line prior to opening is getting one.\n\nWill definitely come back for the experience, a great spot to celebrate the new job!"]
["The presentation and wait service were perfect and intense.  But it's too formal for my taste.  They went out of their way to make the three of us feel welcome and comfortable.  But I felt self conscious with all the attention.\n\nWe ordered the 3 course pris fixe menu. These are the dishes. I tasted all of them.\n\n!. Crisp fried clams\n2. Tomato Salad\n3. Rigatini with chicken and mushrooms\n4. Steak\n5. Pork\n6. Chicken\n7  Chocolate pate with Sour Cream Ice Cream\n8. Coconut Sorbet\n8. Sheep's Milk Cheese Cake\n\n\nEach sauce individually was the best I'd ever had.  But they gave you two or three sauces for a piece of meat. It was overwhelming.  Everything is bespoke here. Next time come, only if it's on somebody else's expense account, I'll special request few flavors per dish.\n\nWe came on a Wednesday night. It was obvious from the tables of men that it was an business account restaurant for the corporate techies.  And the menu reflected that.....lots of hearty red meat and game.\n\nThis restaurant is best if you are doing business or live in the immediate neighborhood. There isn't much convenient free or paid parking. I do not recommend for date night."]
["Second time coming here and it was just as delectable as the first.  No flukes here people!  It's definitely in the ballpark of 4.5-5 stars depending on the little nuances.   We started off running 30-40 minutes late for our reservation but right away, they were happy and ready to take us to our corner table.  5 stars on our first impression when greeted.   \n\nOn a coin toss, we ended up getting the 6 course Craigie Experience and here's what our spread was for that night:\n\nCourse 1 - Trio of Amuse Bouches - Beautiful presentation with razor clams, smoked trout and mackerel.  Each little bite sized morsel was excellent and got us excited for what was to come.  When I say I was excited, I mean I ate the whole thing before I remembered to take a picture of it and that NEVER happens.  \n\nCourse 2 - Hamachi sashimi - Clean, high quality and delicious.  \n\nCourse 3 - Monk fish - Ah the Monk fish.  One of the things that I love about Craigie (this time and last) is that they know how to cook fish.  Delicately flavored and cooked perfectly; flakes right off your fork; no knives needed.  \n\nCourse 4 - Orecchiette with tomatoes - Cooked Al Dente; Love the chewiness and bounciness of the pasta. \n\nCourse 5 -  Trout with polenta.  Again, fresh, clean and simply prepared but cooked perfectly.   \n\nCourse 6 - Chocolate mousse and corn bread - Both were awesome sweet endings to a nice and light tasting menu.  \n\nOverall, a fantastic place.  Ambiance is upscale and romantic without being pretentious.  Service has been impeccable both times.  You're never looking around for anyone and the staff is extremely knowledgeable of the menu. I loved how they presented each course and took time to explain how each was prepared and with what ingredients.  This is and will always be a great treat.     \n\nAlso see Sylvia C's review for our first time at Craigie (ROTD); Also 5 stars."]
['Disclaimer: I came here for the Sunday "Chef\'s Whim" special, in hopes that we could get an awesome dinner for an inexpensive price.\n\nThis wonderful restaurant went above and beyond my expectations (and my expectations were pretty high to begin with). I dined here with my sister and brother, and while my sister eats anything like I do, my brother has a long list of dietary restrictions and other than that tends to be a picky eater.\n\nOur server was awesome, very down-to-earth but still very professional. Our meal lasted about two hours, but it didn\'t seem too long because the courses were evenly spaced out. Presentation for the courses was amazing, and honestly everything was delicious. I had never had squid ink before and after this visit, I wish I could put that stuff on everything. It was life-changing.\n\nOnly con was the girl that was coming by to sometimes give plates or drinks. She had a uncaring attitude and seemed like she didn\'t know what was going on and was flippant when we asked her for more information.\n\nI highly recommend the Chef\'s Whim - we also watched the improv show around the corner at Boston Improv to kill time and it was great!']
["IT'S SO GOOD.\n\nThe food is great, the atmosphere is great.  The bartender (we sat at the bar) is GREAT.  It's really expensive, but also really great.  The food, the cocktails, the staff, it's all worth it.  Thank you, ROB!"]
["Fantabolous. Went there for our 12th wedding anniversary. Once we told the server the same, she was on a mission to make the night special. We got the 5 course chef tasting menu. If we didn't love a course they'd try their best to hook us up with another one. Great vibes, great food. I feel lame for leaving them another 5 star review but also I don't care."]
['My husband and I wanted to try the burger for the longest time. We went there during a rainy day 15 min before opening time to get it. It was so yummy. Everything is greasy and flavorful. Our hands got messy fast. The salad suddenly taste so good to cut the heaviness of the burger. The fries were fried in burger juice or something, it also tastes wonderful. We got full quite fast too. My husband stays up late last night and ate both of our leftover. I got up and wanted the burger for breakfast (dont judge me please) My husband told me with his innocent face that he ate it all.']
["I've been here a few years ago and remember that i really enjoyed my meal. So when my husband and i were visiting Boston, i wanted to take him here to try it. We were so excited about our date night and dinner at Craigie on Main and at the end, we were left so disappointed.\n\nOur server did not come to our table for at least 15 minutes after we sat down. Someone came by and said she's busy, and that she'll be right there...and we just kept waiting and waiting. finally, we had to flag down someone else and ask for our server again. This other waiter took our drink order...but we just sat there waiting.\n\nAfter the server came to our table and explained the 6 course tasting menu. My husband and i both decided to try it. I did the seafood version, and his had meat. My first course was ceviche, then there was a fish, a pasta, the next was scallop, a granita and a dessert. All the courses were very small and it's never happened that i left a tasting menu feeling hungry afterwards. We were also disappointed that they try to pass a granita off as a course - most restaurant serve that as a palette cleanser.\n\nWe also received our granita before our main entree...the person just dropped it off. and then another server, not ours, came by and just took it back. The whole night's service was off and it certainly did not live up to our expectation. The entire dinner also took more than 2.5 hours because our server was so busy/slow."]
['Art, not food! Each course layered with surprising, unique, and creative flavors and textures. This type of restaurant is a special occasion splurge, so we were thrilled with the meticulous attention to every detail which made the entire experience perfect. We had the Tasting Menu, 5 courses of variety, with little treats in between. Because my boyfriend mentioned it was my birthday when he made the reservation, a "Happy Birthday" card from the owner awaited us at our lovely corner table. Each staff member was friendly, knowledgeable, and on top of our every need. I can\'t say enough about the food. Just go!']
["Let me tell you, I'm all about riding the hype train. When I found out about the burger at Craigie, I knew I had to try it. As a quick primer for anyone who is not aware, Craigie serves 18 of their off-the-menu burgers every night. The 8 oz grass-fed patty is made of three different cuts of beef with bone marrow and suet, seasoned with dehydrated miso, and served on a homemade bun with mace ketchup, lettuce and onions cooked in the beef juices, and a slice of yellow tomato.\n\nOur group of three got to Craigie at 5PM thanks to my persistent nagging and we were successfully the first ones in line. While waiting for the doors to open, I did some reading on the burger to kill time and by the time we were let in at 5:30PM, I felt slightly bad for coming just for the burger (Eater article that I read, for reference: http://boston.eater.com/2015/4/17/8442815/the-reluctant-burger-titans-of-boston#4702168)\n\nRegardless of my slight guilt, our group of three was graciously let in and I made what, at the time, seemed like a grave mistake of telling the hostess that we wanted to sit in the bar area (instead of just sitting at the bar). I then proceeded to freak out as the 11 other people (yes I counted) who were lined up behind me filled all the bar seats as we stood to the side waiting for our table to be set up. There was no way I just waited 30 minutes to not get a burger--nuh uh. I would've moved heaven and earth for the burger at that point.\n\nWe got seated shortly after my mini panic attack and our waiter was swift to take our order. We said we were interested in the burger and he told us he'd put in a hold order for us, but strongly urged us to look at the actual menu. We did, but didn't end up getting anything else (this coupled with that Eater article caused me to feel even more guilt).\n\nI ordered a Hotel Street Punch, which came out quickly and was very strong and very delicious. The service at Craigie is absolutely amazing. Our water glasses were never more than half empty before someone came over to refill our glasses (mind you, the bottle of still water was on our table and we would've happily refilled the glasses ourselves). The attentiveness of the wait staff is beyond anything I expected.\n\nWe didn't need to wait long for our burgers, and despite being seated after everyone at the bar, we got our food first (perks of being seated, perhaps?). So on to the burger!\n\nThe burger, in complete honesty, lived up to all the hype. The ingredients tasted so fresh--the salad served on the side was delicious and I don't even like salad. The patty was perfectly seasoned, incredibly juicy, and cooked to a nice medium rare. This was literally the most flavorful burger patty I've experienced. The mace ketchup added a nice kick as well, and I'm a sucker for yellow tomatoes so that sold me completely. I do have to admit that the burger is so dense with flavor that I had trouble finishing the last bite or so. I was very grateful for both the side salad and the amazing home fries that came with, as they balanced out the burger when the flavor felt overwhelming.\n\nBy 6PM, the burgers were sold out, so definitely get here early if you're looking to try the burger. You must sit at the bar or at the bar side of the restaurant to order the burger. At $18 per burger, this was definitely the most I've ever paid for a burger, but the first time experience was well worth both the price and the wait. I don't think I would come back frequently due to both these points and how heavy the flavor was. If you have a palate for heavier flavors though, this burger would be perfect.\n\nNow go forth, young padawan, and experience the burger at Craigie on Main for yourself!"]
['WHAT TO DO ON A COLD, WINDY &amp; SNOWY CAMBRIDGE NIGHT IN EARLY MARCH???\n\nHang out in the bar at Craigie on Main, of course!\n\nI always like to get to Craigie right when they open at 5:30PM to grab a seat in the bar.  But on a night like last night, I guess most of the after-work crowd decided to head straight home, so the bar was pleasantly deserted (although the restaurant did fill up by the time we were leaving).\n\nThe burger/fries/salad were perfect.  They still only make 18 burgers a day, but they even on a slow night they sell out.\n\nEric Books knocked our cocktails out of the park, and we also had a nice little glass of Barolo Chinato (a spiced Italian dessert wine) at the end of the meal.  Passed on dessert (but who could do it justice after such a rich burger?)\n\nService, as usual at Craigie is always perfect.']
['Wow.  Just Wow.  \n\nMy friend and I came to celebrate my birthday.  I must admit after our initial interactions with the staff, I was bracing myself for a tumultuous experience.\n\nWe walked in and were greeted by the host.  She and the woman who sat us must have had a very peculiar interaction with someone before we walked in because they didn\'t seem to be on their games at all.\n\nOnce we were seated, a waiter came over to ask for our drink order and what type of water we\'d like.  Then a manager came over to ask us the same thing.  A third person come to deliver our drink (mine was made incorrectly) and talk to us again.  I was apprehensive to say the least.\n\nAll of my misgivings were overshadowed and obliterated by our actual service!  My mis-made drink was fixed in short order.  Our waiter was courteous, attentive, conversational, personable, and always, ALWAYS delivered on what he said he would.  \n\nWe had the tasting menu, which was just exquisite.  My friend is a little more conservative in her wine palate than I.  Even though we didn\'t agree on everything at the first sip, by the end of the course, we couldn\'t have been happier.  If you\'re interested in a man who knows how to pair from "what\'s available," ask to sit in Juan\'s section.  You won\'t be disappointed.  \n\n1: The cevice was acidic, yet balanced.  I attribute much of that to the ginger oil, but what do I know?\n2: The asparagus was (blanched?  Steamed?  Whatever it was, it was perfectly tender, yet ate like a vegetable).  The sauce was a lovely add-in you almost missed if you didn\'t look at your fork.\n3: The rabbit with the pasta was paired expertly by Juan with a white wine that blew my socks off.  I took a picture of the bottle just to make sure I could have it again.\n4: The lamb was earthy and comforty.  Juan gave us a wine with a "barnyard" feel to it which my friend was not shy about expressing her distaste for.  By the end of the course, she was singing its praises like a converted choir member.\nIntermezzo: The kitchen furnished us with a goats-milk tapioca which was a wonderful palate cleanser.\n5:  We got separate deserts.  Crème caramel paired with a port and Chocolat Crèmeux paired with... wait for it... BEER.  It was delicious.  \n\nThere were other extras and pleasant notes along the way.  However, none of that was necessary to make the experience complete and whole.  This place is going into my regular rotation.']
["It's definitely expensive, but the food was incredible! I went when a company was buying, and we had a great time. We all ordered from the three course prix fixe menu, which also came with an amuse-bouche to start it off. The service was great. First, the amuse-bouche that was brought to me had an ingredient that I don't eat, and they quickly exchanged it for the other option. I had the octopus for my appetizer, which was well cooked and quite delicious. The main course that I chose was a vegetarian mushroom-filled crepe, and I really enjoyed it, too. To complement the meal, the wine and cocktail selections were also great. Overall, it made for a very nice evening of relaxing with colleagues and enjoying incredible food!"]
['I went there with my wife on a Tuesday night and was pleasantly surprised. First of all the place looks very very clean and dressy. Very classy. Second, the service was impeccable. Our server was extremely knowledgeable, pleasant, funny, prompt, respectful and many many more positive adjectives that I am not going to mention. Then comes the food.  Oh wait. The drinks, how can I forget the wonderful cocktails that we had. To bad I was driving, I just wanted more and more.  Then comes the amuse bush on the house. A very nice and delicious touch. The appetizers, the entries the desert, mmmmm. Definite gem.  A+++++']
['Burger looks amazing right? Good luck getting it. They make 15 a day and they go to the first 15 people.']
["I'd the bavette and it was cooked perfect.  Medium rare.  Good aroma. Taste was mild, not complicated. The complement was a bit weak but the focus was the bavette...\n\nI'd the chocolate cremeaux. It was creamy, complementing the walnut ice cream.\n\nServer was good. (Always, as I have been here several times but first time to review this menu.)"]
["Review of just the burger: First off, ordered it medium rare. It came closer to rare than medium rare cause the middle was still soft and not warm. The bartender said that was how they normally do medium rare so if that's not how you roll I suggest ordering medium. For me, the rarer parts of the burger did not have flavor and just reminded me of flavorless tartar. The parts of the burger that were more cooked I didn't taste any bone marrow cause all I got was black pepper. I did like the cheese and the onions that accompanied it. The fries were big thick steak cut ones which can't complain about that. I can't say that I'd order this again, but the bread basket I very much enjoyed and the service was 5 stars so I'd come back to check out some other stuff."]
["Service was exceptional, food was good but not good/creative/mind-blowing enough to justify the high price. As my partner puts it, you'll be happy to eat here so long as you're not the one paying.\n\nMost memorable and recommended is their fresh grapefruit juice - no bitter aftertaste, and really good when mixed with their sparkling water."]
["My friends who I went with really enjoyed it. I found it too noisy and there were not enough choices for me to find something that I would really love. For example I ordered the pork three ways and thought that it was so-so and definitely very fatty which was to be expected.  I also felt that instead of having all of these unusual names if items on the menu without explaining what they meant ( we googled them but it was a pain) it would've helped if the menu had explained them,   so we did not have to wait until going over everything with the waiter.  \n\n The food is definitely creative but I did not feel that it was worth the expense which came to almost $300 including tip &amp; a drink for each of the other two people."]
["So, we came back.  Our second experience made up for the first disappointing one.  Craigie definitely redeemed themselves.\n\nThis time, we decided to take a chance and walked in without reservations.  We also made it a point to arrive earlier, in hopes to be served the better options as soon as Chef's Whim started at 9:00pm.  We didn't care to be seated at Chef's Table anymore and were seated in a side room at a table near the bar.  \n\nWe opted for the 6 course Chef's Whim tasting and were given a basket of rolls (which were still relatively hard) and softened butter to eat while waiting.  The courses offered are as follows:\n\nAmuse Bouche: Wiley oyster, charred blood orange\nCourse 1:  Pastrami style sea trout over a horseradish cream\nCourse 2: Striped bass with manilla clam, razor clam, broccoli rabe, and cauliflower\nCourse 3:  Veloute of macomber turnip, squid ink breadcrumbs, chorizo, and sweetbread\nCourse 4: Pork 2 ways: Sausage and porcetta, served w/broccoli rabe, fingered potatoes, and apricot glaze\nPre-Dessert:  Pear and champagne sorbet with ginger meringue and tapioca\nCourse 5a:  Apple fritters with apple jam and a maple bourbon ice cream\nCourse 5b:  Salted chocolate mouse with coffee ice cream and coffee crumble\n\nHigh points:\n- Sea trout infused pastrami flavor? Super good\n- Razor clams are awesome.\n- Give me more of that apricot glaze! Put it on anything to make it taste bomb.\n- I could eat the pear and champagne dessert all day, every day. Perfect.\n- The ability to have two options for dessert is a plus.  (PS: Apple Fritters are the best out of the two!)\n- Service, as was the first time, was stellar.  We were described everything we were being served, our glasses always remained full, and we were given different utensils and place settings with the change of a course.\n- Love the unique ingredients and having the chance to try something I typically wouldn't choose for myself.\n\nLow Points:\n- The striped bass dish was a little salty\n- The charred taste was unpleasant for the oyster and could have used more citrus notes.\n\nLowest Point:\nCraigie counts an amuse bouche and pre-dessert as one course.  Might as well call it a 5 course Chef's Whim instead.  Definitely a bit deceiving.\n\nOverall, we left full and happier than our first time here.  I'm happy we were able to give Craigie a second chance and had a much better unique culinary experience,"]
["A great way to celebrate a special occasion. Chef's tasting menu didn't disappoint. I was interested to learn about the Chef's Whim event on Sunday nights. I see that some reviews say 8PM. The website says 9PM though. Pretty late, but I'm interested in trying it one night!"]
["Incredibly slow, poor and inattentive service. I've never walked out of a restaurant before until tonight. At 730 they did not have their core dish for two. An incredible letdown"]
["I was here for the prix fixe - an appetizer, entrée, and dessert for $67. The items were all innovative and mostly delicious, although the service took forever (especially in the beginning with ordering) - it ended up being a 3.5 hour business dinner where the people ran out of steam before the food!\n\n- Little taste - I'm not sure if this is a regular tradition, but the chef gave us a little experimental taste (mine was prosciutto on a fried pork something). It was tasty and I always enjoy those little culinary surprises.\n\n- Squid ink pasta - amazing! The flavors are wonderful and the razor clam is a nice touch.\n\n- Stuffed chicken - the texture of the chicken was wonderful and tender, but the stuffing and sauce didn't have great depth to it.\n\n- Chocolate foie gras mousse - this was delicious and the foie gras added good creaminess to the mousse without adding liverness. That being said, I would have liked to see more unique options beyond the obvious mousses and fruit tarts in every other fancy restaurant.\n\nThe waitress also had good wine recommendations that matched the food well.\n\nOverall, this is delicious food and this place is famous for a reason. But some little aspects of the food or speed of the service could be improved a little."]
["I came here for a birthday dinner. I had high expectations of the place given that it has been rated one of the best burgers in Boston, and to be honest, I was a little disappointed. We arrived early (around their opening time of 5pm) to make sure that we could get a burger since apparently they can sell out by 6 or 7pm. We were seated immediately by a very nice server. We wanted to try a variety of dishes so we ordered a duck confit and mushroom ragout appetizer, Vermont pork 3 ways (roasted loin, spice-crusted rib, and country sausage), the famous Craigie burger, and a salted chocolate mousse with espresso ice cream for dessert. They also had a special side of bone marrow that evening that we ended up trying. \n\nDuck confit and mushroom ragout appetizer: delicious! The ragout was flavorful and the duck pieces were tender and moist. It was served with an over easy egg on top and the runny yolk mixed with the ragout and added to the creaminess. I was very impressed. \nCraigie burger: unfortunately I didn't like the burger very much - maybe my expectations were set to high with the hype. The burger definitely has a unique flavor profile with the mace ketchup and ?horseradish but I felt that the spices were too overpowering. At $18 for the burger I didn't think it was worth it, but I'm glad I tried it.\nVermont pork 3 ways: I was also disappointed by this dish. None of the ways that the pork was cooked stood out to me. I didn't think the flavors worked together very well, and there was too much meat on the dish that wasn't balanced by anything else.\nBone marrow side: this was the highlight of the meal. For $5, we received two huge slabs of bone marrow in the bone. The marrow was gelatinous and fatty and melt in your mouth, perfectly cooked for fatty buttery heaven. \nDessert: this was excellent as well, although I wish the portion was larger for the price. The mousse was lightly salted, balancing both sweet and salty. The espresso gelato paired very well with the mousse, adding coffee notes to the chocolate."]
['Simply the best in Boston. Food, service, cocktails, and atmosphere are all top notch. Craigie is one of those few restaurants where you have a meal and never forget for the rest of your life. The menu explores a wide variety of dishes which display Chef Tony Maws skills to make the best food. Go here and try everything. Also- the jungle bird cocktail is amazing.']
["We ate at the chef's table, with the Ultimate Craigie Experience, and everything was simply amazing. My only gripe is that there isn't a wine pairing (and the selection of wines by the glass isn't particularly extensive -- but they do have a couple of very nice options, so it wasn't the end of the world!)"]
['Overdue review... I read good reviews about this place, but was not impressed when I experienced myself. We got the 6 course menu. \nThey gave us complementary appetizer (three pieces). One of them was okay, didnt really like the other two (mackerel was too fishy for my taste).\nSweet potato latke with pear salad was pretty good, but not exceptional. It tasted like what I expected. I would say my favorite dish was sea bass. It was very soft, not fishy, had good flavor. Eel dish was interesting. I dont think ive ever had this kind of noodle (i think it was rye), but not my liking. I had my boyfriend finish lamb dish, the game smell was too strong and the meat was bit tough....\nDesserts were okay. The apple sorbet tasted like frozen apple sauce, but tasty, refreshing. Pistachio paste/tahini fritter just tastes like reg donut hole. It was good but not special....\nI dont think it was worth the money.....']
["It only takes a minute after you walk in the door to remember why your back here. It's a  comfortable environment, not too loud, not too hectic and with just the right amount of activity to make watching the staff like watching the gears tick in an antique watch. We had the chef's tasting and just loved it as always. It's nice to just put yourself in the hands of a professional staff and then let them drive. Colin took care of us that night and he was great, fun to talk to and helped us with all of our wine parings for the tasting. The rest of the staff from the young lady that greeted us at the door to every person that touched our table that night was friendly, polite and courteous. I could go on and describe every dish and all the amazing flavors but suffice it to say that I cant imagine describing any bite being anything less then perfection."]
['I came here for Craigie\'s version of Dine Out Boston on a Thursday night. No surprise, Craigie still remains my favorite restaurant in Boston.\n\nI opted for the 6-course tasting menu ("Chef\'s Whim), and had:\n\n1. Pork Belly Tartine with frisee and beet puree\n2. Shrimp with scallions, hazelnuts, and blood orange puree\n3. Dover sole with vanilla clams, pea greens, and barley risotto\n4. Veloute with chorizo, turnip, maitake mushroom, kale, and chili oil crumbs\n5. Braised beef short rib with red wine sauce and forked potatoes\n6. Chocolate Decadence Cake with ice cream\n\nEverything on the tasting menu was delicious and cooked to the perfection, and my two favorites were the dover sole and the soup. Will definitely be coming back soon! :)']
['My experience at Craigie started with meeting Jeff Senechal at LCB Boston, he is so passionate about what he does and who he works for.  I had explained to him how much my husband wanted to go to Craigie but I was scared due to my Celiac.  He assured me they would take care of my needs and to just address that when I made the reservation for my husband\'s birthday dinner!\n\nService is beyond anything I have ever experienced before, when Chefs say eating is an "experience" I never got that.  Eating here, I experienced that for the first time in my life!  I posted my burger for any celiacs out there, I got mine without the bun and a fried egg on top!  Dessert was a brown butter cornbread with apple confit, I thought I could have some but it did contain flour in it.  Jeremy brings out DESSERTS, he brought me a salted caramel mousse on the house because he didn\'t want me to go without dessert!  \n\nThank you Jeff, Kaitlin, Jeremy, all of the cooks and chefs at Craigie\'s who work behind the scene for the wonderful meal and experience that we will truly NEVER forget!']
['Went to Craigie last night and the whole experience was wonderful, again. Juan, our server, was knowledgeable, extremely pleasant, and happy to accommodate a vegan diner! What a gem, he is. The cocktails were phenomenal, and each course was perfect. I love this place and will certainly be back. Thank you!']
["3 course Sunday brunch was pretty delicious. Portion size was good. The place was completely booked. The waiter was cool. He came to check on us a few times.  Lots of staff members around, anticipating the crowd. There were a couple of times where food was auctioned and the waiter got a little upset at them because he placed the food with the wrong person. Meredith, Tony Maw's (owner of Kirkland Tap and Trotter) wife was very nice and pleasant with a bubbly personality. \n\nWe had some special needs with the kids (no gluten and non dairy) and the chef was accommodating and may variations of the same foods so the girls could eat too. Mainly, the first course of granola topped with fresh foods and nuts instead of yogurt, second course - no cheese on the burger, and no buns, and 3rd course - one generous scoop each of 3 different sorbets instead of either chocolate decadence cake with white chocolate ice cream or the panna cotta. \n\nI had the pork belly fried in batter with eggs sunny side up and pigeon peas. What a beauty that was. Tasted great. Batter was light and brown. The peas were rich and wonderfully a complied with the eggs. Normally I'm not huge on eggs sunny side up but this was great! The yolk was cooked just about half way so it wasn't too runny. \n\nMy sister had the Smoked Capon and chicken sausage. Amazing dish. Tasty and rich. \n\nMy brother in law has the local grass fed beef burger with steak fries. \n\nI also had the panna cotta and I have to say that it wasn't the best I've had. It was very good but it could be just a to at less liquid would make it perfect. \n\nI also tasted my sister's chocolate decadence cake. I was jealous. \n\nPositive experience. Great atmosphere. Surprisingly wasn't too hard to find parking either (probably because students aren't back yet and it was New Year's Day). Either way, had a great time with family and that's all that matters."]
["They certainly know how to treat folks celebrating a special occasion: service and friendliness extraordinaire by Emilio and others. You can sense the camaraderie.\nAnd, yes, the food: properly chilled, lightly spiced Great Island Oysters; Pennsylvania Dutch Country Chicken with nicely fried chicken leg and flavorful breast that sliced like butter, delicious veggies; Vt. Pork Three Ways, w/ a particularly special rib; quality Miso-Marinated Ribeye w/top-notch sweetbreads/veggie puree; mini tastings of seafood/fish raw and ceviche;  mini entremets of apricot panna cotta and strawberry soups that were over-the-top good; excellent, balanced  Bitter Chocolate Terrine (not that bitter) with caramel corn, and creme fraiche ice cream; and excellent, delicate Sheep's Milk Cheesecake w/sesame-matzoh crust and spiced cherries. Very good bread. And what would Craigie be without Bubbe's Shmaltz thrown into the cooking----and a little bit into Craigie's as well?"]
["The best Restaraunt I've been so far in Boston area. Maybe, Smith &amp; Wallensky can compete with it. It's all about user experience. When you are in Craigie, relax and enjoy the tasting menu - you there will be nothing you won't like or be worried about."]
["Best burger in town! And I've tried other good places. Must order with some of their nice drought beers.\nShould arrive early because they make only 18 burgers per day...and they run out quickly!\nAll ingredients are made in house, including of course their outstanding signature meat putty, but also the bread, and even the side ketchup.\nThe burger is not cheap, but it's worth every penny...\nIf you go by yourself, I recommend sitting at the bar. With your significant other a table might be better.\nOf note, I don't think this is a place to go with children.\nI still need to try their legendary 6- or 8-course dinner."]
["Absolutely amazing. I went for a 1-1 cooking/butchering class, where the chef shows you how to cut lamb chops, yellow fish, and chicken. Even before the class, I thought the experience was worth it when they had us sit at a open bar, where the bartenders were friendly - not to mention the mini appetizers they served. During the class, the restaurant owner talked about his personal philosophy and his reasoning behind getting fresh meat, etc., which was interesting. We then got to try to cut the chicken on our own, and to my surprise, we got to take the chicken home! Doesn't even stop there - we got complimentary gift bags (with a small cutting board and an apron) AND we got a 3 course meal. The 3 course meal included salad with arugula, wrapped chicken with quinoa and beets, and a shortcake with coconut ice cream and raspberries - all of which were absolutely amazing (and tasted healthier because it wasn't too greasy or heavy). This also took place during the day, so the restaurant had a good atmosphere - good lighting and clean, organized tables. Maybe it was the complimentary wine they also served, but I left feeling very satisfied and happy. Looking out for the next event they have!!"]
['The a absolutely most consistent dinner spot in Boston. The bar remains fantastic and the food is fabulous.  I have been frequenting Craigie for five years and it never disappoints, even when I miss the best burger in Boston.']
["This is hands down one of the best dining experiences you will find anywhere.  Unpretentious with a subtle elegance Craigie offers the freshest ingredients with the most creative dishes.  Put yourself in the Chefs hand and go with the tasting menu.  My wife and I do not drink alcohol and when ordering non alcoholic beverages we were not shamed into feeling like second class citizens (which happens frequently at high end establishments unfortunately)  This is also our litmus test for the waiter to see if he earns a 35% tip.  I am happy to say Craig passes the test on many levels!\n\nStaff is friendly, food is fantastic.  Atmosphere is perfect.  Don't hesitate to spend your hard earned money here!"]
['Food was okay, service was excellent, overall experience was decent. For a party of 2, we spent about $221, I left feeling unsatisfied, which is why I gave 3 stars. Would I come back again? Maybe.']
["I was disappointed with the food.i tried the fried clams and the octapus and they were good.  I'm a vegaterian and ended up paying a lot of money for a piece of parsnip. The bread is great."]
['It was wonderful.  The service was great.  The menu alluring and the food was excellent.  The waiter suggested a local IPA, which was also a delight.']
['High quality food, great hospitality, nice ambiance. Elegant and calm reception. Relaxing atmosphere. Very good overall. Central location. Highly recommend it.']
["Huge list of interesting cocktails, flavored with organic  essential oil ... Tasty and delicious....\nWe took the fix menu .... The Burgundy wine was good\n\noctopus as my 1st plate ... One word:wow... I never taste it as good as here.... And the  texture was perfect...\n\nSole fish as my main course: a little bit disappointed... It's 3 bites exactly and they add some kind of stuffing that dominate the fish taste... \n\nPain perdu for dessert... Be aware, nothing to do with the real original french pain perdu, but it was tasty and full of spices and flavors ...\n\nThe waiter was amazingly nice and cute ... \n\nGuys, you better go with a full wallet !!  especially if you wana taste cocktails in the begining followed by some French bottle of wine !!"]
['For some reason, I really wanted this place to have a hearty, old-timey pub feel with candlelight and a convivial atmosphere. I think it\'s the name. It sounds like a place in the heart of an old town that has worn floorboards and has been passed down in the family. The "ie" at the end of "Craig" really hammers that home. Dudes with names that end the same way most pet names do (aww, you\'re a cute little cheffie, you are!) really know how to have a good time. \n\nOR so I thought. \n\nLeave it to Boston to take a place with an adorable pub-by name and make it very modern, very overpriced and rather pretentious. Oh, Boston *sighs*. \n\nIf you want to try to get your date to drop their Chanel panties, or prove to your yachting Uncle that the time spent at Harvard really did help you find your truth, then by all means come here. Remember to wear your cardigan, preferably in a pastel shade. But for people who consider themselves more "white-ish" than "thoroughbred WASP", the groove here may not be your style. Also for mere mortals the check here is hefty. Baby elephant hefty. Entrée prices hover near 40 bucks a plate, apps almost 20, and desserts around 12 bucks. \n\nTHE FOOD: Meh. Good, I guess. The chef clearly cares and is a bit whacky. The kitchen tries some stuff it can\'t really pull off, but that\'s better than not trying. What I had:\n\nTrio of Amuse bouche (free)-Yay, free food! But tiny doll-sized free food. Forgot what they were, mainly tasted fishy. We get it Craigie, you\'re fancy. \n\nCrispy-Fried Essex Clams with preserved lemon, pickled peppers, dried black olive, squid ink anchoïade ($18)\nThe sauce with the fried clams had squid ink, which translated to a dot of intimidatingly black, almost bloody tasting (like if you\'ve had pig\'s blood in a sauce, that deep umami iron-heavy taste) aioli. It was unusual, not bad, but not truly satisfying. I didn\'t feel like I was indulging so much as spelunking in a murky cave of tastebud confusion.\n\nDate and Chicken Sausage-Stuffed Chicken with spiced yogurt, pea tendrils, pea hummus, raisin chermoula($38)\nIt\'s one thing to kill a chicken because it\'s tasty. But then to stuff its sad lifeless carcass with the ground body of another of its feathered friends just seems a bit....rude. It was ultimately an overrated dish. After hearing Boston natives foam at the mouth while talking about it I expected orgasms. But it was not the juiciest chicken I\'ve had. And for almost 40 bucks that needed to be one heck of a better buttered beautiful bird. \n\nSlow-Cooked Artic Char Mi-Cuit with peekytoe crab, quinoa, artichoke barigoule, za\'atar, fennel puree ($38)-Tasted salmon-like to me. Delicately prepared, I liked the dill, and presentation. \n\nPavlova with Strawberry Consommé raspberries, goat\'s milk tapioca, tarragon ice cream ($11)-Favorite dish of the night. Well plated, good colors, and the tapioca provided a nice texture contrast with the merengue and tarragon ice cream. It tasted like a summer dessert should. I should note though that the pastry chef here clearly likes playing with savory flavors in desserts, which can be wildly unsuccessful sometimes (see below).  \n\nWhite Asparagus malted Milk Shake with rhubarb chantilly and graham cookies ($13)-I ordered this to see if they could pull it off. And the answer was no. Not really their fault though. The best case scenario of putting asparagus in a milkshake is the sugar bludgeons the asparagus to the point you can\'t taste it. Otherwise, it just tastes like you tried to sneak more greens into your three year old\'s diet somewhere and in a fit of desperation you liquefied it. In conclusion, all I learned from this is try as you might to make asparagus a dessert, it\'s not a dessert. Don\'t put asparagus in a milkshake y\'all. Points for creativity though?']
['There are not a lot of items on the menu and everything looks so oily. They only have extremely strange items and do not offer any pasta at all. I severely does not recommend it at all.']
['My wife &amp; I celebrated our 30th anniversary by having dinner here. We chose to sit at the counter facing the kitchen. It was wonderful seeing all the chefs and cooks working while we enjoyed our meal. We started off by sharing the octopus and the bone marrow..both delicious! For entrees we shared the salmon and the pork three ways..again both were great. Dessert was a white chocolate parfait..good but not extraordinary. Service was superb..our waiter Colin was friendly and attentive as was the entire staff. I look forward to a seasonal menu change for a return visit.']
["I've waited so long. As Survivor said, the wait is over. But I say, I wish you were with me all along.\n\nIt's been two weeks and I'm still reminiscing about my meal. Well done, CoM. Well done.\n\nWalking into the joint, it's not that impressive. It's fun and somewhat hopping. The bar area is notorious for a virtuoso male of the cocktail behind the bar. He grows, collects, and makes his own bitters, mixers, and flavorings. TIP: please come early and seek him out. You'll know him by the encyclopedic and obsessional tirade about booze once you strike up a conversation. You won't be disappointed. Unless you're a recluse and schizoid. Then I'm sorry but not sorry. Enjoy your artisanal drink made with the utmost love and care in the corner.\n\nAnyways, back to the food/dining:\n\nService was great here. The waitress was as slyly attentive and monitoring of the table as one would expect in a white tablecloth classy joint. Neither intrusive nor too distant. \n\nDrinks: You must try the daiquiris! They aren't the Wild Willy's sort. These are mean drinks in their original boozy nature. After having them, I'm proud to say I would love a daiquiri. When the hell did adding an extra 100g of sugar and 1 lb of ice come into the equation in the past 70-80 years?! Highlight was the Papa Doble -- Hemmingway would be proud. Come to think of it, he's the perfect role model for stating how a daiquiri was (and here continues to be) a noble and fine drink of choice. The Lawyers, Guns, and Money was... money. Drink up. Only the Boogie on Reggae Woman was meh. Yes, I had three daiquiris. Don't judge.\n\nFood: Unfortunately my companion did not want to do the tasting menu. Who comes here and doesn't want the tasting menu?! Not gonna order it (and can't) unless the both of us could. So I chose the $67 option for an appetizer/small dish, main dish, and dessert. Conversely, one could have ordered the chef's choice tasting menu for only $100. I watched the table next to me in envy. Sigh. Note: the chef's choice menu can be made gluten and/or veggie-sensitive as needed.\n\nI ordered the Essex Clams. My god the Essex Clams. Whole body clams, fresh, fried perfectly in a somewhat rough on the tongue but chewy batter. The squid ink anchioade was the piece de resistance: heavily thick dipping sauce. Who the hell needs tartar sauce or clarified butter (if dissing clarified butter doesn't tell you how good this was, nothing will). I'm asking for squint ink anchioade when I go to my next clam shack in the summer instead -- though I'm sure I'll get a dirty/quizzical look. I was skeptical about the preserved lemon, but it just works, man.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Pork Three ways. The rib. Oh, the rib. I know, it's just one rib, right? Savory sweet as all get-out. Fell off the bone tender, too. I'll have one rack, please! Oh wait. Fine restaurant. Only moderate portions. Sorry. Luckily the Porcelet Sausage came to the rescue of my hunger. It's deep umami and somewhat gamey taste was mana from heaven. The pork rolled out of the casing just waiting to be sopped up. Both fresh and cured. I'm still in shock and awe. I kept eating small portions of it and attending to the slow-cooked belly so I could prolong affair. Don't get me the wrong, the belly was good. But rib and sausage were epic.\n\nMy companion had the ragout of locally foraged mushrooms without the pork sausage (vegetarian). I think it was a little too earthy and rustic for her. The pasta was whole wheat and seemed to be comprised of vegetables and other starches (potato?) and is served cold -- very un-Sicillian. Good for me, not her style. It created for a hearty dish and I was glad to finish it for her.\n\nFor desert, I had the malted milkshake. I have to say, it was quite minty and thick. Not a large portion but rich enough that you didn't need it. The graham cracker should have been renamed the crack cracker. I don't know how they made such an incredible combination of crisp cracker with flavorful graham sugar; I'm just glad they did.\n\nScooting away for a mid-$100 check for 4 dishes, 4 drinks ain't bad when the food is this good. I can't wait to go back for the tasting menu."]
['We came here on a Tues night for the special burger. Not the biggest burger fan but I have to say the taste is very original with the right amount of seasoning.']
['I have now been to Craigie over a dozen times in the last few years and thought it was time for an update to my review. I have now been here for numerous meals at the bar (my favorite place to grab a seat), brunches (which. as of this writing they are moving to their sister restaurant Kirkland), and a tasting menu in their formal dining area.\n\nI do prefer dining in their bar area because I\'m usually not in the mood for a big tasting menu and its less formal with more of a cocktail bar feel. The dining area where the tasting menu is ordered is white tablecloth but not overly formal. They also have a 4 top bar that overlooks the kitchen. The kitchen definitely has a "Masterchef" and military-like efficiency to it, these guys are very talented.\n\nThe Burger - Not much to say about this burger that hasn\'t been said. Not only is it one of the best in Boston, it\'s one of the best burgers in America. My only criticism is the homemade ketchup. Maybe I\'m a peasant but I prefer Heinz. Everything else is perfection. You can only order these at the bar area and they have a limited number daily so go early.\n\nRoasted Chicken - One of the best preparation of chicken I have ever had. Often I will think chicken is a boring menu pick, but not here. On my visit it was prepared 3 ways on the place.\n\nBone Marrow - My first experience with bone marrow was at Craigie so don\'t be afraid. It spreads on bread like butter and is similar in a lot of ways. It came flavored with garlic and other spices. A must get item.\n\nHouse made doughnut  - As of this writing this menu item will have retired along with their brunch. It was pretty amazing, the last time I had it, it was topped with caramelized goats milk.\n\nSorbets - Pretty standard but they usually have an interesting trio of flavors. Great palette cleanser at the end of the meal.']
['We wanted to love this place. Close from our house, we were hoping that we could make it our "special occasion" place. Unfortunately, we were more than disappointed by our experience. \nIn short, the food is well executed but lacks creativity and you leave hungry even after a 3-course meal. At the price you\'re paying, we were at least expecting one or the other...\n\nWe had a salad as starter, which was small and simple, the kind you make at home. Not impressed. We then shared the pork 3 ways and the chicken. Both dishes were perfectly executed, the meat was perfectly cooked... but there was really nothing interesting going on in either dishes. The chicken especially was very blend. The pork was a little bit better, but neither dishes felt like something I couldn\'t make at home. We finished with the spiced chocolate tart, which wasn\'t spiced at all, and generally heavy. \nAll this for what was basically a small fortune... $$$$$\n\nThe only plus was the wine, which was surprisingly ok priced and turned out to be excellent. \n\nWe won\'t come back.']
['The bar is the place to be!  The cheeseburger with bacon put our group\'s burger guru in heaven!  The rest of us shared some bar food (carrots with homemade ricotta - yum) and first courses as separates (veloute is perfect to chase away the cold); love that idea of being able to mix and match!  The bartender knew his wines and I got what worked for my palate and my dinner choices - "We want you to be happy", he said.  I can\'t wait to go back for the tasting menu.  Great place for special times, even if that is just not having seen the friends in a while!']
['Cragie on Main has been on my bucket list for several years. Weekend reservations require planning far in advance so the few times I tried to check this place out, it was too late to secure a table. I personally feel that Cragie is something that you should experience on a weekend, simply because those are the best nights. Although the ambiance itself is not fancy, it is more of a celebratory atmosphere. Google describes it as a "high-end restaurant with innovative, French-inspired locavore fare and seasonal tasting menu." When a restaurant is that hyped up, it can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. A blessing because customers are going to go "all out" considering they had to wait months to get a table. It creates a buzz and you feel kinda special when you finally get that prime time reservation. It can also be a curse because expectations are going to be sky high. For the restaurant business, making lots of mula is their primary interest as that is the foundation of remaining lucrative and in business. Most people are happy with just average so most of these types of places don\'t go above and beyond to have the best quality food and service. I would say Cragie on Main fits right into this category. Now let\'s get to the good stuff.\n\nThe Deets: For appetizers, I tried the oysters and the octopus. The oysters were dressed uniquely and were fresh on point. We found it odd that the server did not know exactly where they were harvested. Cape Cod is a large area and as an oyster connoisseur, it would be nice to know if I am slurping a Wellfleet or a Chatham. The octopus was my favorite dish as it was cooked to perfection and the kale and almonds added a nice crunch. Overcooked octopus can be almost as bad as overcooked chicken breast and it is SO easy to make that mistake. A couple of my friends tried the pork three ways and I could see the disappointment in their eyes as they took their first bites. I can\'t comment beyond that as pork is not my cup of tea (unless its bacon of course). For my main course, I had the Maine Dayboat Sea Scallops, which I would describe as "good." Yes that is a boring word choice for an avid Yelp reviewer and trendy French restaurant but it gets the point across that it was nothing special. I would even go as far as to say the scallop dish I prepare at home with a roasted red pepper sauce is tastier than the dish at Cragie on Main. On snap, watch out Chef Tony Maws, Kiki P is on the hunt for your gig. \n\nOverall, I can\'t say that I was impressed by the cuisine, service and ambiance at Cragie on Main. At the same time, I wouldn\'t say that I was disappointed. I found everything about the restaurant to be average. The quality of food was good and I enjoyed all of the dishes that I tried. The desserts were along the same lines but nothing unique or special. As for value, this place averages to at least $100/person if you do the 3-course prix-fixe with 1 drink. I understand the dining landscape of the city of Boston fairly well and I can confidently say that I could have had a similar meal with the same level of satisfaction for about half the price. Cragie on Main is a solid restaurant but I don\'t see the value in being a frequent visitor at the establishment.']
["Pig head basically makes this worth flying accross country for, so simple, so perfectly executed. Takes a while but that's not an issue as a high interest wine program, great bread and some awesome apps will keep you occupied. Definitely worth a visit."]
["Craigie on main does pork so well! The pork three ways is a definitely must get! the fried clams is a little underwhelming. The octopus is very good. The chocolate tart is decadent. But the tahini beignets didn't quite appeal to me, however if you like spiced Mexican chocolate -ish taste you might enjoy it."]
['Fresh from Yelp\'s Burger Binge Week in Seattle and Chicago, KL and I embarked on a mission to find the best burger in Boston. Craigie on Main was recommended to me by a friend of a friend, and it was a recommendation not to be missed. The burger isn\'t on the menu, but may be requested as an entree. CoM only makes 18 burgers each night, so arrive early for this well-crafted burger. \n\nWe started the night with booth seating near the bar, and were given the choice of sparkling (complimentary) and still water. Water service was on-point, and our glasses were consistently refreshed. KL and I ordered the burger, but were encouraged to look at the menu. We opted to try the octopus (octopus with KL is a trend), and weren\'t as impressed with the appetizer. The octopus was done too well, and we missed the tender and flakiness of the octopus meat. \n\nThe burger, though, was on point and stole the show. KL and I have had the single burger at Au Cheval, which Bon Appetit named the best burger in America. I have had the burger three times in a two week period. Its good, it really is, but CoM does their own thing and its more to my liking than Au Cheval. KL tacked on a fried egg and thin and crispy bacon. The burger comes with a thick slab of meat patty, the freshness of which is indisputable. There is a side of greens and potato wedges, with chives. Yes, chives. Boston loves their chives. There are three sauce/side accouterments, including pickles, that are served separately and are replenishable (like Korean BBQ). \n\nIn addition, we received a complimentary ham and trout belly "taste." Loved the trout belly, and KL loved her ham. Its like they knew which one of us would go for what taste. \n\nOverall, this burger is Boston\'s best. Its fresh, juicy, tender, and meaty, but its also flavorful, and that makes it stand out.']
["Perfectly decent food, but too expensive for what it was. I had the mushroom and potato ragout to start and the grass-fed sirloin as my main. My husband had the squid ink pasta to start and the pork three ways as a main. I found all to be good, but nothing incredible. \n\nThe service was kind, but a bit awkward. We were at a table near a big beam, so the servers were constantly going around the beam to serve the table next to ours (they ordered the tasting menu, so they had a ton of dishes to be served and cleared). \n\nI'm meh on Craigie."]
["Wonderful tasting menu last Saturday night. The bass kama was amazing. The lamb really seemed to melt in my mouth, to lean on a tired cliche. The street corn was too damned good. The desserts... well, at this point I'm out of superlatives. Thank you for a fantastic dinner."]
['Mixed experience. We came here for dinner. The food overall had very good flavor. However the service was mediocre at best. When the waiter brought over the wine he mixed up two of the wines. Giving a sample of one wine but pouring a different wins into the glass. To start we had the oysters, eggplant and octopus. The octopus was some of the best I have ever had. The oysters and eggplant were very good. After our appetizers one of the people ordered another glass of wine. After about 30 minutes the wine still had not come. I reminded the server that we were still waiting for it and he brought it over shortly and said the wine would be removed from the bill. Finally our food arrived. Two of us had Arctic char which was very good. The other two had the pork 3 ways. The flavor was amazing however the food was room temperature. No one came over to check on our food. After we finished the waiter came over to clear the plates and we asked if the food was to be served at room temperature. He said the fish was to be slightly above but the pork was supposed to warm. He told the manager but the manager never came over to see how it was. We then ordered the creme Carmel and white chocolate parfait for dessert. Both were very good. When we got the check the restaurant had comped our desserts because of the issue with had with the food but did not take off the one glass of wine. We said something and they then adjusted the check. Although the food was very good the service was externally disappointing and the fact that the food was not warm make me not want to return any time soon. For a resturant of this caliber I was expecting much better service.']
["Came here for the chef's whim with a group of friends at 9pm on Friday. The place was pretty booked at that time and we were seated at an elevated table near the open kitchen which was pretty nice and gave us pretty good view of the kitchen and what the chefs are preparing.\n\nWe opted for the 4-course, started with one single complimentary oyster which was fresh (could are a dozen!). \nThe First course was tomato salad which basically just three wedges of tomato, I was a little bit disappointed about this, nothing particular and since originally I thought this was our second course, I was even upset(turned out I was wrong). \nThe second course is grilled octopus, still, portion is small just a tiny tail but it's pretty tender and flavorful. \nThird savory was pork in three ways which was the highlight! the pork belly was so good! Also, we got a bonus fried clams which was crispy and fresh(not sure if it's because I was complaining the portion is small loll). We finished the dinner with a mint flavor icecream. \nOverall my friends and I were satisfied with the dinner and although portion was small, with everything plus the bread we were pretty full. I would give four star to the food(five to the pork in three ways), the food was not mind-blowing creative but it's still decent good, wish their bread would be better. Plus 4course for $45, that's a steal.\nFive-star for sure to the service, very attentive and knows how to beat our expectation. (There bonus fried clams did the job!)"]
['This is a review based on my experience only.  I\'m sure plenty of people have had great experiences, but for me this was not.  With that being said, this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had (bad enough for me to create a yelp account just so I can do this review).  \n\nIt seems like the restaurant is split into two sections offering two different menus (if you want the burger you need to opt for the bar/darker lit section of the restaurant).  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant definitely set the mood for a nice evening.  Definitely the type of place you could take a date and enjoy conversation.\n\nThe drink menu provides plenty of choices from beer to cocktails.  As far as the dinner menu goes you pretty much have to choose between a prix fixe of 3, 6, or 8 courses.  My girlfriend and I chose the 3 course.  \n\nWe started off with the octopus and pig tails since it seemed like the most popular dishes there.  They were both okay.  If you\'re not a fan of octopus I wouldn\'t let that lead you away from ordering it since it\'s prepared more like a protein than seafood.  The pigtails were good, but since they\'re so fatty it\'s hard to eat more than 2.\n\nFor the second course we ordered the stuffed chicken and pork three ways (rib, sausage, and something else I couldn\'t quite identify).  The chicken was moist but nothing spectacular.  It was stuffed with some sort of sausage but it had a taste and texture that I was not a fan of.  The pork dish also was nothing exceptional - I completely avoided the sausage since again the taste and texture seemed off to me which I let the waiter know.  They ended up giving me another rib for my trouble- which I was grateful for but couldn\'t really eat any more of.\n\nFor the third course we had the beignets and a pear/sorbet.  It was definitely the best part of the meal.  I\'d strongly suggest the beignets.\n\nAlthough I\'m tempted to give the place 1 star I think such a rating would be unfair.  The effort to innovate and service definitely exists at this restaurant (the kitchen was cooking up different tastes and dishing it out to patrons for sampling), but in terms of execution (at least for my group) it simply wasn\'t there.  For example, a waitress just dropped off our second course without saying anything.  I wasn\'t expecting her to say "enjoy" or anything but a description of the dishes would have been appreciated.  The food itself wasn\'t anything spectacular, and for this price point I would recommend going to Bistro Du Midi instead.  The dishes here certainly have a wide flavor profile but I think it falls short of some of the other fine dining options in the Boston area.']
["What is Craigie on Main?  After dining there recently, I'm still not sure.  I'm awarding CoM 4 stars, but I really think it should get 3.75 - 3 is far too too cruel, 4 is, well... a bit much. Impressions below.\n\nThe Decor - the tables have white paper over linen, half the place is a bar, and it is loud.  So as a guest paying $$$$, this is the presented scenario.  Is this novel and quirky, or simply insulting?  Both, I guess. \n\nThe Staff - The kitchen is all men, most of the waitstaff is women. Why - is this part of the Craigie on Main show, the image to be portrayed? Noticeable, and weird.  The kitchen facilitator (a man) is ebullient about announcing the incoming orders and the dishes to be prepared.  This was fun at first.  The waitress announced that the establishment provides 'free water' and I almost laughed... was I supposed to laugh?  There was a bit of obvious upsell when we ordered, embarrassing.\n\nThe Food - Everything is very good, sometimes stepping into greatness but not staying there.  Many items are on par with other quality establishments but the set and setting are off.  As such, the food must singlehandedly carry you through the din to nirvana and it just can't, it's not that good (is any food other than mom's pot roast up to that task? I doubt it.)  Lots of talk about how we are about to eat 'the best things we've ever had' and this seems to be a meme, they have this burger, etc.  We admired their confidence but rejected the premise out of hand and we were correct. This is awkward, seems a bit young.\n\nThe Bill - Well, too much, but I didn't particularly regret paying it.  The prix fixe menu seems to be a transparently clever way to sell a tasty chicken for $70.  \n\nOverall -  I think Craigie could be a 'resident trap'; if you have lived in Boston for any length of time you know about this place, and you may feel that you should eventually go here, and I guess you eventually should.  It took us 10 years and... we are glad we went.  We also won't be returning, because it's not the kind of place that requires a return visit."]
["I came here strictly for the burger... We got here right when they opened for dinner and was quickly seated at the bar. I ordered the burger and I think right after we put in our order they were out of burgers for the night. So be sure to come early if you want to get the burger! \n\nThe service was nice - the bartender checked up on us often and was quick to refill our drinks! \n\nNow on to the burgers... they were so delicious! The patty was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It's also huge! I think I ate half of it and was full... The large potato wedges were also seasoned well... Even though they were thick, they were still cooked well. \n\nThe burger was delicious and I would come back if I was in the area!"]
["We ran about 20 mins late for our Friday dinner reservation.  Fortunately, they didn't cancel on us.  Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by friendly hosts.  Got our jackets checked in.  With the open kitchen in the middle of the restaurant - one can't help but gaze over to see what dishes were going onto the line up and wonder will that be something I'll be having tonight.\n\nWe decided to start off with a cocktail.  None of the liquor was familiar to us.   Our server, Emily, was kind enough to explain and recommend some drinks to us.  We decided to try the full 8 course tasting menu (@ $118pp) and ordered 1.5 bottles of wine.  We informed Emily of our dietary restrictions (1 pescatarian, 1 pescatarian+bird and 2 no restrictions).  I'm the pescatarian+bird (eat all things that swims and flys).  \n\nI would say the entree highlights for me were the cooked fish dishes (poached local cod and spanish grey).  Both fishes were cooked to perfection - I never had such well cooked fish.  The low lights were the back to back poached egg dishes (one would had made it memorable enough) and the dessert round (though interesting (i.e. basil seeds and tarragon ice cream) wasn't exactly what I would consider satisfying to the sweet tooth).\n\nThe service was impeccable - Emily and other staff were attentive to us throughout the night without being instrusive to our dining experience and conversations.  One of my girlfriends (bday girl) didn't like one of her course and they offered to give her something else.  As a far-fetched attempt, my girlfriend asked if she can try the bone marrow and they agreed!  At our request to help us remember what we for our courses - they printed our tasting menu for each of us to take home.  When we were about to leave - Emily asked if she can get our jacket tickets so we won't have to wait long for them to retrieve our jackets.  \n\nMy only recommendation is adding moderately priced wines to the wine list - think most or all the bottles start from $100+. Given this was a special ocassion (we broke our piggy banks)."]
["This was some of the best food I've ever had. Incredible combinations of flavors in simple, elegant presentation. The wait staff was attentive and helpful without being overbearing, and made excellent recommendations based on our preferences. Despite the very high quality, the atmosphere was not too formal or stuffy.\n\nI'd go here every week if I could afford to! It's definitely pricy, but it would still have been worth it at twice the price. This will be my go-to for any special occasion."]
["I travel a lot.  I looked forward to eating here during my entire stay.  I finally got to eat here on my last evening.  I chose the chef's choice.  I was not disappointed.  To date, this was one of the few meals in my 46 years that I could count on one hand as being completely memorable. This was one of my top five dining experiences."]
['First time Boston visitors! This place was recommended by a friend and did not dissapoint fussy New Yorkers :) we love to eat and explore new flavors so we went with tasting menu ( 5 courses plus one addition) Everything was delicious, beautifully plated. Great service, amazing cocktails. Even bread basket we finished to the last crumb. We left in a happy food coma. What a gem! Wish we lived closer- would love to dine there more often.']
['Enjoyed a fantastic meal at the chefs table, accompanied by excellent service.']
["Craigie can never go wrong in my eyes. From the casual burger at the bar, to the drinks, the entrees, desserts, best staff and chef! You are my favorite! Will always come back to the chef's table to admire your work up close."]
["This update is long overdue. We were here about 3 weeks ago and everything about craigie blew me away.\n\nWe were seated immediately upon arrival where I (of course) checked into Yelp. Our waitress walked right over, and immediately apologized about our first experience here. She understood that we loved everything about craigie except for the excruciatingly long wait. \n\nDinner service was stellar. The manfriend and I were each served a different amuse bouche which were fitting of our apps. We ended up trading since he wasn't a fan of octopus (shhhhh don't tell anyone).\n\nThe oysters were fantastic, and the foie gras were both fantastic. Manfriend was envious of my choice for foie gras..definitely get that if it's available.\n\nUnfortunately we missed out on the burger again but the sous vide salmon was AMAZING, and manfriend loved his bleeding steak. The reminder that we were at a restaurant with tablecloths was the only thing that kept us from licking our plates. \n\nDessert was my turn to be jealous. I did not go for the fritter recommendation a chose the pain perdue--delicious but the fritters were SO bomb.\n\nOur waitress came over before we left and again apologized, told us she never forgets a face, and that she looked forward to seeing us again. It wasn't a presumptuous statement. We WILL be back :)"]
["Ever been eating something and wondered why you are spending 50 dollars on it?  That was my entire impression of Craigie.  I just spent the whole meal wondering what justified the cost.  The food was alright, but nothing special.  I had a pork dish and my date had some vegetarian option.  Both looked like something you could get elsewhere for less than 20 dollars.  The service was good, but they didn't help recommend a top dish.  I often rely on wait staff to guide me to their favorites, but our waiter wouldn't help.  He said he hadn't tried any of the dishes on the menu that night."]
["An early dinner reservation was a must, so that we could ensure the availability of the most spectacular dish on the menu:\n\nConfit of Milk-Fed Pig's Head - half a suckling pig's head, gorgeous browned &amp; crispy skin, with a layer of unctuous fat, &amp; then tender pork (&amp; then bone, &amp; TEETH!).  Served with a lightly nuoc mam-tasting dressed salad of bean sprouts, shredded kabocha squash, &amp; cilantro, hoisin sauce &amp; freshly house-made tortillas for making into your own piggy soft tacos.  Yum!  I admit that peeling back the face &amp; seeing teeth threw me a bit, even more than seeing the eyeball come out of the socket as it clung to the skin.  \n\nThe face took about 45 minutes to prepare, so we tried the Pig Tails as an appetizer first.  Served in pieces like wings, to be eaten with your fingers, &amp; dipped in the vinegary nuoc mam sauce.  A fluff of super thin onion strings topped the tails &amp; cilantro leaves were the perfect garnish.  Yum!\n\nAfter a porky meal like this, the only dessert I could handle was a digestif.  Fernet did the trick tonight, cutting through all the porky fat &amp; settling my tummy.\n\nThough their 3-course, 6-course &amp; 8-course tasting menus looked tempting, &amp; you could choose the pig face as an entree, I cannot imagine having room to eat anything more than what I ate tonight.\n\nDo yourself a favor &amp; get the tails &amp; the face!  Just don't look at the teeth underneath : /."]
['Excellent food and excellent service. Get the tasting menu and enjoy the ride. Very well done.']
["All I have to say is PHENOMENAL!! I surpised my husband here for dinner on his 30th birthday, and it was everything we imagined it would be and more. We had the first seating and when we arrived a few minutes early, the line was already out the door. We were seated after a few minutes (I highly recommend making a reservation). We were seated in the room to the left, which seemed to be a bit quieter than the room containing the bar. Our server was wonderful! She was friendly, attentive and guided us in all of our decisions. The drink menu was extensive, and I enjoyed a glass of wine while my husband got a tasty mixed drink. We went for the 6 course tasting menu ($98 per person) and it was well worth it. I am not a huge fan of pork, and after letting the server know, the chef was able to accommodate all of my courses. It was an incredible meal! Our first course was three small bites consisting of octopus rillette, bass tartare, and razor neck clam. All were cool and refreshing with a nice taste. Our second course was Spanish mullet tartare on a walnut puree topped with chopped walnuts and pomegranate seeds. This course was sweet, salty and just delicious! Course 3 was seared blue fin tuna on a spinach puree, with crones, celery, and Manila clams. Words can't even describe how delicious this dish was, and all the flavors worked together wonderfully!  The fourth course was Pigs Blood whole wheat pasta with boudin noir pork ragout, which my husband loved. Since I preferred to not have pork, my fourth course was presented as Spacatelli with pea shoots, carrots and spring peas. I have to say, the pasta was some of the best homemade I have EVER had! Our fifth course was venison leg, matsuke mushroom, and baked apple, beet, pork and venison sausage. The venison was tender, slightly salty and cooked perfectly..slightly rare. Our intermezze was maple sorbet with oat crumble and olive oil, and was the perfect thing to cleanse our pallet before our final course was presented. Our dessert was served as mocha mousse with cocoa nibs, caramel ice cream, and chocolate cookie crumble- out of this world!!! We were also served mountain mint milk shake with spiced cookie which was oh so delicious! I can't say enough about how amazing our meal was, how perfect the ambience was and how attentive our server was. We will definitely be back!"]
['Amazing. Truly inspired food. You will leave fully satisfied and with much to talk about! \n\nThe first time I came here, I had the 8 course tasting menu and it was phenomenal. I loved how each course had its own personality and was complex but not over powering such that you wouldn\'t have room for the rest of the courses.\n\nThis review, though, is mostly about my most recent experience with the a la carte menu.\n\n1. pig tails - asian flavored with surprisingly delicious and crispy onion rings. the pig tails themselves are finger-licking good, literally\n\n2. whole wheat "shell" pasta - soooo good. I also enjoy a pasta that is rich but in a flavor way instead of a creamy way. This pasta was wonderfully savory and had a great variety of flavor notes\n\n3. whole pig\'s head - the meat just falls off the bone. Also, even if you avoid the layer of fat, the meat underneath is still exceptional. The hoisin sauce and veggies on the side help to balance out the richness of the meat. The thin wrappers were also a perfect balance of texture.\n\n4. strawberry rhubarb pavlova - I\'m not a huge pavlova fan but this dessert was really fun. There were all sorts of different textures and I really liked the subtle but suiting tarragon flavor.']
["This review is for brunch. i don't get the hype??\n\nShared the pork belly grilled cheese and hash dishes with a friend because we both wanted to try both and could not decide!\nWe were hungry so we shared the chocolate donut and it was YUMMY! nice and warm.\nThe main dishes though, were a little too greasy for me. the pork belly in the grilled cheese was literally all just a slab of fat. the cheese was good though. i did not like the potato wedges. \nThe hash was pretty good! lots of flavor! it came with a piece of buttered bread.\n\nIf I had the hash alone, it probably would have been fine, but that plus the grilled cheese .. was way too much grease. the little pickles that came on the side.. i devoured that in order to balance the heavy greasiness of the dishes.\n\noverall, it's SUPER cute inside and really good service. but i don't understand the hype. the food was just way too greasy and heavy for me."]
["Awesome brunch. \n\nA complimentary chocolate donut with chocolate sauce was offered, which was a nice touch with my morning coffee.\n\nI got the Grilled Two Cheese and Roast Pork Sandwich with a fried egg. This was one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've had (and I've eaten a lot). There was a perfect balance between the crunchy bread and the soft gooey cheesy deliciousness and tender pork. The crispy fries were also very yummy (a favorite of mine now!) \n\nThe burger was good but was a bit too peppery. There are better ones out there. \n\nIt did seem like we were waiting for our food for a long time. Portions were good and the food was plated nicely. Our server was very friendly."]
['We had the prefix menu and everything was great. Good service of course and nice atmosphere. We had the fried pig tail, an amazing risotto and the ribeye but the best dish was the swordfish. I would definitely go back.']
["O.M.G. - I died and went to heaven. One of my top 10 meals of all time, ALL TIME. \n\nI came here for my birthday and everyone from the host to the server made a point to make my experience extra special. I got the six course tasting menu with wine pairing and my only regret is that I didn't get the eight course tasting menu instead.\n\nI started my evening with a monkfish liver pate and salmon roe amuse bouche, followed by red snapper sashimi with a beet, watermelon radish, and grapefruit salad. Then Spanish duran a la plancha with oyster broth and chestnut flour pasta with ragu and parm. The dessert was absolutely to die for. The almond ice cream with cranberry orange blossom and toasted almonds was not too sweet and had delicious roasted almond flavor. It tasted like a Chinese almond cookie.\n\nThe wines were perfectly paired. I'm not sure I loved the wines by themselves but with the food, it was absolutely phenomenal. One of the priciest meals I've had to date but on Sunday evenings after 9, the tasting menu is chef's whim. I am most definitely coming back!"]
['One star?  I know it might seem harsh, but cold over-cooked eggs with bland hash and oily potato strings is not a good breakfast by any measure.\n\nLet\'s start with "Phantom Gourmet", the television show that I can only surmise takes bribes to write reviews.  I have gone to nearly a dozen restaurants over the past four years based on Phantom reviews and I can assure you they have no relation to the actual quality of the food or service.  This place is rated as the best brunch in Cambridge by the Phantom, but I would contend you would be better off eating donuts from 7-11 than going here, or maybe just skipping the meal all together.\n\nOkay, so that was a bit strong.  The food is made for Facebook/Instagram folks.  It\'s very pretty and the plating was nice.  For the 15 seconds I saw the food coming to the table I was very pleased.  That was the highest point of the experience.  The coffee was okay but oily, like it had sat out and been re-heated (this needs to be said as that is a key part to any brunch in my eyes).  I know someone out there is going to argue "You just don\'t know good coffee!"  Well, maybe.  I\'ve been at MIT for 4 years killing myself with the stuff and I know what I like.  I drink coffee everyday, 3-6 cups of it, and I drink it from almost anywhere I can buy it, and never have I had such a gross cup of the stuff, that is except for when I make the mistake of re-heating it in a microwave, and surprisingly that is exactly what this tasted like... \n\nI ordered the hash, thinking it would be a nice simple meal.  I need to state that I have a deep love for diner corned beef hash, it is to me simply the best hangover/drinking food known to man.  What came to my table was a concept of hash (meat+potatoes) redesigned by an art school freshman thinking that piling things on  top of each other made them better tasting.  Served in a pristine white bowl with ~1/2 the total food volume consisting of deep-fried shoestring onions.  These "onion rings" were incredibly chewy and greasy, I had to use a knife to cut through them so that I didn\'t end up dragging the whole woven mess onto my shirt (which was pretty difficult due to the bowl they were all piled in).\n\nThe egg was stark white, the yolk was a hard yellow disk of jelly.  It was prepared over easy I guess (until that point I hadn\'t realized that they did not ask me how I wanted it, I would have said over easy, but still).  It\'s pretty easy to cook eggs so they\'re hot when they reach the table, so it was a real surprise to bite into a cold egg, especially one so over-cooked as to have a solid yolk.\n\nIt ended up a good thing that the yolk was so hard though, as the "toast" they put in front of me was the hardest, most stale and oil soaked brick of bread I have ever touched.  This toast would have made great breadcrumbs.  I however made the mistake of biting into it only to find it wedged around my teeth gouging the roof of my mouth.  With greasy oil dripping from my hand I had to rip the bread out of my face (weird phrasing, but this bread was epic bad!).  As an aside here, they didn\'t ask me what type of toast either.  I usually go for wheat or rye.  This was an italian bread, very airy with an incredibly tough crust.  Not really appropriate for breakfast foods.\n\nNow for the hash!  Is it hash if home fries touch steak?  Is it hash if french fries rub up to ham?  No.  Hash is a delicate mix of meat and potato and spice that makes a man\'s mouth water and is belly rejoice.  What they made was a mix of fancy sounding meat (tongue and cheek, literally those parts) with skillet fried potato cubes.  That was it.  No co-mingling or mashing or flavor swapping.  Just a stack of small fried cubed potato with some flecks of fancy meat.  The meat was basic in flavor.  Cheek is supposed to be very tender, but the way they had prepared it made it dry and flaky.  The tongue was chewy with some serious browning on the edges.  The size and shape of the meat and potato medley made it such that I had to skewer a few pieces at a time by fork to eat them.  2 pieces of potato, 1 piece meat, chew, swallow, repeat.\n\nI tried to work in the egg, that was like wrangling a rubber tire with a pitchfork.  Oh, and those damned onion rings.  They didn\'t go with anything.  By the time I was half way through with them I was having to chug the dank coffee to get the greasy feeling down my throat.  I ended the meal about half way through the food, which is really impressive when you consider the whole lot of it was probably the size of my fist, making it the smallest brunch I have ever been served.  \n\nI paid my bill (~$29 after $5 tip, that\'s for only 1 person too) and walked out.\n\nIn summary, this was the single worst brunch I can recall having.\n\nTL;DR  -  Bad hash, bad coffee, not worth it.\n\nOriginal posted 9/11/2014.']
["The truth is that Craigie on Main is just another restaurant that has been over-hyped by Yelp.\nI came here a little over a year ago and had a mediocre experience but thought it must have just been an off-night. I found myself coming back to try the burger, which is regarded as one of Boston's best. This could not be further from the truth. Finally, I visited a third time for dinner to be completely certain and it was obvious that this was just another restaurant that has gotten far too many five-star ratings, which has contributed to its hype. 3 visits, 3 lackluster meals."]
["I couldn't even last a whole year without returning. The fond memory of that night passes through my mind several times a month, especially when comparing other restaurants, though sometimes I just daydream about it.\n\nAnywho, we went back, but this time to try their apps and entrees. Holy guacamole, the octopus app was the best octopus I've ever had in my entire life without question. It was like some sort of better lobster...yeah. Grilled, charred, and tender, it was everything you'd want from a piece of meat. And them suckers didn't sucker me one bit.\n\nThe other star was the squid ink pasta app. Extremely flavorful, that's all I can say about it because my fork was denied entry many times.\n\nThe main courses were still great, but they were less stellar. Pork three ways and bluefish were pretty darn good, just not as good. For my money, I'd get two apps for the same price as one main course because the mains are more or less the same size.\n\nBut oh man, I may be daydreaming about that octopus for another year."]
["One of the best restaurants in Cambridge Mass and one of the best in the Boston  area. The tasting menu is delightful and smorgasbord of local ingredients that highlight the local flavors while adding traditional french cooking elements. The restaurant has a fun and busy vibe and with an open kitchen you feel close to the action. Service is wonderful, the bread is fresh and delicious, the drinks are served and made to perfection (ask for a Penicillin, oh so good) and the BURGER! My God it's amazing!!! If you don't get it you'll be sorry. But be quick! It runs out in the first 2 hours of dinner service."]
["Very, very good. There's a hype about Craigie On Main and the hype is real. The service is extremely attentive as it should be at an upscale restaurant. The menu is both interesting and tasty. My boyfriend and I eat out at many upscale restaurants in the Cambridge/Boston area and this one is at the top of our list. Highly recommend!"]
["It was the first huge snowstorm of 2013.  It was in fact still heavily snowing when I left for Craigie.  I was glad I journeyed through the foot of snow to get to Craigie.  Inside, I was first greeted by the hostess, standing in front of the open kitchen bustling with activity.  I was quickly taken to my table, where the Lady of the Table was patiently waiting. \n\nCraigie quickly replenishes the bread basket, so be careful to not fill yourself up on it!  We had the six course chef's tasting menu with the theme around fish.  Overall, I thought most (not all) of the dishes were great.  Tony even came out of the kitchen to bring us our last dish.  As with most restaurants though, I thought the dessert was so-so.  Regardless, I will definitely return."]
['Perfectly shucked oysters and a killer wine list. Great ambiance, great service - do it.']
["Overrated and overpriced. \n\nThe bread that they served at the beginning was rock hard; my dad didn't even eat it because it was like chewing through a rock. I started off with the oysters and they were incredibly bland. They weren't the regular saltwater/lemon oysters. I am not sure how to describe them except that they were flavorless with a hint of parsley, and they were $3 a piece! I think the other appetizers that my family ordered were better (such as the mussels or the octopus). I got the steak for my entree and there was nothing memorable about it. My dad got the fish, and it was too salty/boring. The portions were small and left me starving. For a $500 meal (amongst the 5 of us), I would have expected something stellar. However, nothing about this restaurant made me wanting to come back for more."]
["Even though I lived just a minute walk from here, I was very apprehensive about going due to the price tag. So I thought drinks would be cheaper, and they are, at around $11 - $14 per drink. I went on a Saturday for cocktails, and the restaurant and bar area were already packed by the time I got there at 7 pm. Don't expect people to leave too soon either, this is the sort of place where people take their time after sitting down. In the future, I would go early, or better yet, make reservations. My friend and I took a standing room spot, but it was essentially along a bannister in the hallway right after you enter the restaurant towards the bar area, so not the best place to be for ambiance, but the service was great and I appreciate that they accommodated us even though they had many patrons already. \nThey did run out of highball glasses, and substituted another for the drinks we ordered. The drink was delicious, EXTREMELY strong (love me a good deal!) and clearly well made. \nI did not have any food, but it sounds like people have had incredible food experiences here. When I want to drop some dollars, this will be at the top of my Cambridge wish list."]
["We had the prix fixe menu the day before Valentine's Day. The portions were of a reasonable size if they were serving more than three courses and the food had an interesting assortment of flavors that were matched well. The oysters were quite good, as was the vegetable and seafood pasta. The lamb was underwhelming but good.\n\nHowever the seating was appalling. The area in which we sat was freezing to the point where I could not properly enjoy the food. I, and tables around us, were freezing. Totally unacceptable for any restaurant."]
["This was my third time at Craigie.  My experience this time around was 5 star, but I can't say my other experiences have been as amazing so I am settling at 4.  Came here the night of the blizzard for the chef's whim and had a fantastic meal.  \n\nStarted with a cocktail, a wonderfully bitter wintery punch, and a duck pate.  Followed by clams, lamb 2 ways (one of the best dishes I have had at any restaurant in a long time) and a chocolate dessert with vanilla ice cream. My date got an apple fritter dessert - it was like they knew what each of us liked!\n\nService was excellent.  Never felt rushed - our server had great suggestions on wine and was very pleasant.  It was a very nice meal.  \n\nI think I've found my go to inclement weather restaurant.  I also want to go back to try some of the other cocktails as there were a few interesting ones on the menu."]
['After Oleana, best restaurant in Cambridge. Their menu changes often, and always has something delicious for everyone. Their roasted chicken for 2 is solid. Their soups are great, too. Last time I had an artichoke cream soup that was fantastic. They also do a good job with their octopus. The space is chic casual, and service is always good. Top in Boston.']
["Food: 4 Stars\nService: 4 Stars\n\nI've only been to Craigie for their late night menu so I can't speak for the tasting menu and sit down dining experience. My girlfriend and I wanted to drop by for desserts and took a seat at the bar to do so. \n\nThis was later in the evening (around 10 or 11) so apparently there was a late night menu being offered at the bar which included small plates so we thought we might as well have some! I ordered the Funky Bone which was a very unique dish where you could taste the bone marrow. And she ordered the tomato toast which was crunchy and delicious as well.\n\nAfterwards, we got the panna cotta which was quite nice, but didn't match up to the two tapas we got. In addition, we were offered complimentary bread and butter which was delicious. Definitely a steal in terms of value and glad we got to also try some of their food items. Next time we'll be back for the actual tasting menu!"]
["Poor vegans, all these great tasting menus and they usually get left out of the action.  Across the river, we enjoyed a fine dining experience that hit all the right notes, but one: flavor.  It turns out that their vegan menu is the same as the regular option, but the meat is just left off the plate.  As the chef told us later on the tour, 'Oh, that dish is much better with the bacon.'\n\nDon't worry, across the Charles, at a restaurant known for its pig head and bone marrow, there's an outstanding vegan tasting menu.  You do have to give them two-days notice, but it's worth it. \n\nWe were warmly greeted and quickly seated in the stylish dining room.  The open kitchen is central to the restaurant just as the food is the star at Craigie.  The vegan menu is unique each night based on what's available, but I'll mention a few dishes to give an idea of what to expect.  \n\nOur meal started with a trio of amuse bouches, which included crispy brussel sprouts with green apple; kale salad with pickled garlic; and oyster mushrooms and tahini dressing.  Each was artfully presented and a hint of what was to come.\n\nAfter a hearts of palm dish, we were served carrots roasted and spiced with urfa.  I'm not the biggest carrot fan, but this preparation gave it a taste almost like like a roast and it was absolutely delicious!  \n\nOne of the cooks then came out and showed us the roasted cauliflower in its pot and then took it back to the kitchen to be sliced.  Cooked with savory chilies and savory granola, this dish was also outstanding.  \n\nA serving of beet pasta was fine, but we really enjoyed the yukon gold potato served atop forest mushrooms and turnip puree.  Roasted butternut squash and marfax beans was another pleasing course with black garlic vinaigrette, charred leeks and bok choy.  The bok coy didn't seem to fit, but it was otherwise quite tasty.  \n\nThe first dessert was lemon sorbet served over basil seeds, which served as a nice palate cleanser.  The orange blossom and mango dessert with citrus and carrot was truly exceptional. \n\nThe service was very friendly and not at all pretentious.  The staff was clearly knowledgeable about the food they were serving and were great about answering questions.  Also, the servings were nicely spaced, which is something other restaurants struggle with on occasion.  There were a few small things that raised eyebrows, but that didn't take away from the superb food.  At one point our waiter answered a question and said, 'But you probably would only care about that if you were a crazy Whole Foods person.'  Umm, at these prices, most people here are probably crazy Whole Foods people.  The birthday candle came out after dessert on a glass plate with our caramels, probably a bit of an afterthought.  If you're looking for wines by the glass, check the cocktail list. The wine list only includes bottles, so you might miss the by-the-glass option like we did.\n\nOh well, those are all very minor details and we were very happy with our experience and the hostess was particularly helpful.  It's only because she got us a printout of our servings that I remembered so many of the ingredients in our dishes.\n\nThe vegan tasting menu at Craigie is an excellent option for vegans and non-vegans alike.   Go ahead and make your reservation and get ready to be impressed!"]
["Excellent meal and the service was outstanding. Pricey but worth it. We went for my son's 30th bday and we totally enjoyed the entire meal from the time we were promptly seated until the very last forkful of dessert. Highly recommend."]
["The best thing in this restaurant is the service it's AMAZING!! But really amazing. \nI went with my husbands and co-workers, we ordered the pig tail, very fatty but really tasty, the Brussels are really good. And we got the burgers are really good, for me need more flavoring sauce, not the best burger but really good."]
['If I could give six stars, I would! Impeccable service, food was outstanding and one of the most memorable meals I have had! Perhaps it was because we were there for a special occasion so it was all the more meaningful to dine there. We had their tasting menu. The pasta and pork belly were my favorites. I wish I was staying longer in Boston to come back!  Highly recommend.']
["We have been meaning to eat here for years but something always got in the way. We finally made it and was treated to an excellent meal and great service. for apps we order the fried clams and grilled octopus. both were delicious. For entree' -- the wife order the ribeye and I ordered the burger with bacon and eggs. They were both fantastic. Their burgers are famous and I liked it very much, but I loved the ribeye and look forward to trying again. Finally the service was awesome. They were consistently attending to the table, but what really surprised us was they comp'd our drinks because it had arrived after the appetizers were delivered. We didn't ask and it was very unexpected. Speaking if drinks -- we ordered the special manhattan and hibiscus martini. Both were excellent"]
['My wife and I have been trying to get to this place for over two years, but one thing or another seemed to always thwart our plans.  We finally had dinner for the first time last night at Craigie On Main and it was worth the wait!  \n\nWe did the six course dinner where we were told each of the plates would be a "surprise" and they only tell you what you\'re getting as each plate is delivered.  (You can also order and put together your own combo of plates using the other side of the menu.)  I\'m not one for too many surprises when it comes to my meals, so without revealing any of the dishes, they were very accommodating.  After a few questions about foods I would like to avoid the most, while also making accommodations for my wife\'s meal due to her gluten allergy, they brought out plate after plate of deliciousness without any unwanted "surprises".  \n\nThey don\'t do wine pairings, per se, but again our waiter was exceptional and offered to bring us half glasses of a variety of wines that he personally paired with each dish, and there was not a poor choice among them.  \n\nAll-in-all, the food was fantastic and the service was exceptional.  I highly recommend checking out Craigie On Main if you haven\'t been before.  I know we\'ll be finding reasons to return ourselves!']
["GET THE BURGER. \n\nI almost want to leave my review as just that but it doesn't do justice to the best burger that I've had of my life. They only serve 16 a night, so get there early. The beef is local, grass fed and mixed with miso and bone marrow for the most melt in your mouth flavors. They cook the meat perfectly, and it's served with house made ketchup. It's worth noting that their cocktails are divine and unique- sitting at the bar at craigie is always one of my favorite experiences.\n\nBUT SERIOUSLY, I HAVE DREAMS ABOUT THIS BURGER."]
['LOOOOOVE! \n\nBeen wanting to try this place for a LONG time, now. When I say long, I mean a few years. Haha.\n\nWhy oh WHY did I wait so long? It was really a great experience. \n\nWhen I went with my bf, it was during Passover so they featured a Passover menu. Yum! My bf is Jewish and we really were looking forward to trying the chef\'s take on all the faves he had growing up. \n\nFirst of all, atmosphere is great. It has a casual feel to it, over all, which I really enjoyed. There is an open kitchen and we were initially offered seats at the "bar" to see the kitchen in action, but we decided to be a little more intimate for our first experience there. Next time, though!!  \n\nDrinks were good, mine was great. I don\'t remember what it was called but it was really yummy. \n\nThe food. Oh the food. \n\nYUM. \n\nWe couldn\'t decide so we decided to do the 6 course tasting. Everything was spectacular !!!!! \n\nThe food was done so well, I don\'t even know how to review it. \nEverything was cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly and I had a disco party in my mouth. \n\nMy faves were (everything).... \nGreen pea hummus, matzo pasta with braised veal (!!!!!) and the salted chocolate mousse dessert. \n\nI am already dreaming of my next visit.....\n\nI want to live there!!!!']
["Ate here with my sister and her mister. We didn't have any reservations but were able to snag seats at the bar on a saturday at 5:30PM. The ambiance is suave and sexy. It is a great place for a date. Mellow yellow cocktail was good. It was fun to watch the bartender at work, but next time I would get a table near the kitchen so I could see the chefs do their magic. Complimentary bread was yummy as well as the amuse bouche. We shared the octopus appetizier, the pig's head, and a burger between the 3 of us. Overall, the food was executed really well. My favorite was the octopus grilled to perfection. The pig's head was saved peking style with pancakes, hoisin sauce, and sprouts and pumpkin sambal. I honestly didn't love the dish, but I admit I do not frequently eat pig's head so I have nothing to compare it to. I thought it was rather fatty and had little meat. Favorite part was the ear. I didn't like the hoisin sauce and their wasn't enough of the veggie accompaniment. The burger was nicely prepared, but to be frank I liked the side of fries more than the burger. \n\nService was phenomenal and the experience of dining hear can't be beat. Complimetnary housemade peppermints were a great way to the end the meal."]
['We had a perfect dining experience yesterday at "Craigie on Main" - warm welcome, impeccable service, well-crafted drinks, and amazing food.\n\nMy girlfriend and I had the full chef\'s whim tasting menu and were not disappointed a bit. It\'s nice to be able to sit down and not have to go over options - stressing out whether or not you picked the right thing. The food was amazing: after a small bite (smoked trout crostini) the chef sent us a refreshing sunchokes and shrimps frisée salad, a perfectly cooked cod a la plancha, fried clams, foie gras stuffed quail, and - after a small intermezzo - coconut-yuzu vacherin and spiced chocolate tart as desserts.\n\nThe only plate we were not big fans of was the crispy fried clams dish: nothing wrong with it, clams were crispy and the dried olives were a nice touch, but (for us at least) was a bit on a heavy-side given the rest of the menu. \n\nCannot wait to go back!']
['My husband and I had heard nothing but wonderful things about Craigie on Main, sadly our night out absolutely did not live up to our expectations. \n\nI planned my husband\'s birthday party at Craigie on Main, followed by a surprise party. I informed the hostess upon making the reservation and the day of our dinner that we had a surprise party we were headed to after dinner and needed to be out of the restaurant at a specific time. She assured me it would not be a problem and suggested we arrive early for our reservation at 9pm. \n\nOur party arrived at 8:45pm and we were told it would be a short wait. Five, ten, twenty minutes later we still weren\'t seated. When I brought up the issue to the manager 45 minutes later she responded to my frustration with "this is why we don\'t take reservations before 9pm!"...which was completely beside the point as it was 9:30. We finally get seated and the service was great to start out with the waitress getting our wine and orders in quickly..then our food took forever. After we were finished eating we sat with empty plates on the table for at least 15 minutes with no staff in site. We ended up leaving with our custom cake boxed up since we were already very late for our own party. \n\nWhen you visit a restaurant like this you expect a certain level of service. Let\'s be honest, it\'s not the cheapest place in town. This place really needs to look at how they treat their customers and if they can\'t accommodate a party of 8, don\'t take the reservation in the first place.']
['One of the best "French" restaurants you\'ll find in the States. The service is impeccable and the food is fantastic. But, if you\'re lucky, and you get there before 6pm, and you sit at the bar, you just might get the best burger of your life. If they haven\'t already sold out. Happy eating.']
['I was in town from NYC for the weekend. Friday night was Tiger Mama, which was superb, Saturday night was Craigie on Main.\n\nCOM had received as much hype as I\'d ever heard for a Boston restaurant, that said I try to take a formalist approach to culinary criticism. The idea is to experience the food as a complete standalone from the hype, expectations, chef, pricing strategy and even the atmosphere. I later take all that into consideration but at first I want to understand the food, the concept of each dish, the flavor profile, and the way it makes me feel. \n\nFirst plates were Pigs Tail, Chicken Leg Confit, Phytoplankton Radiatori and Octopus La Plancha. With the exception of the Chicken Leg, which was one of the poorest showings of the night, with more of porridge-like consistency than anything that would resemble confit, everything else was quite good. (Side note: the server described the Duck Leg as a big bowl of deliciousness, yet it was anything but that). The Phytoplankton was a particular standout. The incorporation of Asian influences into pseudo-Italian pasta dishes is a popular concept right now. Where restaurants like Basta Pasta in NYC fall short, Craigie nailed this one. The Pig\'s tail was also excellent, tasting like a more petite spare rib with greater complexity of flavor contributed by the pickled peanuts and sweet and sour sauce. Expectations after first plates were reasonably high. \n\nThen second plates were Prime Rib, Cavatelli, Scallops and Hake. \nThe scallops were serviceable and lacked the textured crust you\'d expect on the top and bottom from a dry scallop and searing hot pan. The sauce on the scallops was simplistic and unmemorable. The Prime Rib was incredibly rubbery and because the medium rare temperature looked to have been achieved by the color of the meat, I\'d question the quality of this particular cut. The Cavatelli was perhaps the worst item on the menu, devoid of flavor and any kind of meaningful presentation. The hake was served with clams, both were overdone. \n\nNet net, the food alone was not at all impressive. There were certain dishes from the first plates like the Pig\'s Tail and Phytoplankton that did deliver but 2 dishes out of 8 does not make for a favorable experience. On the food alone I rate this restaurant 2 stars. \n\nNow factoring in the service, which surprisingly was a let down as you would think Saturday night means the "A" team, I rate this restaurant 1.5 stars. The staff really just appeared to be going through the motions. They were cordial and somewhat prompt, but their overall lack of knowledge and attention to detail was lacking. When I asked for clarification on two of the dishes I received mirror explanations to those I\'d just read in the menu. When I ask for deeper insight I\'d expect to hear more on the WHAT as it relates to flavor components, and for a really good waitstaff, I\'d also expect to hear WHY a chef chooses to include a particular dish. Lastly on price, and I really don\'t think any price is too expensive for a superb experience, COM is pricing on reputation and hype. The service, food and overall experience fall way short. I\'d be open to going back and trying the bar for the burger, but the main dining is inferior to any number of restaurants elsewhere in Boston.']
['WOW!  \n\nHad my first 10 course tasting experience here and it was amazing!  We also had to order an extra side of bone marrow which was cooked perfectly!  Well worth it!']
["I want to preference that this review is strictly based on the burger.  Overall very good burger. Cooked perfectly. My 1 complaint would be you don't get a ton of the juicy beef flavor when you bite into it but rather the bone marrow salt flavor."]
["There are very few restaurants that I can honestly say have impressed me beyond all expectations, but this is one of them. The beautiful Decor, the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff, and the amazing selection of liquor and mixed drinks serve only to compliment the unmatched Splendor of the food. I don't use adjectives like these lightly, and I will say that every experience I have had dining at this restaurant has been nothing short of phenomenal. Chef Tony Maws is a mad genius, and I have enjoyed his creations and experimental dishes at the tastings. Combine that with a collection of rare, eclectic types of scotch, wine, and other alcohols, and you have a recipe for success. Like Rolex, every aspect of production is done in-house, from butchering to plating, allowing for total control over the quality of the final product. I would invite anyone to come and see for yourself if I'm exaggerating!"]
['What can I say, for me Craigie is all about the amazing cocktails. Seriously. Get there early, grab a seat at the bar, order one of their burgers (only like 20 a day), have a fab drink or two and enjoy the best half of the house ;)']
['Bind blowing!!! One of my favorite restaurants.  We have been a couple if times. Most recently, we went for their "game dinner". It amazed me how the chef thinks of some of these dishes. Every course was a different food orgasm! \nThere is an open kitchen, and I love watching the chef and cooks in action. You know when they plate the food with tweezers it\'s gonna be good. The service is impeccable as well. \nAs far as the bad reviews go...yes, sometimes you have to wait even with a reservation, but the cocktails are fantastic. Just plan on waiting around enjoying a couple. Anyone who was "underwhelmed" by the food probably just doesn\'t know enough about food to appreciate it. \nCraigie is expensive, but well worth every penny. Can\'t wait to go back.']
["As a foodie in Boston, I've been long awaiting the chance to eat here. Went in a group with my four other roommates for Sunday brunch,--one of the last few brunches offered before they take the menu down at the end of the year.\n\nWe all ordered pretty different things: the roasted local summer vegetables, the seasonal pasta, a few house-made donuts, and of course the famed grass-fed beef burger. Everyone was happy with what they ordered, but the stars of the table were *definitely* the burger and donuts. \n\nListen to everyone here on yelp, and--despite Tony Maws saying his burger is somewhat overhyped--ORDER THE BURGER AND DONUTS.\n\nCan't wait until I get a chance at their dinner tasting menu, but until then...I'll still be dreaming of their doughnut and burger."]
['Be sure to make your reservation early here because it gets packed! In order to have the famous secret burger you must be seated on the bar side of the restaurant. There are only 18 burgers available so if you definitely want one, I suggest getting there on the earlier side. I went on a sunday at 6pm and there were only 2 burgers left. Needless to say the burger was delicious! I actually broke being a vegetarian for it. I also got the squid ink pasta and loved it. The staff was great and I will definitely be going back again!']
["I have to admit I was not super impressed with Craigie on Main. After hearing many great things, I had high expectations, but I was let down consistently across the board. To start, my server was not very helpful. When I asked her to recommend a bottle of wine for dinner she recommended the most expensive one on the menu (really?) even after I pointed to the one I was considering (to give her an idea of price range). I really did not enjoy my first course--head cheese--and my main course (filet) was underwhelming, albeit cooked very well. My dessert was nothing special, but my husband's was quite good. Perhaps I just ordered poorly (maybe I should have gotten the burger!) but I will not be returning to this restaurant. The price to food quality ratio was truly disappointing."]
["From beginning to the end and all in between Craigie on Main is Utopia.\n knowledgable service with a smile to ambrosial menu, comfy atmosphere!\nI'll be back for shizza!"]
["Craigie is superb!  I went with a couple of my girlfriends and enjoyed every dish that we were served.  I opted for the pork done 3 ways and I finished everything on the plate.  I think the highlight of the night was the bone marrow.  I've had some bone marrow that smelled a little funky/off but the one at Craigie was very clean and unctuous and just phenomenal!!  \n\nFor dessert we had panna cotta that had this gelatinous layer to it and it was some of the best panna cotta I've ever eaten.  I can see why their ratings are so high!!  Would love to come for breakfast some time."]
['Quality has been steadily going down. Still good, but no longer worth the price.']
['Really enjoyed this restaurant. We visited today while in Cambridge and were not disappointed. The food was excellent. We also really enjoyed their homemade rolls. Had to stop ourselves from eating several more baskets. \n\nFor me, I categorize restaurants as 4-star if they serve excellent food that I would readily recommend. This restaurant meets that standard. To get to a 5-star, I always want that "memorable" flavor of taste that sticks with me for a long time. I usually have a meal like that two or three times a year. I\'d say that for me this wasn\'t at that level. We ordered the beef brisket, which was very good but certainly not something that was memorable versus others I\'ve had. I think it\'s safe to say that everything was very good, but not amazing. It also did not help that we sat in a high-top table right next to the fire extinguisher, which was just a bit uncomfortable. But the place is popular and that was the only table we could get. So it was no big deal, really. \n\nSpecial shout out to Sandy for taking good care of us with drinks and water. She has a great personality and honestly we didn\'t want anyone else to come to our table but her! Just having her there boosts the restaurant to a 4-star in my book.']
['Epic eating experience. Only in Boston for one day so every eat had to be on point / and this one thankfully was well worth it!\n\nGot a reservation by fortuitous timing. Nice ambiance even in the bar area. Bread was great - always a good sign. Loved everything we had. Highlight was Vermont Ham. Squid ink rigatoni was an especially nice touch to start with.']
['Great food, experience.   Welcoming ambiance.  A fun, bustling place.  Open kitchen, great to watch the action from a counter seat.  Jesse the waiter was very helpful and informative.   Lovely amuse bouches before meal &amp; sweet surprise tastes at the end.   Each dish was unique with fresh ingredients.  I had the matzo pasta with boudin noir and a vegetarian entree with baby carrots &amp; camargue red rice. Dessert was roasted blueberry parfait with an interesting herb gelato.']
['Excellent dining experience all around, from the table service to the food itself.  Waiters were very friendly and attentive, as well as well versed on the menu items.  I enjoyed the 8 course tasting menu for the "full Craigie on Main experience", and got just that.  The dishes truly exemplified the hyper locality and nose-to-tail philosophy of the restaurant, without feeling too forced.  Some dishes may have been a bit much for more timid eaters, but perfect for a more adventurous diner like myself.  Overall an excellent meal; I would highly recommend Craigie on Main to anyone looking for an elegantly "out of the box" dining experience.']
["I've been meaning to try this place for a little over a year now and I'm happy to report it was worth the wait! Excellent menu, impeccable wines, knowledgable waitstaff combined with a cozy, elegant ambiance. The bone marrow was the best I've had in Boston. Fried clams, halibut and sirloin were all top notch!"]
["I've been here a couple of times. My dad loves the place. I do not. The first time I found the food excessively rich and not particularly imaginative. Given the price it probably would have been between three and four stars. This particular review is for their New Year's dinner. Yes, it's a little late. I had other things to do. \nSo here's the deal. New Years is pure bank for restaurants. They know exactly how many plates they will sell, they charge a premium, and people are generally in a good mood. It's a night to bring in the money: amateur night as we used to call it. \nBut here's the problem. If you are going to charge  $160 a person you should be able to come up with a more original menu and enough food that your customers don't leave hungry. This ain't exactly cuisine minceur. So what the hell's the deal. So here's a small (pun intended) example: Sashimi of Hiramasa had, I kid you not, less than 1oz of fish (my guess would be 1/2); the prosciutto and chicory salad took advantage of it's being a salad to almost not be there; the scallop dish had...one scallop (not joking); the veal cheek rye gnocci were laughably devoid of veal cheeks (did you guys underestimate how many people were going to order it?). I literally could not find (or taste) any veal cheeks in the dish--and that pissed me off because I LOVE veal cheaks; the beef dish was no more than 2oz and completely uninspired in terms of flavors (I would have taken the halibut but that sounded uninspired as well and I wanted to taste the boudin blanc); the yuzu vacherin was the size of my rather small thumb and completely tasteless. \nSo the food was completely utterly uninspired. OK, most people aren't going to be bothered by that. As I said, it's New Years. Nobody cares. \nWhat I do care about, and what smacks of a deliberate attempt to abuse the consumer, is the fact that a $160 meal (that, for four people with tip was $1200--the most I have ever paid on one restaurant check!) left me not only vaguely hungry, literally clamoring for something to eat. I got home and made myself a large sandwich. The meal I just had at Zahav in Philly cost exactly 1/4 of what I spent at Craigie's and it was 100x more fun, interesting, flavorful, etc. \nThe only thing I am grateful for is that I didn't take the wine pairing: for an extra $70 a person they were pairing wine and beer (yes) with each dish. The pours I saw were less than 2oz. So somewhere around 12oz of wine/beer for $70. So that would have been close to $300 for our table. I would expect at least two bottles + of wine for the table at that price. \n\nSo here's the reality. You are leaving people like me (and my dad, a regular customer) with a bitter taste in their mouth for a few extra dollars. Food and wine costs were not your primary expense. For a couple of thousand dollars, you would have left your customers satisfied and still have gotten that usual New Year's benefit. Those few dollars with have come back to you down the road in good feelings. Instead, you chose to rip your customers off and you lost me for ever, and I have serious doubts my dad will be back either--and that's some serious money right there. \nLike I said, I have not found the food at Craigie's particularly interesting or good...just excessively rich. But to actually go out of your way to take advantage of people is no joke and they should be ashamed of yourselves for that."]
['We had high expectations about eating here. We are from LA and had one night in Boston. We first head about the chef owner Tony Maws after reading the book titled "Back of the House" and it was on our list of places to explore so we were thrilled when we had the chance to do so. \n\nNo complaints at all about the food. The service started well with a very nice amuse bouche and the appetizers and entrees, and dessert were all stellar. Enough rave reviews have been written so I won\'t dwell on the fact that the kitchen staff do a great job of turning out quality product.\n\nThe service however was lacking. The busboy was on top of his job but after the appetizer our waiter pretty much vanished for the evening and we waited an inordinate amount of time to receive our main course. That is not the waiters fault but it was compounded by long delays in being able to make a dessert choice, receive it and finally pay the bill so we could escape into the cool, clear night air of Boston. My title says it all.']
["After our last underwhelming experience at craigie on main, we recently returned only to have our hair blown back eating some of the best tasting food I've ever eaten. We ordered the 6 course tasting menu and I customized mine to exclude cows, pigs, and organ meat. They completely indulged my picky food choices and were happy to make substitutions. Highlights of the meal included the John Dory and the radiatori pasta with razor clams, chili, uni butter (still dreaming about this dish). Everything else was fabulous including our sweet server, the wine, service, etc. Thank you craigie on main for a lovely, magical experience!"]
["Pretty average for the price. Better service, food, and ambience can definitely be found elsewhere. Like a few other reviews have mentioned, limited menu choices. Only three-, six-, eight-course meals are available, but each course can also be ordered ala carte, which was what we did. Extremely small portions when you order a single course, so I guess it's best to go with the multiple course meal, which starts at around $70 for the 3-course menu.\n\nUpdate:\n\nI was contacted by the management after the review was written; they apologized for the less than stellar experience I had and offered to make it up to me. Regardless of food and their pricing, the fact that Craigie took reviews seriously enough and reached out to me deserves a thumbs up!"]
['food was alright.. nothing special and WAYYYYY OVER PRICED.']
["Finally got to try the burger I've been drooling over....and it was everything I imagined and more. How is it possible to have a burger melt in your mouth?!?! The egg was cooked perfectly and oozed everywhere, so perfect!\nBirthday donut appetizer  was soo good. I was waiting to share with my friend and the smell was killing me, I could barely wait until she got back to the table. I loved the thick, crusty outer part and the soft cakey inside with that yummy light dolce de leche/caramel sauce.  Counting the days until my next visit...."]
['Terrific dining experience.  I went with 3 friends based on a bet.  We even had car service so that we could drink and then drink some more.\n\nWe did the 8 course tasting menu.  It was great fun.  Each dish was inventive and unusual.  I enjoyed the varied tastes and textures from dish to dish.  Highly recommended for any foodie.']
["This review is for a cocktail and dessert only. Popped in after a late dinner and sat at the bar. I had a rhubarb tequila cocktail. I don't remember what all was in it expect the awesomeness. Seriously good. The dessert was insane! It was a strawberry consume with tarragon ice cream, tapioca, a giant pavlova. It was creative, beautiful and above all tasty I would love to eat a meal here. I can see why it's a hot ticket."]
['FIVE STARS for Chef Tony Maws\' Craigie on Main Restaurant. It doesn\'t get better than this!\n\nMove over Chef Nobu Matsuhisa.\nMove over Chef Masaharu Morimoto.\nMove over Chef Tom Colicchio.\nMove over Chef Rick Bayless.\nMove over Chef Susan Feniger.\n\nI\'ve eaten at all of your (above) restaurants in the last year, and Chef Tony Maws\' gets my personal James Beard Award for his cooking. He\'s the man to beat! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#UMGlBCHzNLsKHe_PBc9wog\n\nI was fortunate to come here for dinner tonight and experience Chef Maws excellent cooking. We first started off at the bar and were entertained by Bartender / Mixologist Ted\'s unique drinks. I asked him to make me one of his famous drinks, and I got the "Citizen". It was a mix of home-made orange liquor, bitters, Thai Chili pepper water, and sparkling wine. HOME RUN! Drink Grade: A! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#HVmHDKHilX6pQ-BdTB50Nw\n\nWe were served two different types of amuse bouche (since my dinner companion is a vegetarian):\n\nAmuse Bouche #1: Pork Head Cheese with an espresso mustard sauce, garnised by fresh greens. LOVE how they included dark green fern leafs as part of the creation! Delightful! Grade: A-\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ALKvdQbWAkY1cPcRWvDlEA.\n\nAmuse Bouche #2: Home made goat cheese on Radicchio. Looked very fresh and the flavors of the goat cheese was very rich and deep! Grade: A-\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ZV_FdWwVYk5JkM5aYhgORA\n\nAppetizer #1: Grilled Spanish Octopus. Grilled cipollini onions, green olive, and lemon salad, bulgur wheat, spiced artichoke puree. Octopus was very tender and the accompanying sauce balanced out the seafood. Nice. Grade: B+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#L9BjFPhIbU9TJld9gdj0hg\n\nAppetizer #2: Asparagus soup. My colleague had this soup and he said it was very mild and well balanced. Tasted like it had a bit of potato in the soup stock. Delish! Grade: A-\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#IT5nxJTqO5XRNJxfcE7agQ\n\nMain Meal #1: Confit and Roasted milk-fed Pig\'s Head. This dish was supposed to be for two people to share, but I ate the entire thing by myself. Crispy skin outside and fatty juicy pork on the inside. Served with a Kabocha samal (slaw), boudin noir-hoisin sauce, fresh home-made Peiking style pancake, and French Grey Salt. I wanted to crey with delight at the table. The entire restaurant looked at my dish in envy. Note: Order this early because there are only limited quantities of this! Grade: A+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#thgSr-UyuQqnc9l8V8Ecpw\n\nMain Meal #2: Dayboat Black Bass a la Plancha: Iraqui beet stew, pine nuts, and horseradish. This dish was visually beautiful. The bass was cooked to perfection - seared on the outside with a tender flesh inside. Bravo on this dish!\n\nAmuse Bouche / Palate Cleanser: Before they served our dessert, they brought to the table a small amuse bouche of white asparagus ice cream surrounded by a rhubarb puree. The chef put pieces of cooked rhubarb chunks in the puree, which gave it a nice texture. Ingenious dessert. Visually sexy! Grade: A+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#2B8r-JBQ1f1-zAN2847PhQ\n\nDessert: We ordered the trio of artisanal cheeses - sheep, goat, and cow milk cheese - each chosen daily. The sheep cheese was served with Spanish fruit jelly, the goat cheese was served with diced medjool dates, and the cow\'s milk was served with bee honeycomb. OUTSTANDING cheese selection and combination. Served with fresh French baguette. Grade: A+http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#ohJ9G-G7QI9qC4yxXT_JJA\n\nDrinks: Craigie has about 75-100 bottles in their wine selection! Wine is imported in from all around the world and the price ranges are reasonable to very reasonable. We ordered the 2008 Bourgogne Domaine JF Coche-Dury ($130/bottle). You won\'t be disappointed! The wine was delicious with notes of fruit, oak, and cheese. Grade: A+.\n\nAmuse bouche finale:  French macaron of Chai Tea!   Yum! Grade: B+ http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#CPgfuiwAJSd5LVVqvNqtJw\n\nFor dessert wines, order the Tawny port (sorry, can\'t remember the name). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/58cDJU4cub1o0o0B4h9GrA?userid=jI5grCzPrcpYgqtNVygWRQ#aOURd_WIEPx2mstsYrjA1A\n\nService by waitress Emily was absolutely outstanding. She provided excellent service and knew both her food and drinks. Service was also excellent from backup server, Greg.\n\nChef Tony Maws - BRAVO on such a wonderful restaurant. I like the vision that you have for the food, and all of your dishes are well executed!']
['After all the build up, our party was disappointed. The server was crabby. Squid ink pasta was good but stuffed chicken was unremarkable. Portions were small. The meal was not worth the $$$$ price. To top it off, they clustered diners together at adjacent tables despite the spaciousness of the restaurant. Perhaps this was done for the convenience of the servers (?) but we felt like we were dining with the folks seated at an adjacent table. Ridiculous.']
["Really great place for dinner and drinks. It's pricey, but it's worth it - you taste things in a different way, I like that. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive. I went there for the first time yesterday, and we spend 2.5 hrs at dinner, it was awesome. I wish I had the burger (as you can see from all the reviews it's supposed to be great), but it sold out by the time we arrived. Oysters are amazing and their drinks are dangerously good. I think I had the cranberry tart drink x3. Good place for a date night!"]
["I'm giving 3 stars for the Chef's Whim 6 course tasting menu. The service and the atmosphere were actually pretty on point. I just thought that the tasting menu was off. I just felt if you have a tasting menu that you make up on the fly, then the big picture of the meal will be missed. \n\nMe and the wife had the meat, and vegetarian tasting menus. I knew there was something not right when we both got the same first course, but one had meat, and the other did not. That set the tone for the rest of the menu.  The dishes were fine, I just felt that if you are going to have 2.5 hr 6 course tasting menu, each dish should be spot on.\n\nI would love to go another time, and try their regular menu."]
["This place was terrible. My BF and I came here for brunch.    The waiter we had looked down his nose at us.  And I'm not sure about you, but I really enjoy regular sausage with my eggs.  This place only offered rabbit sausage."]
["Are you looking for a sophisticated and tasty light dinner in a nice, but casual environment? Are you willing to spend at least $50 for it? Well if you said yes, this place has your answer. \n\nIt is highly recommended that you make a reservation since this place is not a really big restaurant. Even changing the reservation from two people to three was a little difficult because we would have to go at a later time, which indicates how popular this place is. \n\nWe arrived at our table, and we were told that we will have the Chef's Whim menu. This menu is a surprise, and it is whatever the chef will make. They provide a note card and a pencil to write down what the servers explain to you and in case you want to remember what you ordered here. We ordered a four course version, which consisted of the following:\n\nBluefish with a rice cracker served in a small dish.\nKampachi sashimi with a Harissa rose vinaigrette, red onion shiso salsa and avocado puree. \nTautog Cape Cod Fish with red Quinoa Puree, Peeky Toe Crab and Jerusalem Artichokes. \nSirloin with Bok Choy, oxtail pastrami, and a creamy potato puree.\n\nThe first two dishes were extremely small, but presentation was impressive. I ate the bluefish in one bite. The texture of the fish combined with the crunch of the cracker made this a great snack. The sashimi was tasty and the avocado gave it a nice flavor. The Tautog was fantastic. Every bite had a great texture combined with a nice rich flavor. It was very freshly cooked and I really liked the Quinoa Puree. If I had two of those Tautog dishes combined with a generous large scoop of rice, it would have been a hearty, but very delicious and excellent meal I would not mind eating often for dinner. The Sirloin was also fantastic, and shows that steak and bok choy can make a great and tasty combination. The beef was juicy, tender, flavorful, but most importantly, really tasty. The texture of the bok choy was just right, and the potato puree was a great complement to the sirloin. \n\nWe got a variety of desserts, which included flan, a couple thin strips of chocolate, and an ice cream dish mixed with brownies and peanuts. The ice cream was all right, it was a little melted, but the brownies and the nuts were good. The flan though was probably the best dessert. The desserts were able to make our stomachs significantly fuller than before.  \n\nThe four course Chef's Whim menu, combined with a couple rolls of bread, a dessert dish, and a glass of fresh drinkable water, should be enough to feed one person as a light but almost moderate dinner, especially if one had a really heavy lunch several hours before coming here. \n\nService was actually really good. The server was really nice, patient, professional, and very knowledgeable about the dishes. One of the bartenders happens to be a classmate who went to my high school, so it was cool to see her again after eight years. I was surprised she even recognized me and we talked a little bit. Interior looks casual so I guess my recommendation is that you can wear jeans, but wear a nice buttoned shirt with a collar. It also gives a slight feeling that you are almost in a large living room rather than a restaurant. \n\nOverall, this place probably has one of the tastiest light dinners I had in Cambridge so far. This place is a worthwhile visit if you have a good amount of money to spend for a light dinner with an impressive presentation and good service. This place may have a legitimate chance to be the best restaurant in Cambridge and one representation of some of the finest restaurants in the somewhat decent State of Massachusetts."]
["This is the best meal that I have EVER had. \n\nI took my boyfriend here for his 30th birthday. We opted to do the 3 course meal although I believe they also have a 6 course, and then they have a chefs tasting menu.\n\nAs a nurse, I can't afford myself fine dining on a regular basis, in fact, I have never seen the point....but we knew we wanted to try this place and had heard good things. I can say that I have never had better service in my life. They were attentive but not intrusive. We were able to have a nice intimate dinner. \n\nWe started with a salad and crispy pigs tails. I am so glad I braved the concept, because they were SO GOOD. For dinner my boyfriend had the steak, and I had the diver scallops. Portions were small, but I definitely realized that this is the first time that I have ever had Scallops cooked correctly. They were delicious. I can't remember what we had for dessert, because I was so preoccupied with the fact that I had 45 people waiting at our house to surprise my boyfriend. \n\nI can tell you though, that we are going back to sit at the bar for my birthday. We can't wait to try the burger and have some more pig tails. This is definitely a special restaurant, and I suggest it to anyone who is celebrating or wants a night out.\n\nOh also great beer selection and excellent mixology with cocktail!"]
['Hands down to the most delicate and refined dishes in town! We went there for Sunday Brunch and were amazed by how delicious and well managed this place is. Their donut is to die for!\nI had the Grass-Fed Beef Cheek, Brisket, and Smoked Beef Tongue Hash, a lot of flavors and textures going on, and yet, very delicious. My husband had the Local Grass-Fed Burger accompanied by crispy fries, and that was also very yummy. The dishes are wonderfully plated, and the portion is perfectly sized. We will definitely be going back there for dinner.\n\nI suggest you make your reservation online or over the phone prior to going there. \n\n...and when they offer you the donut, SAY YES!!!']
['I probably won\'t be saying anything particularly new about Craigie on Main, but here goes...\n\nPhenomenal food all around. I was just there this past Sunday evening to try out the Chef\'s Whim for the first time, and I was far from disappointed. The four-course tasting menu was executed perfectly, with some of the most memorable flavors I\'ve tasted in a long time. It was also a strong showing, with no particular "weak dishes" that tend to crop up in a tasting menu. I will note that it seems like Craigie on Main is less experimental with their tasting menu than T.W. (Improv Night) or Asta. In my opinion, the focus is more towards the traditional, and in a sense, mastering the traditional. The menu had a strong leaning toward meats (no complaints here), and that comes across as a unique point.\n\nI remember most two particular dishes. One featured wild-caught Scottish salmon with rock shrimp and mussels. I still have no idea how they prepared the salmon, but in the end it was just so soft and buttery, tasting as if I were eating the highest-grade sashimi! Very surprising. The other dish featured sirloin and veal sweetbread. The veal sweetbread had to be my favorite part -- surprisingly tender, rich, full of flavor, and yes, slightly sweet.\n\nAll in all, an amazing dinner at a great value! I highly recommend it.\n\n*With my bf, we each received the same dishes up until dessert. This is a bit different than at Improv Night (all different courses) and at Asta (few dishes in common, most were not, ordering a 5 + 8 combo).\n\n*I\'ve been here previously and had the half pig\'s head for two. Definitely try this if you\'re a fan of traditional Chinese BBQ style pork, crispy skin, and deliciously tender meat with plenty of fat to go along with it. Also be warned that it is not for the squeamish once you get past the first layer of skin/fat/meat.']
["Just because we were not advised prior to ordering that the pig's head was going to be a supplement to the usual menu and ended up with a much heftier bill - otherwise a great restaurant - but the wait staff should be better trained. Perfect Spanish octopus."]
["Went here for the prix fixe Valentine's Day meal. \n\nThe food is 5 stars.\nThe service was 3 given the price point. \n\nIf you are going to charge over $200 PER PERSON, you need to do things like wipe the crumbs off the table. They did fold napkins when I got up and refill drinks, but I didn't see the server as much as I would have liked. She was very pleasant but I could barely hear her she was so soft-spoken. \n\nWhat really stood out to me was they brought the wrong wine pairing for one of the dishes. He offered to just leave it at the table and let us drink it. THEN THEY DIDN'T BRING THAT WINE PAIRING WHEN THE DISH IT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO WITH CAME. Seriously? You could see I didn't have a pairing when that later dish was out.\n\nIt was very good, but for the price I expected a lot more."]
["Nice ambience, superb service, but the food was so-so. The presentation was lovely, portions were sufficient, but the taste just wasn't that great at all. I probably will not come back."]
["I love surprises! Especially when it is the Chef's Whim ($40) at Craigie On Main. \n\nI don't even know I would be getting the Chef's Whim because originally my reservations was at 7:30 pm and thinking of what to order has been on my mind after reading all these reviews on yelp: Fried Pig Tails? Octopus? Burger? Pig Head? But after switching my reservations to 9:30 pm... my only choice is the Chef's surprise.\n\nCan I just say I enjoyed everything?\n\nBluefish \nKampachi sashimi \nTautog Cape Cod Fish - nicely panfried with a nice crispy skin\nSirloin with Bok Choy - so tender with a oxtail based sauce prepared medium rare\n\nAll were nicely presented and prepared with great care. From the light in texture/flavour/complexity to the heavy. Each dish has it own character. Small portions were great for me so I can savour every bite!!\n\nDessert Time! Another surprise!! We were presented with 3 different desserts! All so pretty and delicious too!!\n\nFlan with a ribbon like cake on top\nWarm Dark Chocolate Brownies with Ice Cream and caramel sauce\nTorte - layered with cake, chocolate and butter cream\n\nThe Craigie On Main Chef's Whim Menu is definitely worth every penny. Just come with a open mind and willing to try everything and you would not be disappointed!!\n\nServices are attentive and professional!! The wait staffs served all our dish exactly the same time... and explain everything items in the dish for us. The blank menu is perfect for us to take some notes!\n\nOh Kampachi is from Hawaii? Can you spell Kampachi for me.... I am taking notes! ;)"]
["A couple years after my first visit, I finally made it around to trying the infamous Craigie burger!  The patty is 100% grass fed beef and the texture is outstanding from the incorporation of several cuts of beef.  The flavor profile is spot on and, in fact, elevated very nicely by the miso powder with support from the delicately soft house-made bun.  I've gotta add that the accompanying steak fries were unusually tasty and stayed crispy even long after cooling down.\n\nSo, how'd I come to the 4 stars?  CoM absolutely deserves a visit for the burger, but could be skipped for everything else really.  The food overall is good, but overpriced as I've had better at enough other places for less money.  So if you want to try dinner here, go for the Chef's Whim if anything.  Service is generally top notch, yet I had the misfortune of having an older and rather awkward gentleman serve us the other day.  And to totally echo Cassy H.'s sentiments, the restaurant itself is awfully cramped and noisy for a fine dining establishment.  Anything that interferes with meal conversation is a huge pet peeve of mine and sadly, CoM hits the nail right on the head."]
["Some friends and I were looking for dinner and happened to stumble upon this place. And I'm so, so glad we did. They happened to seat us right away on a Saturday night since a reservation failed to show up. Score!\n\nThe cocktails here was amazing! And the food was solid. I had the oysters with lemon foam for my appetizer and the pork three ways for my entree. Everything was so good, including dessert. \n\nLoved this place!"]
["I have been here a handful of times and I'm always reminded how great this place is.\n\nI have come most frequently for the Chef's Whim, a Sunday night 4 or 6 course adventure for a great price. The dishes are small, but I'm always surprised at how satiated afterwards. It is always fun and exciting food and they accommodate for food allergies/aversions. One of my favorite parts is the dessert - everyone at the table gets something different and it's so fun to share!\n\nWe also came once at opening time for the elusive burger. We were seated at 5:35, ordered our burger at 5:40 and they were sold out of it by 5:46 (I know b/c I looked at my watch). The meal started, as always, with an amuse-bouche: this evening it was either beef tongue or whitefish crudo. Both beautifully presents and delicious. Then the burger arrived. The best way I can describe it is as a steak burger rather than a ground-meat burger. It was perfectly cooked, and we opted to add bacon to it, which was a perfect addition! \n\nThe cocktail list is lovely, as is their beer list. The service was fantastic! The waiter was even super nice to the terrible, complaining table next to ours!\n\nWhile this place is a bit pricey, it is worth every penny!! Definitely check out the Chef's Whim!!!"]
['So, I was on the fence between 3 or 4 stars and would have given a 3.5 if I could. This place serves awesome food, and the service is knowledgeable and very friendly. We had been wanting to try this place out for some time now (like, years) and just never had. We spontaneously joined some friends one night for a birthday celebration and it was an awesome time, great vibes, great food - really fun night.\n\nWe all went with the "Ultimate Experience" 8 course tasting. Each course was small but delectable and by the end we were more than satisfied (full)...\n\nBut then the bill came. I suppose it wasn\'t anything unexpected but there\'s a difference between knowing sorta kinda what the bill is going to be, and actually seeing it on a receipt and agreeing to put your credit card down for it. There were four of us and the bill was over $800 including tip. Now, granted, we each had 3 cocktails and we split a bottle of wine (note, the cheapest on the menu ~$37). We certainly spared no expense and didn\'t worry much about what we were ordering because we had accepted, before even entering the restaurant, that it was going to be an expensive night.\n\nWith everything considered we really felt the meal was not worth $400+ for my wife and I. Again, I\'ll say, we very much enjoyed ourselves and our friends and the food was really good. But for $400+? I think this is a one-and-done. If you\'re willing to fork over that type of cash on one meal experience, go for it! We just feel that it\'s a little rich for our blood. We can gladly cross this one off the list and say we went, had a good time, and won\'t be back.']
['Great selection of quality ingredient, open nice kitchen that you can see as chefs work, friendly  and detail-oriented personnel, and of course pricy!']
['Awesome cocktails at the bar! Lots of options, too. Haven\'t tried the food but the restaurant has a friendly "nice" casual ambience.']
["An institution at Boston yet I have never been until recently. Shame on me!\n\nWent there with couple friends for dinner. It was snowing and stormy out, yet the restaurant surprisingly filled up. I took it as a very good sign. \n\nFor starter i had the House-Made Pâté de Trois Foies. To be frank I think Russel House serves a better dish - this one is just overly salty and bland. I did like all of the accompaniments though. We also shared the Crispy-Fried Pig's Tails. So much collagen! Good for the skin ladies =)\n\nFor mains we shared the Confit and Roasted Milk-Fed Pig's Head and the Vermont Pork Three Ways. The Pig's Head is not for the faint of the heart - it was a very realistic presentation of what you are eating. But I'm Chinese! Nothing can deter me. Although I liked it enough, at the end of the day it tasted more like the crispy roasted pork you can get in any good Cantonese BBQ place. Great for novelty factor, so so for value. The Vermont Pork on the other hand I highly recommend! I loved the three distinct presentations and ways of cooking it. It was rich without been fatty. \n\nAt the end of the meal I realized I just had a head-to-tail meal! I guess that amounts to something..."]
['What a disappointment.\n\nWe are not Bostonians but travel there from or home in Toronto with a certain degree of frequency and have been wanting to eat at Cragie for some time.  Recently after reading Scott Haas\'s book, _Back of the House_, our desire to dine at Cragie intensified. So we were very pleased to be able to build the dinner into our Boston/Cambridge plans last weekend.\n\nOur expectations were high, to be sure, and we are critical diners.  But this meal was a major fail.   Our concerns about the restaurant fall into two categories: the food itself and the beverage service.  After being seated and looking at the libations menu we were surprised how limited the wine list appeared -- and even more surprised that for a restaurant that showcases "American" cuisine that wines from North and South America were so underrepresented.  ( we might add that if pairings were available to complement the tasting menus this was not readily apparent).  Our consternation about the wine program grew deeper when, at the end of the meal, we were presented with a dessert menu that featured pairings.\n\nAs for the food, it must be said there was one dish that was, in fact, outstanding.  This was the squid ink and lemon-saffron conchilgie, which was perfect in all components.  This excellence stood in stark contrast with what was easily the worst dish of the evening -- Vermont pork three ways, a dish we expected would be interesting, delicious, and showcasing the chef\'s talents. Instead we were a served a burnt rib (inedible), a lifeless sausage and a pool of mustard that overwhelmed everything on the plate.  The third element, the pork schnitzel, was boring and tasteless.  We thought about this dish the following night in New York, after eating Dan Barber\'s dish of the same concept at Blue Hill.  Ideally, one would want to highlight the quality of the meat itself and bind together each varied piece with some sort of overarching unifying gustatory theme.  At Craigie we had no evidence of any thought at all and if there was skill in the preparation it was lost in this particular serving.  Our main memory of the dish is carbon and mustard.\n\nOther dishes were fairly insipid. Sweetbreads with squash allowed the latter to entirely dominate and, when one did locate a bit of sweetbread, it was soggy.  Good marks for music though, a great jazz soundtrack, and the  service was friendly.  But the food was just horrible. And the beverage program a real head scratcher.']
['Came here with my dad for a late dinner on a Friday night. I live nearby and have been dying to try this place for ages but since I am what might politely be called "economically challenged" I wanted to save it for a special occasion. My dad had also seen this place when the make-a-dish-inspired-by-a-great-work-of-New-England-literature challenge was held here on Top Chef, so he was basically just as excited as I was.\n\nWe had a 10:00 reservation but arrived around 9:15, figuring we could have a few drinks at the bar, but the hostess told us it was good we arrived so early, as the restaurant was quite crowded. She made it sound like we were going to have to wait for hours, but we hadn\'t even finished our first round of cocktails (the Hotel Street Punch for me, and the Mellow Yellow for my dad, both very good) when we were seated at a nice table near the bar.\n\nIn lieu of doing the tasting menu we decided to try a few different things. We started with the fried Essex clams, the crispy pig\'s tails, and the raw oysters. They were all incredible--the oysters fresh and briny, the clams plump and crispy with a tasty squid ink-based sauce on the side. And the pig\'s tails? Absolutely divine--almost like eating ribs, full of porky flavors with alternating crispy and tender bits. Then for an entree, we decided to split the pig\'s head. We had pig\'s head a couple months earlier at the Greenhouse Tavern in Cleveland, where the head was prepared like a barbecue, but at Craigie on Main it is prepared Peking-duck style, with a crunchy bright-pink skin, served with pancakes, pumpkin sambal, and boudin noir hoisin sauce. It was absolutely incredible, and to me far surpassed Greenhouse Tavern\'s also-excellent preparation. It was like the best of a banh mi-meets-Peking-duck, with the fattiness of the pig\'s head perfectly contrasted with the fresh, crunchy sambal and the slightly-sweet hoisin. I highly recommend it, though it does require a certain willingness to not be squeamish as it really does look like a head (a very drunk woman at the bar leaned over to us and exclaimed \'WHAT THE HELL IS THAT????\') and the eye is still included in the mandible. The way I see it, it\'s no different in terms of product than what you get shrinkwrapped at the store, and I enjoyed every minute of it.\n\nA flawless meal from start to finish. Service was prompt and considerate. I would come back in a heartbeat.']
['Another fabulous tasting menu in the books! I always imagined my first (and probably only) experience at Craigie would be for the infamous burger. Luckily, my favorite dining partner enjoys tastings as much as I do, so this first time at CoM was a special one.\n\nThe restaurant feels far homier and rustic than I expected. I loved the immediate view of the kitchen upon entering. As soon as you walk in the plating line is right in your face -- you can hear and see the chefs squabble, rush, and improvise in plain site. It\'s pretty awesome.\n\nI was a little disappointed that our table was far from the kitchen, but because of it I was able to concentrate on the two most important things: the food and my date. \n\nMy new plan of action for tasting menus is to avoid filling up on drinks. I spent a long time perusing the cocktail menu to make sure I picked the best one, as it was the only one I planned to drink throughout the evening. I ended up with the Old Cuban: Barbancourt 15 year rum, lime, mint, sugar, angostura, sparkling wine. It was perfect.\n\nDespite the 5-star rating, I have one tiny complaint with Craigie. Throughout the evening I kept wishing I had brought a pen and pad with me to take notes on the food. We noticed about halfway through that all of the other tables around us were offered a pen and paper to take notes during their meal. I\'m sure it was just an oversite, but I really do wish we had been able to take notes without have to take out our phones!  I\'ll do my best to recount our fabulous meal from memory but I\'m sure I\'m missing tons of important and unique ingredients/preparations. You\'ll just have to go see for yourself! \n\nAlmost immediately after letting our waitress know we\'d be doing the 8-course tasting, we were delivered a big basket of bread and an amuse bouche highlighting salmon and mango. After, that the courses started to roll in:\n\n1. Raw course: fluke with apricot and creme fresh\n2. Foie gras and rabbit rillette with mushrooms and toasty sourdough bread\n3. Black rockfish with oysters and mushrooms\n4. House made whole wheat noodles topped with a soft boiled egg, provolone cheese and mushrooms\n5. Sweetbreads with crispy onions and turnip\n6. Venison with brussels sprouts\n7. Basil seeds and sorbet\n- "shot" of a yummy frozen yogurt treat\n8. Two desserts to share: chocolate panna cotta with avocado and banana cream and ice cream, and I have no clue what the other dessert was, but it was delicious!\n- banana bread truffles with the bill\n\nI really loved that each course featured seasonal, local food and while presented beautifully, still had a rustic feel to it. Take a bite, close your eyes, and you could be in some New England cabin eating the deer your uncle just shot outside. Really! You could just tell this food was truly farm to table.\n\nCourse #4 (pasta) was definitely my favorite of the evening. Seriously, if I could eat that for dinner every day for the next ten years I\'d be one happy camper. The venison, rockfish, fluke and panna cotta were all at the top of the list as well. The sweetbreads were my least favorite, but that\'s just because I don\'t like sweetbreads.\n\nService from start to finish was great. Our water glasses were always full, and I think we heard from just about everyone who worked in the restaurant -- each course was presented by a different person!\n\nCraigie is an obvious high recommendation to anyone who enjoys the tasting menu experience. Save some money for a special occasion and do it up in Central Square!']
['Went in this evening and was greeted with a warm smile! The hospitality was wonderful, Ben our bartender was fantastic and very attentive. The dishes were amazing! The homemade pytoplankton pasta melted in your mouth and the fried clams were amazing! Olivia, the General Manager, connected with us at the bar and made us feel so welcome! I cannot wait to come back!']
['My husband and I absolutely love this place. The food was good to the last drop as well as the wine. The oyster was so refreshing! The bone marrow was amazing!  It was fatty but not greasy. The beef cheek was so tender that it did not require teeth. The steak was tender and flavorful with great sauce. The dessert has multiple layers of flavor. \n\nIt was also interesting to see the whole cooking process. I noticed some of the Kitchen gear was also used for my own cooking. :)\n\nThe service was super nice and our waiter gave us great recommendations. He even offered to wrap my leftover bread after I told him how much I loved them. He said the bread was specially made and not available to sell in any bakery.:( Well, I guess I have to come back again.:p']
["Service: excellent\n\nFood: Just ok\n\nGreat staff, super friendly. We had the chef's tasting menu, and it wasn't worth the price. Some of the dishes were good, but some were not. Nice ambience for a date, but overall too expensive to justify an average meal."]
['This place is just--not good. My friend and I are huge foodies and were really looking forward to trying this place after reading the reviews. Alas, we ended up being vastly disappointed.\n\nWe went with the 8 course chef\'s tasting menu. While the ingredients were fresh and high-quality, it just wasn\'t very tasty or creative. If I\'m paying $100 for a meal, I expect a certain caliber of food as well as service. Service here was just average and the ambiance was very casual. I mean, one of the dishes was pumpkin shells. Like, straight grilled pumpkin shells. Pass. The one mild standout was the venison, which we both enjoyed. The other 6 savory dishes were just okay. I mean, I just expect more from a James Beard award winner. \n\nHowever, the celery sorbet they served before the dessert was disgusting. There were little bits of celery and cheese mixed along with it and there was literally no way we could eat it, so we sent it back in exchange for some regular raspberry sorbet. The desserts were not bad, the panna cotta was just average although I enjoyed the flourless chocolate cake with miso ice cream. However, it wasn\'t anything special, just decent. Overall, we were extremely disappointed with our meal and felt it was a huge waste of our money...\n\nMy friend and I were quite confused and disappointed at all the rave reviews--"is it because it\'s Cambridge?" he puzzled. Perhaps we would have been less disappointed if we had ordered a la carte (so it would have been cheaper) but we had heard good things about the tasting menu. It genuinely confuses me that you can spend the same price on the prix-fixe menu at L\'Espalier and get food that is just on a completely different level and impeccable service. Go to L\'Espalier instead. You won\'t regret it.']
['As it\'s been years since I\'ve visited Boston, I asked friends and family for "must do" food recommendations, and this was the top pick on one of my cousin\'s lists. She called it "nose to tail seasonal eating," which I think is a great descriptor and definitely intrigued us enough to go. Easily made 6:30pm dinner reservations for this past Saturday night, and it was WONDERFUL.\n\nThe atmosphere was relaxed yet classy, the open kitchen was delightful to watch, and the service was excellent.  While you can order a la carte, they offered a 3-course prix fixe menu for $67, and 6-course and 8-course tasting menus for $100+, all of which felt reasonable to us for the complete experience. We opted for the 3-course approach and had:\n\n- First course: fried pig\'s tails, house-made pate with beets and pickled cherries\n- Entrees: grass-fed sirloin, olive oil poached salmon\n- Add-on\'s: seasonal salad, sweet roasted corn, bone marrow\n- Dessert: three flavors of sorbet, almond cake\n- Cocktails: Serius (vodka, crystallized ginger-infused honey, lemon), Shore Leave (navy strength gin, rosemary, dolin genepy, celery bitters) -- BOTH SO GREAT!\n\nIt was all incredibly delicious in that quality, savory, fresh, perfectly prepared way that makes you eat until you\'re far too full, just because you have to have more. Everything we had was fabulous, and the entire wait staff was confidently knowledgable (that especially impressed my husband), answered our questions, and shared their opinions and advice, which I always appreciate enormously, given how surprisingly rarely I find it is to encounter that kind of service. LOVED it, totally felt it was well worth the splurge, and would highly recommend!']
["If you are ready to go on a culinary adventure, Craigie on Main is your spot!  Wow, amazing food, wonderful ambiance and excellent service.\n\nI can easily say that Craigie on Main served the best meal I have enjoyed in the six plus years I have lived in Boston.\n\nTony Maws serves a lively, innovative menu that delights the senses.  If you are feeling extra spendy definitely try either the six or eight course tasting menu, you won't be disappointed.\n\nSince it was my birthday, our waitress convinced us to try the eight course tasting menu.  It was the most wonderful experience.  We arrived around 6:40 and were there until after 10 pm.  We didn't feel rushed.  The portions were perfect!  We even tried things that wouldn't normally would have not necessarily ordered from the menu, like the frogs legs.\n\nI appreciate that Craigie on Main sources many of its ingredients locally, and adjusts its menu to what is seasonally available.  They also have an extensive, interesting drink menu, so if going all out for a fancy meal isn't your thing, you can always go to the bar for something lighter and imbibe.\n\nI also have to commend Craigie on Main for their excellent service.  I found all of the serving staff to be extremely friendly and polite (not the typical upscale snobbery found elsewhere in the city).  I was pleased that the restaurant took note of my Open Table request for a corner table, which proved to be a lovely, intimate dining experience."]
["My experiences at Craigie can only be described with two words: happy tears. I've eaten here for both brunch and dinner and have never been less than completely blown away by the food. Creative, consistent, beautiful and delicious--an all encompassing world of amazingness. \n\nFor those who are scared of the price tag, check it out for brunch and get the burger. Reasonably priced and always so, so good. I also had the beef cheek, brisket and smoked beef tongue hash--freakin' incredible and topped with a perfectly poached egg. To finish brunch, had the donut. I promise you this is not just any donut--it's total perfection. Warm, toasty, covered in a creamy chocolate glaze. Seriously, you have to try it. You can start your diet tomorrow.\n\nIf you're not so scared of the price tag, try the eight-course chef's tasting. While I'll admit it is on the pricier side, it is completely worth the experience. I went with a friend and we sat at the chef's counter--it was so much fun getting to sit back, watch the open kitchen and be served dishes based on the chef's recommendations. The only thing I regret is not doing the wine pairing with the tasting (if you're going to spend the money, why not have a full experience, right?). Instead, we got a few cocktails, my favorite of which was the Civilian (a little spicy, touch of sweetness, perfectly balanced). Also really loved Ulises Abroad. \n\nEnvironment is homey and welcoming. Staff is knowledgeable without being pretentious. \n\nTip: Make reservations through opentable.com and accumulate points for dining. For a romantic date night, try to reserve the corner booth. Or to feel like you're part of the action, sit at the chef's counter and watch the open kitchen."]
["We went their for mothers' day brunch. The restaurant is quite small, so every seat was crowded together. It was hard to get out my seat and went to the restroom. However, the service was good and food was delicious. Mango smoothie and granola yogurt were tasty but the portion was quit small. The breakfast basket included cinnamon roll, lemon poppy seed muffin and donuts. For moan dished, I had the lobster, scallop, shrimp, with corn grits. My mom had bacon rapped filet with two sunny eggs. The desert is too sweet for me. However, it was a great dinning experience overall."]
['Absolutely amazing!\n\nI went here with a friend and did the 8 course tasting menu.\n\nFood: \nWhen you do the tasting menu all the food is chefs choice, so each course is a surprise. Some may find that a bit scary but I loved not knowing what was coming next and then getting to hear about each dish as it arrived. \nEach course paired well with the next. Everything tasted amazing and continued to get better and better as we went along. \nThe ingredient were fresh, food was cooked perfectly, I could not have asked for a better meal.\n\nService:\nThe service here is impeccable. From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed, like I was part of their family for the night. \nWe had several waiters as the night went on with Jesse being our main waiter. Each one was kind, polite and very knowledgeable about the food and wine we were having. Silverware was replaced between each course, water glass never went below half way and they even folded my napkin nicely when I left to go to the restroom. \nEveryone who came to our table was really fun to talk to and they really took the time speak with you. Not once did they just put the food down and run away. They took a few minutes to describe the dish and answer any questions we had. \nOne thing that really impressed me was how well they all work together as a team. Our main waiter had asked us if we had any allergies and I told him I had allergies to certain fruits that were raw but if they are cooked it was fine. Later in the evening a different waiter brought us mango sorbet and made sure to tell me the mango had been cooked. It really impressed me that he made sure to share my allergies not only with the chef but with the rest of the wait staff.\n\n\nAmbiance: \nVery clean and classic, light music playing in the background. \nOpen kitchen so you can watch the chefs as they work. \nAtmosphere was relaxed and easy to enjoy. \nI like that even though the food is so high-end you can wear jeans and still feel very welcome here. \n\n\nOver all this place is nothing short of amazing. Best meal and dining experience I have ever had. I will be sure to be back and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a great night out with good food and excellent service. You will not be disappointed here.']
['I have been to Craigie on Main on two different occasions now, and in both instances the experience has been exceptional - both from the service end, the food end.  Beyond the entrees which were all great, the drinks, appetizers and desserts were also wonderful - I would put in a very strong recommendation for the pork three ways entree, the warm apple fritter dessert, and if available the bone marrow as an appetizer. \n\nOne thing worth noting - I check in with the restaurant a few days before my reservation since I normally hear something from a restaurant asking me to confirm the restaurant.  Turns out there was a snafu on the reservation.  The host was very apologetic and immediately worked with me to find me a workable option which was very nice.']
["Really great sampling and can accommodate all pallets.  I don't like sweets and could sub food for yummy savory foods."]
['I love restaurants that are owned by people and not corporations.  So I really was excited to try Craigie on Main.  We had a party of 6 on a Saturday night - so right there - we would be a bit challenging in a Cambridge restaurant.  I thought that the food was just ok.  The octopus starter was good.  Very silky texture and interesting.  But I have had octopus that was much more flavorful before.  I ordered pork 3 ways.  It was so mediocre - the sausage was fine.  The rib was dry and not flavorful and the whole thing lacked taste except for lots of salt on everything including the pear dessert which was so gross we sent it back.  My friend ordered the whole pig head that comes Peking Duck style with pancakes and hosin sauce and that was amazing.  But you have to be ok eating a whole pig head.  Desserts were sub par at best.  This was a pricey dinner and it was merely OK.  I would never go back even on a less crowded night.  We wanted the burger but of course it was sold out hours before.  The thing I will say is - that Craigie on Main was pretentious and full of itself - including our waiter.']
["I've been here a couple times now and Craigie does not disappoint. Pricey as hell but so tasty. This is on my list as one of a few restaurants in Cambridge/Boston that really knows how to handle it's animal fat.\n\nThe first time I came here, I ordered the prix fixe from the regular menu with some apps on the side. This was the first time I had ever tried bone marrow and I was left wanting more. They brought out what must have been 2 or 3 bones cleaved in half with the marrow glimmering under the understated lighting. I was there with three other friends but I probably ate more than my share of the marrow. Other stand outs from that evening were the orange beignets and the octopus.\n\nLast time, I came with the bf for a nice dinner out. We came ready to order the chef's tasting menu but took a peek at the a la carte menu instead...obviously looking for the bone marrow but we were severely tempted to share the confit milk-fed pig's head. I asked our waitress about the bone marrow and she said the kitchen had run out and didn't have enough to put it on the menu. That got me down a bit but not too much because we were definitely getting the tasting menu and I had just ordered a cocktail with bourbon in it. The makings of the best Sunday night ever.\n\nThe tasting menu is lovingly crafted. It started with some lighter seafood fare working up to heavier sea food, pasta, duck, oxtail, and mushrooms. There isn't a wine pairing for the tasting menu but the staff is more than happy to recommend some. The featured wines-by-the-glass are supposed to go well with the meal but we decided we were happy with our cocktails to start. One of the lighter dishes included some oysters topped with roe and a light citrus sauce that really left an impression on me from how light and airy it felt. I very much enjoyed the warmth and heartiness of the the seasonal pasta with mushrooms featuring some local fungi that you don't see too often at restaurants. But, of course, the surprise was when our waitress brought out some glistening bone marrow with bread for us. I almost cried.\n\nCraigie knocks it out of the park in all areas. Consistently novel and delicious plates, fantastic service, a quaint ambiance, and a pretty killer cocktail menu to boot. Definitely one of my favorite fancy night out spots anywhere."]
['If you want to ball out  for someone, this place is THE best date night ever. They have this 6 course tasting menu that is just absolutely delicious. The service is beyond amazing. I hate seafood but the atmosphere was so lovey-dovey that I just said "f-it" and tried duck for the first time in my life here- it was amazing. The whole experience is amazing and I was totally blown away and it takes a lot for me to be impressed.']
['The food was ok. I just had much higher expectation because the price is so high. The menu was also unclear with the price and I thought there was a special price for two main courses... but "two main courses" really means a set of menu options meant for two people. They also messed up our side dish order for ramp kimchi and charged us $10 for a bowl of fiddleheads which are just weeds in my opinion. My expectations were so high. I feel they are just ripping off Cambridge now based on fame from some amazing experience they offered 2 years ago.']
["What's not to like about this place. The decor/atmosphere is well done, staff is friendly, attentive and the food was spectacular.\n\nWas treated to this restaurant for a recent birthday and had high expectations, and the did not fail. To me service is almost as important as the food and Craigie's was flawless. Knowledgable wait staff who genuinely wanted to enhance your dining experience.\n\nAs far as the food, superb. Highly recommend the 'crispy pigtails.' They were topped with the best onion strings I've ever had and teriyaki type sauce that was incredible. Also recommend the 'pork three ways.'  Perfectly cooked and incredibly tasty. This place is pricey but you absolutely get what you pay from with high quality food and service. Will definitely be back."]
['Craigie On Main has been on my Yelp bookmark list forever...and now I can finally join the Craigie Club and say, "been there, done that." For my bf\'s birthday last weekend, we went all out and ordered the 8-course tasting menu for two.\n\nCourses:\n- ceviche (amuse bouche)\n1. scallop sashimi with sunchoke and microgreens\n2. roasted striped bass and red cabbage\n3. red chile and sesame-marinated kona kampachi kama (yellowtail collar)\n4. house-made pasta in ragout sauce\n5. venison two-ways: seared tenderloin and roasted medallion\n6. pork belly and poached egg\n7. orange sorbet &amp; yogurt (palate cleanser)\n8. dessert two-ways: milk chocolate panna cotta with corn tortilla ice cream and avocado-banana puree; chocolate-fernet branca cremeux with tarragon ice cream and lemon puree\n- caramel candies, with the bill\n\nOverall, it was a memorable dining experience and we felt like happy fat pigs at the end. I\'m docking a star for minor issues: overly salty sides in a couple dishes, and #4 (pasta) simply appeared to be a struggle plate - legit looked like tiny worms, still cleaned my plate though. Meanwhile, my fave courses were: #3 (kama) the aroma nearly made me fall off my seat! It tasted as good as it smelled too - the flakiness of the skin, the tender meat, the vibrant flavor, and the chile sauce were heaven in my mouth. Other favorite was #8 (desserts)...OMFG, I died. BEST desserts I\'ve had in a while, and I eat a lot of sweets...see my muffin top?\n\nNo hiccups with the service, and the timing was perfectly paced. Ambiance was not as upscale/stuffy as Clio or Menton; instead, it had a cozy and rustic feel that worked for a special occasion.\n+1 for the birthday candle with the desserts :) love it when restaurants remember the little details.\n\nFor next time (and I foresee many next time\'s in the future):\n- request booth seating\n- try the famous burger\n- drink myself silly with their libations. #$%^&amp;...WHY did I order wine this time?!\n- save room for desserts, plural\n\nUntil next time, Craigie.']
['The Local Grass-Fed Beef Burger at Craigie on Main is one the hardest burgers to get in the United States. A secret menu item limited to only 18 burgers a night. I showed up early to wait to enjoy this combination of Shelburne Farm cheddar, mace ketchup, house-made bun, and house-smoked bacon.\n\nThe bun is tender, beef is juicy, bacon is salty, and the pickles pack a punch. The onions are sliced thin, which is good for the texture. The final toppings on the burger are a melted slice of cheddar...and some lettuce which may be better left off (however it added a splash of color for my photo). My only issue with my burger was that the house-smoked bacon was a little tough (almost like beef jerky), however I loved its peppery flavor. All of these flavors work together brilliantly and the taste of the meat is the star. The meat is very juicy, tender and perfectly cooked. The ketchup, pickles, cheese, and bacon create a savory palette that complements but never overpowers the beef. \n\nThis is probably one of the best burgers in Boston, and one of the best in the country if the bacon was not so tough like the burger I experienced.']
["What a disappointment. I had been many years ago and absolutely loved it! But I guess Tony is resting on his laurels and really nothing innovative and or unique here anymore. My wife took me for my recent birthday and we went with the Chefs menu. Despite being asked for dislikes and or allergies I got exactly the ONLY two things I don't like! Don't bother asking if you dont listen anyway! The main course of venison was lukewarm, the homemade pasta nothing to write home about! And seriously, a unimaginative cookie for dessert? Spending almost 300 bucks for that was a huge waste of money, I'd rather go to Kirkland Tap and Trotter and have an awesome burger (6 times :)  Service was good tho!"]
['Went here for my husbands birthday. The food was good with nice presentation and just right time in between the meals despite restaurant being packed. The waitress we had was awesome (short, curly hair) and gave good suggestions on non-alcoholic cocktails. There is a separate room/bar area as well where I arranged a surprise gathering of his friends afterwards.']
["One of my favorite places; I've been a regular for years. The food rarely disappoints. The whole hog dinners used to be the best. Unfortunately, for as long as I remember, service has been consistently unrefined, clunky, absent and, at times, rude."]
["I met some friends here for brunch on a Sunday morning a few months ago.  I don't like breakfast food, but agreed to go because I've found most brunch menus have multiple non-breakfast options.  \n\nHere, my only choice was to get a burger.  So I got a burger, and it was ok.  Nothing memorable.  Extremely overpriced.  Waiter and menu both oozed pretentiousness.  I have absolutely no desire to return here."]
['Simply not possible to review less than 7 stars. Yes it was a rainy Friday evening, yes my buddy and his girlfriend were impossibly impatient and hungry. Yes, after one hour and one half of waiting on the ridiculously too slanted ramp into the bar area, we were seated at the bar. Three in the wolfpack, the dinosaur bones full of marrow with toasty french baguette served the amazingly simple purpose of defeating the impending doom of helplessness following such a long wait. \n\nThe burgers arrive. I say no more, they were as good as noted in the 422 reviews before this one. These folks know what is up, they know how to do it well. And you shall return for sunday nights chef tasting menu. Can not be beat, this burger has flavoring and substance beyond your wildest imagination. Go quickly, the run out of meat some times!']
["Not cheap but worth the experience. We had a delicious meal for 6 co-workers. The service was outstanding, but the sommelier didn't do the best wine recommendations. The atmosphere was impeccable and the food was just amazing. We had a variety of dishes from oysters and octopus to sirloin and swordfish. You could pick the fixed price menu and choose from a wide range of dishes or just pick the tasting menu for all the table."]
['I went here with a friend for my 31st birthday and was definitely very impressed by our whole experience.  Experience is the best way to describe the culinary adventure my friend and I took.  We ordered the 8 course "Craige on Main Experience"sampler.  Every dish was a wonderful surprise-- full of flavor, just the right amount of heat and perfect sizing to enrich even the discerning palate.  Every  night the sampler changes-The highlight of the meal for me was the salmon--busting with flavor.  The salmon slides into your mouth and you just want more and more of it.  Every part of the meal was a joy.  \n\n\nThe service was beyond exceptional. The wait service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable about wines.  We were waited on no less than 6 different people-- all ready to fill up our cups of water at less than  a moments notice.  I highly recommend this gem of a place.  I only regret that it has taken me this long to discover this wonderfully inventive and friendly place. If you want an experience to remember look no other place than Craige on Main. I can\'t wait to return and make new memories.']
["**UPDATE**\n\nI went here again to try their tasting menu with a friend.  Apparently it was a special occasion for him (his bday) and I was oblivious to this.  We made no reservations and were able to walk in which was nice.  Would have liked the seating that looks into their open kitchen.  We sat at a high table near the bar area.\n\nThis place is supposed to be known for cooking outside of the box instead of what you'd traditionally expect.  Although I did appreciate the meal... and everything did taste good.. I was not over the moon about anything.  I did like the extra dessert courses but I was so full at this point I could barely eat anything.  The company was the best and that doesn't come with the restaurant.. so, too bad.. you're out of luck.\n\nI still hate the parking situation around here.. it's annoying to find anything on the street.\n\nI did hear that the hamburger is the best here but they only sell 20 per night and it's only sold at the bar.\n\n**************************************************************************\n\nThis restaurant is about a 3.5 star place for me... it's not the best I have ever had... but it's not bad.  It's way better than No. 9 Park... the flavors go together better.. but it just isn't omg, I have to come back here soon for a special occasion pronto!\n\nFirst off.. the cocktails were really good.  If I could rate them, I would give it a 5 star.  They don't sound good when you read it on paper.. but they taste good.  I think I got the popular Northern Lights.. and this other drink they had that tasted like lemonade... stick to the top of the cocktail list because they go from sweet to really bitter.  Well.. if you're girly like me.  :)\n\nOnto the food... they provided an amuse bouche for free.  The squid noodles were good and had an Asian flavor.. then they gave us this tiny plate with some sort of sausage.  It wasn't that good and tiny!\n\nWe went for the prix fixe.  \n\nI tried the fried clams with the squid ink (which was okay but nothing special.. the squid ink wasn't that good compared to Ten Tables.. and certainly not any better than getting fried clam strips in the summer from a cheaper place).  \n\nThe sashimi appetizer was pretty good.  Six pieces that was perfect for sharing.  \n\nFor the main course.. we went for the pig's head to share.  I thought it was a euphenism... umm.. literally they brought us half a pig's head.  It had teeth!  Although the meat was tender.. it was mostly fat.  We are both Asian so we were adventurous.. but it was served Peking duck style.  I liked the bean sprouts and sauce with it.. the eyes tasted like fish eyeballs.  But honestly.. it was kind of gross.  We saw the bill and saw this dish is $130!  Wow!  Maybe next time we should be less adventurous and go with steak next time..\n\nThe dessert was... a hit and miss.  Tried the banana mille feuille.  So.. I thought there would be more layers than two.  I nearly laughed.. but it was good.  The banana was carmelized just right.  Good...\n\nThen we got a milk chocolate something... the next thing on the menu.  That was not good.  The nuts were carmelized well but we didn't really like the ice cream or brownie or whoppers it was served with.\n\nOverall... a decent find.  But 3.5 stars.  Oh.. and this place is sooo difficult to find parking at!"]
["Everything about our dinner was perfect. \n\nMy fiance and I went for the burgers, got there at 5:25 on a Tuesday and found a line waiting to get in. Well worth it. We sat at the bar, service was prompt and friendly. We ordered beers, burgers and ribs. Even the beers here are great, and the atmosphere is just right -- busy, bustling, but not too loud. \n\nThe ribs were amazing, and had awesome onion strings with them. The burgers came and they were absolutely ridiculously good. Juicy and cooked just right and perfectly seasoned. The food is expensive but worth it -- totally worth it. \n\nThe bartenders were phenomenal -- it was like they were reading our minds, because we had everything we needed super fast, but it never once felt like they were hovering or interrupting us. \n\nWe wrapped up what we couldn't finish and, as we do at every restaurant, we forgot it. But walking to our car, literally 2 blocks away by now, we heard someone yelling behind us, and turned around and saw the hostess -- in a skirt and flats, booking it down the street with our food. So nice, so above and beyond! And she was so funny about it. \n\nThat really sealed it for us -- this place is awesome, everyone should go here, and we'll definitely be back. \n\nI wish I could give more than 5 stars."]
['I had the grilled octopus wirh the chorizo puree; well grilles piece of octopus. Plenrtful appetizer, could have been a main course. The octopus had a nice searing and there was a hint of garlic and olive oil that left a nice after taste. For my main course i had the sirloin which was nicely done to medium temperature. Well seasoned with the side of  bone marrow and brussels sprouts. Dessert was very intricate as i picked the black sesame chocolate bar...truly remarcable dessert. I dare to say my appetizer and dessert were in line with expectations which is not the sane way i felt about the main course. Overall it was an expensive experience but a must have none the less']
['This time I went with the bar menu burger. I admit that this is a great burger. I got the egg and bacon which put it over the top. This establishment is one of the greats!']
["Seriously this is easily one of the top 5 on my list of greatest dinners ever. We did the 8 course tasting menu and every dish was a delight. We started with amazing cocktails from their expert staff at the bar. We were quickly seated to a table near the bar. The ambiance was exactly what you want from a restaurant like this and the food was the star. Monica our server was a great guide and led us through an amazing experience. I was very impressed with all of the food and each course came out timed perfectly and each delivery was well described. Can't wait to go back."]
["Love, love, love! We went for the first time a few weeks ago for my boyfriends birthday. We decided to splurge and we both went for the 8 course tasting menus. It was a little nerve racking letting the chef plan the full meal, but I recommend going for it. It was exciting waiting to see what would come to the table next. The flavors, variety and presentation were impeccable. In addition to the amazing food, the service was stellar. We had an wonderful server that was down to earth and didn't make us feel foolish for asking what some of the ingredients were. Can't wait for another special occasion to go back!"]
['Come here for the tasting menu at night. The chefs serve you random plates of delicious concoctions in a 6 course meal. The lobster soup was exquisite. Everything was exquisitely made, actually, from the first appetizer to the doughnut balls for dessert. \n\nThe waitresses and waiters were very professional. Craigie on Main should get awarded for their professional waiter service,  because not only were they accommodating, helpful, and friendly, but they treated you like an old friend. \n\nI would definitely come again.']
["Superb! We had the chefs tasting menu and it was one of the best, most innovative meals I ever had. We ate at the chefs table overlooking the kitchen and it was like watching a symphony perform: everyone playing their uniquely important role (and playing it very well). And of course service was great too - our waiter recommended 3 great pairings (bubbly, white, and red) to go along with the tasting menu. We'll be back!! Thank you, Craigie on Main."]
['Had dinner here and got the tasting menus. Very cool assortment of dishes. I thought each course built very well. My favorite ones were the butter poached halibut and the filet mignon! On top of that, the drinks are top notch. I loved their version of the Aviation.']
["The legend of the Craigie on Main burger. So we heard legends of the burgers here - not on the menu, only a certain number pre-made a night, and only served from the bar. So, for my girlfriend's birthday, we set up to get some. I called ahead and asked - he said the doors open at 5:30, so it's best to get there at 5:20 (enough time to get a good spot in line) and as long as you're part of the first set of ppl into the bar (both the bar itself and the tables near the bar), you shouldn't have trouble getting the burger.\nIt was a miserable freezing rain day. My girlfriend wanted to take our time as it was such miserable weather, but I said we are NOT messing this up - we DESERVE those burgers. So we got there at 5:20, right as like 4 other groups of ppl walked up. One was a group of 8 - but they already had reservations, so we didn't have to worry about them.\nWe walked right in, straight to the bar, and let the waitress know we were interested in burgers. I'm sure they hear this all the time - frantic ppl making sure to get on the list for burgers.\nAnyway, we perused the menu, ordered some brussels sprouts as an appetizer, and got the burgers with fries. Bottom line: all the food was pretty great. The burgers (there is actually a recipe near the bathroom - so you can see the numerous ingredients in them, including beef, bone marrow, brisket, etc) were great. I eat a LOT of burgers and really enjoyed these. They melted in your mouth, but not all over your face. And full of all sorts of delicious carcass-y flavors. I added bacon, came with cheese, fixins, and a delicious sauce. We were both super happy.\nBurger came with some thick steak fries that I believe were cooked in a truffle oil. Also pretty great. \nAdditionally, the brussels sprouts were really good - very well flavored/spiced, and cooked in this almost burnt/crispy/moist way that I can't do on my own no matter how hard I try.\nAlso drank some beer and wine with dinner - nice assortment of wine. Food was pricey, but worth every penny."]
["Excellent food and service. Extremely overpriced for what's received - the serving sizes were insultingly small. The six course tasting menu is $98 so dinner for two plus alcohol and tip was around $350. If you enjoy remaining hungry after eating 'dinner' and find great pleasure in throwing your money away go to Craigie on Main. This is a great example of a restaurant that began with an incredible reputation, has remained notable for too long and is now cutting the fat. Again delicious cuisine and great waitstaff but I entered the restaurant feeling like I was going to purchase a Mercedes and drove off in a Datsun."]
['I recently had a great brunch here on a Sunday morning.  There was a large party that day, so we just sat at the bar.  The bar tender was nice and attentive.  We started with the House-made Donut and Confiture du Lait (Condensed Milk Jam) -- who doesn\'t like a good donut?!  Then I tried the Grass-Fed Beef "Tongue and Cheek" Hash and Smoked Sablefish Hash, both with a Slow-Poached Egg.  I was a little wary about the beef tongue, but it was seasoned well and tasted like delicious brisket.\n\nThe girl next to us got the Beef Burger, which sounds simple, but it looked liked America\'s Most Wanted Burger.  It makes vegetarians want to eat it.  I am not a vegetarian, but I also wanted to eat it.']
["I came here with my partner to celebrate his birthday and we had a wonderful experience. \n\nThe food lives up to its hype. The menu changes slightly on a nightly basis, so I'm not sure if what we ate is offered all the time. The Crispy-Fried Pig's Tails were literally one of the best things I've ever eaten. It felt kind of naughty to eat them with your hands when everyone is dressed so spiffy around you. They were sweet, tender, and crispy, and I wish I could eat them every day of my life. For an entree, I had the Grass-Fed Steak, which is a rarity for me since I don't eat a lot of red meat. It was delicious, as where the sides it came with. My partner had the Whole Wheat Conchiglie Pasta, and kept groaning in happiness at each bite. He ordered the Vermont Pork Three Ways for his entree, and wouldn't share a bite with me, which I know meant it was delicious. \n\nThe service was very pleasant, but definitely a bit slow. Other tables that sat after us were served their food before ours, even parties that we overheard making many dietary alterations. \n\nFor special occasions, Craigie is a must. Enjoy the delectable food and your company, but don't focus on the service."]
["I've dine at Craigie on Main twice now and had two somewhat different experiences.  The first time I went, I did not feel like the food, though good, justified the prices, which are steep.  I thought the ingredients were common, and the prepartions nothing special.  Upon returning, I found the ingredients still fairly unadventourous, but they had been transformed into much more exciting, and certainly delicious dishes.  \n\nThe best example of this is the chicken, which was stuffed with sausage and accompanied with a combination of fresh and cooked apricots, served in a generous portion.  Sure, the chicken is high quality, but the kitchen deserves the credit for making this humble protien extraordinary.  Similarly, the octopus app, though very traditional with green olives and chorizo, was excellently cooked, which is not something to be taken granted for at all.  \n\nFor completeness, here are my impressions of other dishes:\nSunchoke volute - outstanding, though the caveteli did much, much more for me than the cockscomb\nPork 3 ways - very nice, but nothing too exciting here\nFried smelt - good, but a big budget production that delivered more in sytle than taste\nAsparagus - very good, and the egg was delicious, but this dish was a little too plain...some multigrain breadcrums alone may made it pop more\nPig tails - excellent, even if a little pricy for what it was\nMonkfish - yawn\nChocolate marquis - truly memroable; loved the beet ice cream\nBengiets - too good \n\nSome nice other touchs worth noting: nobody does a better amuse bouche, the bread basket is quite generous--though I would gladly trade quantity and variety for the bread to be warmed up, and I was very surprised the butter wasn't salted--and I LOVED the horchatta!\n\nOverall, I find the service pleasurable, though I have experienced some mis-steps: one server that was just too familiar and casual, another that didn't alert us to specials and make multiple errors on our check.  On both visits, timing left something to be desired.  And the atmosphere is nice, but I have found it drafty on both visits.\n\nMy second meal was the best dinner I've had in serveral visits to Boston, and I found the value much better than on my first visit, so I would highly recommend it for sure to experienced diners; however, I wouldn't recommend it for a special occasion or for people that only can afford to go out occassional for expensive meals...too big a risk based on the inconsistency I experienced.  I would certainly return.\n\n(5 stars for Boston, probably only 4 in NYC...no offense anybody)"]
['I am really sad about this place. It used to be one of my favorites for dining at a table and at the bar. Even their chicken was phenomenal - better than their burger, in my opinion. But over the years everything has gone downhill quite a bit. The seasoning is more frequently off than not, and foods is sometimes overcooked, surprisingly. There are numerous other restaurants I would visit before this one. Sad face.']
["My boyfriend surprised me with a 6-course chef's choice dinner for my birthday. Apparently they do chef's choice dinners after 9PM on Sundays. I was really excited and while everything was presented beautifully, I was really let down. It was so uninspiring that I hardly remember what I ate. Nothing was terrible, but also nothing worth mentioning. Service was great and the drinks were delicious - my boyfriend loved The Grand Tour and I loved the Serius. I did enjoy my dessert - praline and nougat, but other than drinks and dessert, I was a bit disappointed in the meal. Overall, it's okay, but not worth the price."]
["This place is cool. Really pretty inside. Bar is awesome. Drinks are perfect. Everyone is very polite and friendly. Food ranges from confused and overproduced to the best fish i've ever had.\n\nI was a pretty upset that the hostess tried to seat us in the bar after I had specifically made a reservation for the dining room.  We then had to wait 15 minutes for a proper table and as I realized that she had given our table to someone else, I graduated to very upset.  My ire soon dissipated once we were sat in the dining room and I couldn't help but focus on the beautiful pork smell emanating from the open kitchen.  \n\nWe got 8 courses. \n\nthe pates were perfect\nthe sashimi was good if a little overdressed\nthe asparagus dish was trying way too hard (i did not enjoy this one)\nseafood risotto was excellent\nrabbit sausage pasta was creative and delicious\nTHE FISH HEAD OMFG THE FISH HEAD BURY ME WITH THE FISH HEAD BEST FISH HEAD IN THE WORLD MAYBE idk\nthe filet with tongue was a pretty sloppy dish imo why put tongue?? it doesn't add any flavor. I thought that the tongue was a silly distraction from what would've been a really nice dish.\nthe desserts were all fantastic but i wasn't even hungry by then.\nthe digestifs were a nice ending\n\nAt times i feel like the chef was doing way too much and needed to take a step back, but on the other hand, a lot of it was perfect.\n\nI actually would give this meal 4 stars but at $200 a head, excellent is only average.\n\nI would come back but probably just to lurk in the bar."]
["I got to try this place on my first night in Boston thanks to my brother and future sis-in-law. The food was pretty good, though the pig tails were a bit disappointing -- as much of a fan of both pork products and crispy / fried things as I am, I guess I expected more. Maybe it's intentional, but I could barely taste any meat -- it was more like eating carbon plus their sauce, which was alright. I also went with the pork three ways (see? I like pork), and while everything was cooked correctly, it didn't stand out too much either.\n\nThe other issue was that we had reservations, and still had to wait over 45 minutes before we got seated. We were all starving and it even seemed that a couple who arrived after us were seated before we were, but the staff were indifferent, borderline snobby, when we tried to ask what was going on -- we were simply told that they can't control how long people take to eat... uh, isn't that what all restaurants that take reservations do all of the time?\n\nWhat stood out was that the management reached out and genuinely seemed to want to improve the restaurant. They asked us to give them another try, and when we did everything had improved. That is how you restaurant!"]
["I needed to write a review for the exceptional experience I had with my boyfriend here this past weekend.\n\nI had heard amazing things about this place for a while, and picked it to celebrate an anniversary with the boy. I was a little hesitant about the price point and the fanciness of the place upon seeing the menu online, but wanted to enjoy the experience! We had 9pm reservations, easily accommodated and seated right away. The service was exceptional throughout the whole evening, with waitstaff bringing us out small tasting dishes, folding napkins whenever we got up, and highly attentive to any needs. Our waitress was amazing, I wish I remembered her name so she could get kudos :) \n\nWe decided on the a la carte option rather than the chef's tasting plates, every dish was amazing, fresh, and unique. I got the whole wheat pasta with the ragout for a first dish and the striped bass for my entree, the boyfriend got the salad with celery root and pork belly and the pork three ways. Most impressively, our waitress noticed that I did not eat all of my entree as the inside was slightly underdone (after she had made a point to steer me away from the salmon entree as it would be too tender for my taste). She immediately spoke to the chef, who agreed it was cooked improperly and COMPED THE WHOLE ENTREE. I certainly wasn't expecting this but felt this was an exceptional example of the service we received all night.\n\nThe night ended with two small complimentary cups of sassafrass mint tea served with a candle to end the night on a special note. I will definitely be returning here for my next special event :)"]
["Came here and splurged a bit on the Chef's Whim 6-course tasting. From an amazing amuse bouche of squid noodles to a couple more-than-satisfying desserts, everything was top-notch. First few were seafood -- the squid noodles, crab, scallop -- then faro pasta, hanger steak, ice cream and flan, a couple macaroons to round out the night. Trust the chef, he knows what he's doing. And he's very generous with the portions, we left completely stuffed.\n\nWaitress was very nice, though we did have countless servers throughout the night. Tucked away on a side street just behind Toscanini's, this place is really a gem. Makes me a happy girl."]
['Felt like a queen here. \n\nAll stops are pulled out. I loved the fried pigs tails. Will dream about for years to come. Absolutely melted in my mouth.\n\nBurger had a lot going on- not my favorite kind of meat- but I think 99% of people would disagree with me.']
['There is a phrase in my native country which means, "Oh dang, this is excellent food that I am eating," but I cannot remember it right now, nor the country to which I am referring. I have cast aside the shackles of my mortal frame, and surpassed time itself. I am adrift in the galactic void, illuminated by the pinpricks of a thousand distant  amuse-bouche.\n\nBack when I had a mouth, I salivated at the supple texture of gently seared octopus served over black ink aioli. I gazed at egg-topped veal sweetbreads with eyes that had never witnessed galactic dawn. I sniffed - oh, how I sniffed! - the aroma of duckfat-roasted squash and zucchini.\n\nHave you ever dipped your head into the churning furnace of a neutron star and drank deeply? I am not saying that Craigie\'s Improved Whiskey Cocktail provides the same fermionic rush of energy, the same purity of light from the birth of the universe itself. I am simply implying it.\n\nWho was my Virgil on this, my last flavor pilgrimage before transcendence? She called herself... Olivia. I suspect that, like Bacchus arriving at a feast swaddled in robes to conceal his identity, she was actually an emissary from the Vault of Heaven, sent to observe our lowly plane and uplift us from dullness. She showed me the Way, and the Way involved salted caramel ice cream with almond nougat and a thin chocolate shell.\n\nThe Chef\'s Counter, a primordial altar that was presumably dug up by an expedition to the lunar surface, offers a glimpse into the whirling waltz of the kitchen staff. They move like water in low gravity: turbulent with purpose, still with precision. They are the Watchers in the Night, the Stones at the End of the Road, the Mayors of Flavortown.\n\nCome join us, fledgling mind. We are everywhere and everything. But mostly we\'re at Craigie On Main, stuffing our simulacrums of faces. We\'re waiting for you.']
["Came in early for our reservation and was invited to the kitchen table due to last minute cancellation. Hooray! I was mesmerized by the open kitchen, the energy, the synchronicity, the spotlessness. \n\nWe opted for the 3 course prix-fixe...and really was impressed with everything, starting from the razor clam amuse to the tender monkfish, melt-in-mouth pork belly, and silky citrus parfait. The only thing that was a bit disappointing was the orange blossom beignets, which were dense and the caramel stuffing too cloyingly sweet for our taste. I couldn't really taste the orange blossom advertised at all. \n\nAside from the food, service was attentive &amp; friendly. Our server looked like Argo-Ben Affleck...so no complaints :) Next time, I'm gonna starve myself for 3 days and get the pig head."]
['Very good, in general.  On this date, however, the flavors seemed a bit too concentrated and salty.  The Salmon poached in olive oil was likely unnecessary as it was like eating a salmon terrine rather than salmon itself.  The vegetarian potato galette with roasted vegetables was delicious.\n\nCramped and noisy as we sat next to a long table of 12.  I would go back again, though would wait a time as their small menu is limited.']
["a perfect hearty brunch was had at craigie on main. no complaints here from the service  to the food to the bill. we started with (and i don't recommend missing) the donut with cajeta (a thick carmel-y sauce) which was devoured in seconds. \n\nour main course of brunch was the grass-fed beef cheek and smoked beef tongue hash served with a soft egg and topped with delicate crispy onion rings. i was hesitant at first to order this dish only because i am not a huge fan of tongue or organ meats but our waitress assured us that the tongue was braised long enough that it was just melt in your mouth tender and not chewy or strong flavored. in the mood for heartier fare on a cooler fall day in which i was ever so slightly hung over, i decided to trust her guidance and was happy that i did. the meat was diced in small cubes (think hash) and was melt in your mouth as promised. i only wished there was more of it. the bloody mary that i washed it down with was also noteworthy. \n\nthe burger (which is one of the things that craigie is known for) was well seasoned and cooked perfectly. it was also topped with an egg because isn't everything better with an egg these days?\n\ni felt like we couldn't come all this way to not have desert. we ended our meal with coffees and the sweet corn pannacotta with berry coulis, spiced blueberry sorbet and cornbread crumble. we were fighting over the last bite. nice cool, refreshing bites of sorbet and creamy pannacotta - perfect for ending our amazing meal. \n\none of the other menu items that was recommended to me by the waitress were the shrimp and hominy. a house favorite and a dish the chef takes pride in making himself.  \n\nreservations recommended - this place was packed on a sunday morning."]
["Tony Maws, Rick Ross, BAWS (pronounced 'boss'). The head chef doesn't blink, flinch, or change facial expressions as he captains his ship. Tony must have a heart made of stone, because if something isn't done to perfection when he randomly samples it then into the sea it goes. Its heartbreaking considering there are so many homeless people right down Mass ave, but I guess it'd be heartbreaking to patrons who would have to pay $96 for the 6-course tasting menu. Thankfully, my boss/PI gave me a $100 gift card to Craigie on Main which was used\n\nAs awkward as this may sound, Tony will do things with your tongue that you didn't know were possible. Its like poprocks for adults, the tasting menu is absolutely insane, and you'll be appreciating every bit of thought that goes into every dish. You can taste nothing but quality for every course. Its worth mentioning that the tasting menu seems to heavily rely upon seafood, so if seafood isn't your thing like mine, make it known to your server.\n\nService is excellent, what else would you expect? Portions on the tasting menu might seem small, but they keep you busy with bread and water in between. I remember barely being able to make the 5 minute walk home with my wife because we were very full. Its not satiating in the same way that a big Chipotle burrito is, its satiating because you get to try all these unique tastes. I'm usually against places that have small portions, but Craigie On Main is really special.\n\nIf you appreciate different flavors and cooking styles, check out Craigie On Main. The tasting menu is bold and adventurous, but even the regular menu is great. Its something that is worth trying at least once."]
["I came with the bf for the Chef's Whim, available Sunday nights after 9pm, during our trip to Boston. It's like the American version of omakase, where the chef chooses what to serve you based on what he feels like making and feels is the best for the night. I had originally been told that I would be sitting at the chef's counter, which overlooks the open kitchen, and had been super excited about that, but when we arrived there happened to be an open table so we were seated there instead. Ah well, a table made the meal seem more intimate anyways. The decor gives a feeling of being in someone's living room, with the some bookshelves and vintage serveware decorating the area, as well as some vintage posters decorating the walls. Very homey.\n\nSince it's been awhile, I don't remember all the specific dishes we had, but I do remember them being very well executed. There were some that I remember enjoying immensely, and others that, though I knew it was done very well, just didn't fit my palate. Overall though, it was a wonderful experience, the food was good, and I am pleased to have been able to try one of these classical institutions."]
['I\'m going to just say this:\n\nThe Burger. \n\nHoly. Shit.\n\nOK, context: you know that episode of "How I Met Your Mother" where Marshall is trying to find the perfect burger in New York that he once had? Yeah, I think that place that served those burgers simply picked up their shit and moved up to Cambridge. Because THIS IS THAT PLACE.\n\nWhen you get the burger (and you WILL get the burger), make sure you just get the burger. Don\'t get the fucking egg on it, don\'t get any weird shit. Don\'t fuck with perfection. OK, if you\'re one of those hipster assholes who has to get bacon on everything, get bacon. Just... I don\'t know, get it on the side. Here is why:\n\nThis burger is magic on a bun, garnished with fresh garden vegetables. The patty is made up of shoulder chuck, hanger, marrow, suet, and sirloin tips. LISTEN TO ME: make absolutely sure you get it very rare, because that is the only way to enjoy this combination of meats. It\'s like the chef just makes the patty, throws it on a slab of stone, passes it over with a blowtorch for ten seconds, goes: "OK, done!!" and puts it on a bun in front of your face. \n\nHonestly, I have no idea what Craigie on Main\'s other food is like because, well... see above. Why would you want to get anything else? Granted, it is pricey, and unless you get there at juuuuuuust the right time, you will have to wait in a long line, plus they might run out of The Burger. So plan accordingly.\n\nBut otherwise, that\'s all there is to say. You must Obey The Burger. Go eat one right now.']
["A little tough to get a reservation, but finally had the chance to do dinner here. The atmosphere is nice; trendy, somewhat quaint and buzzing with staff and full tables. Initial impression is that it's a casual semi-upscale restaurant, but having three different servers (for some reason) seemed a little over kill. I would expect that from an old school shirt and tie place, not a semi-hipster bistro in Cambridge.\nThe menu choices are somewhat limited. Either the Craigie's  experiences @ $98 and $130 or the Prix-Fix of three courses at $67. We chose the prix-fix. Without getting into the details of the actual dishes, our first thought was that there were too many ingredients in every plate, almost unnecessarily so. This didn't mean that it all didn't taste good, but the question was why all the fancy ingredients - seemed a little pretentious. \nThough everything did taste good, unfortunately it followed (10 minutes after leaving) with some pretty bad stomach ache and nausea. No doubt due to something I ate."]
["#16 of 52 in 2014.\n\nThere is a lot of hype about this place, so we had to try it.\n\nIt felt very much like a lot of the other new, trendy restaurants I've been to lately in boston.\n\nSmart looking wait staff. Artisan cocktails. Pork belly.\n\nAnd the food was good. \n\nI guess I just wasn't totally wowed by anything in particular."]
['I\'ve been to Craigie on Main three times and each experience was absolutely fantastic -- but last night was full.stop.amazing. \n\nWe booked a reservation for two for our anniversary and even managed to get the "Ringside Seats" for a front row seat to the kitchen. As soon as we arrived and sat down, we were greeted with two complimentary glasses of champagne and very sweet, "Happy Annviersary!" wish - it was an unexpected, classy touch that set the tone for the entire dinner. \n\nWe took our time settling in (plan on spending time here - we were there for 3 hours enjoying everything). To kick things off, we ordered a French 75 and an Old Fashioned - both of which were utterly amazing. During my past visits to Craigie, I\'ve sat at the bar and have seen how much care and precision goes in to each cocktail - and you can really taste it. Our tag-team waitress duo, Monica and Tatiana, made sure we never wanted for anything and let us take our time, which we really appreciated since it was a special night. When we did make our choices, Monica helped pick out a fantastic bottle from their selection of Old World wines. \n\nThe kitchen sent a complimentary amuse-bouche to prime our pallettes that included three tastings of beets, fish and scallops. For an appetizer we had the charred octopus and oysters and for dinner the pork three ways. There\'s no other way to say it - the food is the best you\'ll have in Boston. Subtle notes coming together perfectly punctuated by surprising bursts of flavor in all the right places. \n\nWhen dessert came out, Monica and Tatiana brought out a candle and a sazerac digestif to cap off a fantastic night. \n\nYes, it\'s expensive. But you\'d never think twice about spending that $300-$400 for a dinner for two with such excellent service and such breathtaking food. \n\nInsider Tip: If you like eating at the bar like we do, Craigie is the place to do it. Bar patrons aren\'t allowed to mill about behind bar - diners, which keeps it classy.']
["Good but not great; somewhat overrated, based on my experience and what I've heard. The food would be a 4, but I've docked one star due to the price (expensive!).\n\nAs for the food itself, my favorite thing we ate was actually the monkfish liver amuse-bouche."]
["Boston owns a large piece of my heart.  Before traveling back to this beloved city I did some serious research.  I kept hearing and seeing things about Craigie on Main.   As I continued to come across rave reviews  I began to be afraid that COM would inevitably disappoint in some way...how could any place live up to the hype?...especially with an 8 course tasting menu for $118!  I only pay that kind of money a few times a year for a meal, so I was excited, anxious, and terrified that I would be disappointed.  CRAIGIE ON MAIN DID NOT DISAPPOINT IN ANY WAY!  HANDS DOWN THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE!\n\nThe place is very non-assuming and down to earth on the outside.  We walked in on a weeknight and were incredibly glad that we had reservations.  Inside the ambiance is wonderful!  A sense of life and enjoyment fill the restaurant.  I loved that you could be at home in casual attire...It's about the food here, not pretentiousness. We were a several minutes early so went to the bar for a drink.  I don't remember what I ordered, but it had gin and sage...and it told my pallet to wake up and be ready for an astonishing evening.\n\nThe service was on-point!  The team that waited on us was one of the best we've ever had.  We order the 8 course tasting menu and explained that we prefer red wine, especially interesting blends.   We were incredibly pleased with a Grenache/Carignan/Syrah/Cinsault blend that allowed the cinsault to make beautiful contributions of depth and balance.\n\nThe 8 courses were fantastic!  We were so pleased with the overall meal.  Nothing fell short, and several items truly wowed us!...and the Chef sent out and a couple extra bites between corses.\nSome of our favorites:\nSeared scallops and scallop roe served with broth\nSlow-Roasted Sea Trout with peekytoe crab and artichokes\nHouse-Made Spaghetti with chicken thigh confit, farm fresh egg, guanciale, and chicken liver cream\nVeal Three Ways: Braised Short Ribs, Grilled Tongue, Roasted Sweetbreads \nPeanut butter ice cream with peanut butter cookie, served with a muscat syrup and foam\n\nThere is no other way to put it, than to say that we were continually awed and amazed!  Like I said, best meal of my life...better than a few of the Las Vegas Michelin Star Restaurants that I love eating at!  The food at COM is real, satisfying, genuine, incredibly balanced, and memorable!"]
["We went to Craigie on Valentine's Day, and they had a special Prix Fixe menu of 5-courses and we elected to do the 5-course wine pairing to go with it.\n\nWe were greeted warmly and the hostess took our coats immediately at the door. The table was nicely decorated with paper hearts and there was a fresh rose waiting which I thought was a nice touch. The service remained extremely attentive, friendly and professional throughout the entire meal.\n\nBoth of us started with Sashimi which was very well-prepared. This was paired with a champagne cocktail which was a fun way to start the evening. Next I had a pork and pear salad, followed by a lobster, truffle and beet pasta. I decided on the Red Miso-Marinated Venison with blood orange marmalade for my dinner. It was cooked to perfection and had a very complementary wine pairing. We finished with a chocolate extravaganza for two which was a nice mix of small dessert samplings.\n\nOverall the experience was fantastic. It was clearly a bit pricey ($400 for the dinner + wine pairing) but it was worth it and I think we will return on a non-holiday when prices are a bit more reasonable."]
["This review is for the hamburger only.\n\nI am not a hamburger connoisseur, but the burger here is worth getting in some trouble over. It's made with three cuts of meat, bone marrow, and suet. It's just large enough in size to make one ever so slightly concerned with a single serving consumption of it. But please, *please* don't leave any on the plate or try to bring some home. Just eat this delicious burger and get over yourself.  If this isn't the food highlight of your week, you must be living pretty large, bro.\n\nI would go into details about how perfectly balanced the fat of the burger and crunch of the bun was, or how the flavor of each bite was different and surprising, but then I would be that girl talking about burger like it was the best sex of her life. While that may be true, I'm not yet ready to take that step."]
["Since I moved to Boston, I wanted to see if the legends are true. All of my food-conscious friends talked Craigie up, and I finally had a chance to go.\n\nIt was brunch, and it was insanely good. The deets:\n\n1. We started off with coffees and a cappuccino. All were great.\n\n2. Appetizers were several of the house-made donuts and the granola and house-made yogurt. The yogurt and granola was good, but didn't knock my socks off. That was the donuts' job. Holy hell... those donuts. I've dreamt of them every night since. Delicious chocolatey sugar-coated nuggets of pastry goodness, smothered in an uber-rich cajeta. I licked the plate. Actually.\n\n3. My girlfriend got the roasted veg entree. It came with scrambled eggs and salsa verde and was very good. I only had a bit, but the veggies were awesome and the eggs were ridiculously creamy.\n\n4. My friend got the beef cheek and tongue hash. An egg an crispy onions completed the dish, and from what I could tell by my single bite, it was delicious. The cheek and tongue were melt-in-your-mouth tender.\n\n5. My dish... oh my... my dish was the shrimp and hominy. On the menu it's scallops and crab, but mine was rock shrimp instead. The hominy is from Anson Mills and in itself is a nearly transcendent experience. The shrimp were plump, plentiful, and delicious. The egg was perfectly runny. The red chili broth/sauce was super flavorful with just enough spice, and the radishes offered a nice textural changeup. To make a relatable comparison, this dish was the best pozole I've ever eaten, but with shrimp instead of pork. It. Was. Insane. If it's available, you need to order it.\n\nThe legends are true. Craigie's reputation precedes it. The service is impeccable, the food is great, and all the good things you've ever heard are true. Next time, I'll be there for dinner, and I cannot wait."]
['Came to get drinks at the bar, which were really good. The bartenders were really nice and although it was crowded at the small bar, we never really had to wait long to get drinks. I think 2 out of the 3 drinks I had there were things that the bartender whipped up because nothing looked promising on the drink menu. Thanks, bartender whose name I didn\'t catch! \nGot kind of hungry so decided to split the brussel sprouts and famous Craigie burger! I\'ve been hearing about this burger for so long and I was really curious to try what multiple foodie sources have named "best burger in Boston." I honestly have not tried enough burgers in Boston to know if this is true, but I have to say the Craigie burger was delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, and I liked the texture of the bun. Sure, it wasn\'t as "creative" as some of the other burgers I\'ve tried elsewhere, but I don\'t think a burger has to include a bunch of high-end, exotic ingredients or be doused in inventive sauces for it to be amazing. As my English teacher in high school said: "Keep It Simple, Stupid" (KISS). Not that I\'m not a fan of the out-there burgers of Bartley\'s, for example. I must admit though that the fried egg made it extremely messy to eat, which was slightly embarrassing. I liked that it came with potato wedges, which I prefer over fries. \nOh yeah, they gave us amuse bouches and this little citrusy cocktail at the end of the meal. Cute.\nI\'d come back to try the food. If it\'s as good as the burger I had, then definitely worth it. But not without a reservation..it\'s a small place and it gets crowded fast! Restaurant area was full every time I got up to use the bathroom and there were people waiting for seats at the bar.']
["Outstanding. I have never left here disappointed. I can't even begin to type out the meals I have had here - I would be here all day. The best of them all was not a chefs tasting though. It was the pigs head. Holy smokes. If you like pig don't let the face freak you out it is the BEST pork meal you will ever have and the way they prepare it is absolutely flawless. So good. I haven't been to Boston in 9 months but once I get a chance to this will probably be the first place I go. I miss it so much! Its phenomenal, end of story.\n\nAlso, if you make reservations for 4 or less, request the 'ring side' seats. But really make sure they put that down on your reservation! We requested those seats when it was my birthday and I was sadly let down when we got there and saw it with four people mid meal nowhere near being done. Bummer, yes, but the food made me (almost) forget about it."]
['Craigie On Main was good, but not as good as I was led to believe based on its ratings. I can\'t speak for the brunch, but for dinner, it was neither memorable nor worth the price. \n\nAlthough we liked our food here (lamb sausage pasta, octopus salad, pork three ways, char, and swordfish), none of us found the taste to be spectacular or the dishes to be creatively prepared. Personally, I could think of at least two restaurants in the area that offer comparable food at a much lower price.  Also, the presentation of the dishes was ordinary at the best. Some of the dishes could\'ve been a bit less sloppy looking and better color coordinated. \n\nThe same could be said for the environment. It was fine, but not what I had expected from a restaurant at its price range. The setting reminded me of a $$, instead of $$$$ restaurant. Quoting a friend who also came to dinner, "they try to be high end but..." \n-It was noisy with closely packed together tables, which when moving between tables, one could\'ve easily bumped into the neighboring diners by accident. \n-Paper cloth for napkins: I\'m assuming they are disposable, which seemed a bit counter intuitive for a restaurant that emphasizes on being environmentally friendly.  \n-A constant line of people waiting to use the restroom. Given how many people the restaurants could hold, it didn\'t seem like two restrooms were enough. I know this isn\'t easily fixable, but the wait does affect the overall dinning experience.\n\nHad a similar experience with the Tasting menu. Again, it was good. But there are better tasting as well as priced restaurants.   \n\nThe bright side was that our service was good.']
["Craigie is easily one of Boston's best restaurants. I came in for the burger this week. The Craigie burger alone is the best burger in Boston. However, I'd give best burger plate in Boston to JM Curley's since Curley's pairs the perfect fries with their burger. Craigie's steak fries don't cut it. \n\nAside from burgers, we tried the octupus app which is easily the best octopus I've had anywhere. \n\nMust get back here for the tasting menu."]
["Unsurprisingly Cragie continues to be the gold standard by which every other establishment is judged. If you don't have the milk fed confit pigs head you're living an unfulfilled life. Service is engaging and the picture of poise and professionalism."]
['We went to Craigie on Main for my husband\'s birthday--a special occasion and a bit of a splurge, as we had heard great things about the food and the restaurant. \n\nWe had the eight course tasting menu. A few of the dishes were both delicious and unusual--a super fresh scallop dish with pear and herbs, a salmon jawbone in chili sauce, a slow-roasted cod with wild mushrooms. Others were odd and less flavorful--a pork confit with tough skin on the top. Some were fine but just not that interesting--the final savory course was beef with beef tongue, and was good but unremarkable. Desserts didn\'t quite come together. Mine was a bland apple pancake with a bit of pine nut butter and goji berries. It was pretty doughy and tasteless.\n\nThe big disappointment, however, was the service. Throughout, our server was brusk, rushed, and mechanical. We asked her about a wine pairing for the tasting menu, and she wandered off without giving us a direct answer. We ended up paying more than we probably would have for a bottle for a couple of half carafes of wine because we didn\'t feel like navigating the extensive winelist without a guide. At the end of the meal, she did this robotic and strange "happy birthday" to my husband in exactly the same way, at three separate moments. \n\nWe wanted to feel a lot more coddled and cared for, on a special night when we were dropping $400+. Ultimately it was decent food for an awful lot of $.']
['I absolutely love this place. Everything I have  tried have always been very flavorful, and the seasoning never extreme on either end of the spectrum. They even manage to make stir-fried Brussels sprouts incredibly tasty. Service is always great. Definitely worth trying!']
["So after posting this negative review someone from Craigie on Main reached out to me and apologized.  They even sent me a gift card for $150 to come back and try eating there again.  It took us a few months to get back there but boy am I glad we went back!  We went last night for dinner and were treated like royalty!  Our waitress was on point!  She was attentive, calm, and very knowledgeable about the food.  The menu had a lot of tastier options (personal preference) this time around and the food had some outstanding moments.  The Cepe Mushroom Ragu dish was OUTSTANDING.  I kept saying mmmm and ahhh and couldn't resist every bite.  Truly a 5 star dish.  My fiance got the fried clams to start which were sort of meh.  They were a bit of a miss, they were good but no where near as special as my dish.  Then for our main dish I got the Sirloin with the tongue and my fiance got the Chicken stuffed with sausage in a Mediterranean inspired dish.  This time my fiance's dish was a 5!  So yummy and special.  Mine was a bit confusing...while all of it was very good I felt that it should've been lamb based on the spices they used.  I give my main a 4 and his an absolute amazing 5!! Also - important to note dessert was great and on point and they even gave us free wine to pair with our desserts this time.  Our seats were also the best in the house in the corner so we can see the entire kitchen and the whole restaurant.  I feel like we must have been flagged in their internal system as patrons who complained last time and need to be treated super well this time.  Regardless it worked!  We were def super happy and overall had the experience we wanted to have the first time we came in!  Craigie has still got it and was able to turn a sour experience in the past into a truly great one!"]
["I can say that my dinner at Craigie on Main was one of the best meals of my entire life. And I've had a lot of good food. But no meal has struck me as so creative, so flavorful, and just so darn delicious in a very very long time. Worth every cent. Thank you to the Chef, Tony Maws. That James Beard award was well deserved!\n\nWe weren't too hungry so decided to order a la carte, and got 2 appetizers and the roasted chicken designed to share between 2. The starters were so creative - lasagna style pasta with mushrooms and the ragout of early summer vegetables. The pasta was very unique, made with coffee instead of water for additional flavor in a delicious meat sauce that we mopped up with bread. The ragout was basically a medley of fresh veggies mixed with fresh flower petals, razor clams, ham, topped with a half cooked farm fresh egg in a foam sauce. Very refreshing and different from what you would see anywhere else.\n\nThe main entree took ~35 minutes to prepare in the oven, but when they brought it out it all made sense. I'm not a huge fan of meat, but this whole roasted chicken for two was PERFECTLY cooked. Even the chicken breast meat became tender, melt-in-your mouth morsels. The creamy gravy sauce had mushrooms and apricot mixed in, making a very interesting but delicious complement to the meat. This chicken could have fed a family of four. I also love that they bring the whole roasted chicken out for your inspection, and then bring it back to carve it all up for you so you can just enjoy the meat. They also plate it with the mushrooms and the gravy so you get the fullness of flavor in every bite. Highly recommend this dish!\n\nOverall fantastic dining experience. I haven't experienced such innovative twists on food in a while, and I am so glad we ate here. Do not miss a chance to visit if you are in Boston!"]
["NOTE: this review is only for the 6 course tasting menu!\n\nI've heard such amazing things about COM, but for some reason, I wasn't terribly impressed. We got the 6 course tasting menu, and lemme tell you, it's a decent amount of food.. I've had tasting menus where I've left hungry, and I've had tasting menus where I nearly had to unbutton just to breath.. but here they gave the perfect amount. The restaurant itself is nice, the staff is very professional, BUT unfortunately, even though each dish was carefully planned and executed, I wasn't impressed with any of the dishes.\n\nIf it was my first tasting menu, perhaps I'd think it was phenomenal, but compared to others I've had in NYC, I was a little underwhelmed.\n\nThat being said, I still wanna give COM another shot... perhaps next time I come I'll order a la carte? And I hear their burger is one of the best...."]
['I\'ve now been to Craigie twice in the last month, doing the tasting menu both times. The first time it was spectacular, tiny bites of incredibly delicious food. A very solid five-star experience and in contention for a spot on my list of all time great restaurants. \n\nThe second visit was a serious letdown. The food was still good, but nothing like $175/person good, which is where our bill ended up. Only two of the courses really popped as eating something special. Unfortunately I can\'t recount the dishes in detail as I couldn\'t really hear the waitpersons over the music and other noise. Two of our courses were cod, the first , a small square of fish on a  bed of beans was fabulous. The second, larger pieces still on the bones was only OK. The dessert was also seriously good, a chocolate confection with, I think, white chocolate ice cream. Really good. None of the rest of the dishes were memorable, and one, a pasta in a brown sauce with turnips was just bad. I\'d had a very similar dish on my prior visit that I could also have done without. The pasta was grainy, with an unpleasant texture, and the sauce was "earthy" like in it tasted like dirt. I don\'t mind a miss every now and again, but I\'m not sure why they didn\'t scratch this one after the first night. The pork cooked several different ways was hit and miss. One of the preparations, a small pillow-shaped something that was fried was wonderful. The pork belly was just undercooked pork fat. Why bother? The sausage was OK, but not great, and the rib was overcooked and oddly (over?)spiced. \n\nService was great the first night, attentive and timely and well-paced, the second night the meal seemed to take forever (we were there for over four hours, over an hour longer than the first time); the time between some of the courses seemed endless. My guests were clearly impatient with it. \n\nI will probably try it again because the first visit was so incredibly good--perhaps the burger is the way to go. At that price level though I really hope for a more consistent performance. I really have to wonder if these two meals were cooked by the same people, as there was no comparison between the two nights experiences.\n\nEdited because I decided two stars was too harsh.']
["I was under whelmed. Ambiance and servers was nice. For the price, I'm expecting much more. Place is expensive (20 starters, 40 entrees). We started with octopus, clams and salad. Only the octopus was worth it. My main was a poorly cooked local swordfish. Very regrettable. Upside was they brought a lot of dessert to make up for the bad meal. I wasnt thrilled with the experience and won't be back."]
["We returned to Craigie a couple weeks ago, and I am happy to say it has gained a star! Our last visit was great. My date had the grass-fed steak, and I had the pork three ways. My meal was absolutely amazing. We also had the fried clams as an appetizer, which were good, but I don't love clams (this was mainly for my date). \n\nFinally, we ordered the praline nougat for dessert - while it was interesting, the nougat was quite tough, lending itself to a bit of an awkward dessert to share, so I'm not sure I would recommend that if you're sharing. We had great wine, recommended by the waitress, and prosecco. Great service again."]
['I know, I know, Craigie on Main has won all kinds of awards, and the rating here on Yelp is at or very near the top of the chart.  But when your 3 course Prix Fixe runs around $65/person, and the wine list lists far more 3 digit wines than two digit wines, you better nail it on all fronts.  Craigie on Main had too many misses.  But first, give credit where credit is due:\n\n1. If it isn\'t on the menu, try to special order the bone marrow.  This was Olympian bone marrow.  Yes, you will gain several pounds.  Yes, your cholesterol levels will skyrocket.  It is worth it.  An order comes with 3 bones, you really only need one bone per person unless someone plans to make a meal out of it.  You don\'t need one of those little marrow spoons, you need a marrow tablespoon.  Just do it.\n\n2. Food preparation was generally excellent, and there was an extremely wide range of ingredients, textures, and tastes to orchestrate.  The kitchen was, to use rock and roll band terms, tight.\n\n3. Want a food adventure?  You have found your wild ride.  You will have the opportunity to eat things you may have never eaten, or eat things you have eaten before but concocted in a unique fashion.  With Craigie on Main you will experience a crazy culinary roller coaster.\n\nBut...\n\n1.  That roller coaster tipped over the rails several times.  Just a few examples:  (a) Chocolate plus Mexican spice continues to be in vogue, and twice that combination was delivered.  The idea here is to provide just barely enough heat and flavor offset from the Mexican side of the border to draw out nuances in the chocolate.  The Mexican flavors and heat here destroyed the chocolate, making the dishes inedible.  (b) Similarly, one of the sorbets was so tart, it utterly numbed the palette.   (c) A coquillage of generally yummy bits of several shellfish broke down into a cacophony of flavors and textures - and some of the bits were cooked to rubber; too much all at once.\n\nOne could chalk up these missteps to the desire to take the diner on that great culinary adventure though, and many of our other dishes were excellent.  One or two dishes, beside the bone marrow, were even transcendent, however:\n\n2. Bottle of red wine served too warm, north of 70 degrees.   At your local pub, okay, forgiven, but not here and not at these prices.\n\n3. Glass of wine delivered by the server who swirled the glass furiously before putting it down on the table, and he stopped only when requested, and he protested that request.  Hey, if I want to swirl my wine to open it up I will, but this swirling over-fascination was an intrusion, a presumption, and unacceptable.\n\n4. Service either overwhelmed or was non-existent.  There was a 15 minute window where we saw nobody, with all our dirty plates stacked up in front of us.  But then there was a rush, you could barely sip your water without it getting refilled.  Service was, being nice here, rough around the edges.\n\n5. We were not once, but twice, by different servers, hard sold the tasting menu.  Did they steal these servers from the lot stalkers of Boch Toyota or Muzi Ford?  In both cases when it was clear that we were not biting they kept going on.  Funny how they could take several minutes to blast us with tasting menu pitch, but couldn\'t get us first glass of wine/cocktails within 15 minutes of ordering.\n\nFinally, I asked 3 different servers to turn down the rock music coming out of the speaker right over my head.  Eventually, using hand signals with a sharp bus person, the music got turned down - about 30 minutes into the seating.  If I want to listen to acid rock or Fleetwood Mac at volume, I will do that in the privacy of my own home or vehicle, thank you.  I couldn\'t hear the people across the table from me.  The response to my first request should have been, "Of course, right away!" with the execution nearly immediate, either that or they should have offered us the option to be reseated not so close to the ceiling speaker.\n\nAll in, Craigie on Main ran us nearly $150/each, and we did not tip @ 20%, it wasn\'t deserved. Funny thing, when Craigie was on Craigie, the service was excellent, and the kitchen, while still adventurous, produced more integrated, thoughtful, subtle, flawless food.  Feel free to buy into the hype, into the Cambridge coolness, but at half the price I will take the Ten Tables that now inhabits the original Craigie on Craigie half basement.\n\nThe bone marrow, alone though, almost made it worth it.']
['We did our third Chef\'s Whim last night at Craigie - it was spectacular and delicious as usual. From the start the service is excellent - they bring fresh bread rolls, soft whipped butter and a bowl of green marinated olives. We started off with a swordfish pastrami with pork belly as an amuse bouche, followed by foie gras torchon with date puree, pistachios and brioche. Our third course was a fish filet with clams and a delicious beurre blanc sauce, and the largest "entree" course was grass-fed sliced beef with charred eggplant and cherry tomatoes. Each course was perfectly cooked with a unique blend of flavors and textures. We brought our friends as a belated wedding gift and we are certain to return. Next time for that amazing burger...']
["The food was decent, service and presentation were good, and it was incredibly overpriced. The brunch entrees start at $17. I got the burger--it was decent, but not worth $17. It was also the greasiest burger I've ever eaten. Decent food, but not that special."]
['For the Restaurant Week period, I found out that while Craigie on Main was not participating in RW, they were offering an expanded version of their $39.95 Neighborhood Menu - three courses, three choices per course.  What a great opportunity to try out this special occassion (for me anyhow) spot!\n\nThe afternoon before our scheduled visit, I received a call to confirm the reservation.  As a pleasant surprise, I was offered 2 of the 4 seats at the Chef\'s Table, overlooking the open kitchen.  Sure!  Thank you!\n\nNow, I say, if you get the chance, go!  Sit at the Chef\'s Table, and enjoy!  I felt like I was enjoying front row seats of my very own Kitchen Stadium!  "Yes, Chef!" "Runners, please!" "Toast for bones, hurry!"  \n\nOh, and I watched them dissect half a pig\'s face... so if you are against the consumption and cruelty of animals, consider that before you ask to be seated at the Chef\'s Table.\n\nWe were a bit early for our reservation, so we were initially guided towards the bar side to wait a bit.  Bar seats themselves seem a precious commodity, as a couple that wished to fill a pair of just emptied seats were discouraged.  Perhaps they were reserved?  Later on, we did watch as a number of wonderful looking hamburgers with a mountain of shoe string fries headed that a way during our dinner.\n\nThe staff here seemed rather sizeable, as I witnessed a number of servers darting here and there, popping out wine corks, serving dishes.  The kitchen staff themselves numbered perhaps 9, minus the dishwasher I spotted through a swinging door.\n\nServing us alone were a multitude working together to take our order, provide us with fresh silverware with each course, wipe away our crumbs, and deliver our numerous courses.  Not that we ordered one of the grand tastings... no, we selected the "Neighborhood" 3 course prix fixe for $39.95.  Oh, and a side of bone marrow for $10.  But we also received a number of complimentary small tastings throughout our evening.\n\nSometimes we received the same items, such as the blood sausage spread on crostini (interesting) and the rhubarb hibiscus foam, while other times they were different, like the salmon pate(?) and the eggplant something or other, and the samplings of sorbet (peach for one and plum for the other).\n\nCorn must be in season as I\'ve been spotting corn soup in various forms on several recent menus.  But I\'m always up for a good one, so for my appetizer I selected the Potage of Local Butter and Sugar Corn $16 over the other choice of mussels.  It was a pureed soup served hot with a nice corn flavor.\n\nBoth proteins in the entrees (Red Quinoa-Crusted Arctic Char Mi-Cuit Wellfleet and manila clams, cockles, roasted cherry tomatoes, pistou-dashi broth $30 and Onion-Smothered Vermont All-Natural Chicken Two Ways: Slow Roasted Breast, Crispy Thigh Confit three bean ragout, tatsoi, natural jus $26) were cooked perfectly, leaving the meat moist and tender.\n\nThe bone marrow we had elected to have with our entrees.  The single large bone sliced in two and two pieces of toast sliced in triangles were plenty for the two of us.  If you\'ve never had marrow before, think of it as fat, or rich buttery spread.  Dig some out of the center gooey stuff out of the bone half and slather it on to the toast point, sprinkle it with sea salt and go ahead and take a bite!\n\nWhat I imagined to be a simple panna cotta turned out to be Sour Milk Panna Cotta with banana puree, dried milk and some kind of nut.  I was curious to see if I could find a contender to match my top (and now idealized) panna cotta experience at Icarus (RIP), and Craigie On Maine did very well indeed!  It was tasty and smooth and melty good compared to Icarus\' which started out with a body and melted on your tongue.  Ahhhhh!\n\nI accidentally forgot my leftover chicken when we left.  But before we even turned the corner, one of our servers ran out after us with the brown paper bag in hand.\n\nThe only thing I tasted that night that I would not care a repeat of is the rhubarb hibiscus foam, which was not to my personal enjoyment, and left a odd feel on my tongue.  Fortunately though, my final taste of the night was the chocolate almond cluster.\n\nBefore we left, I made the suggestion that they add purse hooks for the ladies at the high topped Chef\'s Table, after all, hanging your purse on the chair behind you in such a busy area isn\'t such a grand idea.']
['I had very high expectations for Craigie On Main given the high Yelp reviews. Unfortunately, the dining experience did not fully meet my expectation on two counts: food and service. \n\nFOOD: My table went with the three-course menu. As a vegetarian, there were very few options to choose from. While the waitress said that they could be accommodating, I found that my pasta appetizer\'s flavors were slightly off and that the pasta texture was a little bit too chewy. My main entree--a collection of vegetables--were pretty bland. And the dessert was a bit too exotic for my taste, with the dessert wine pairings a little bit spicy? Maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough, but I felt that the food was "trying too hard" (if such a thing exists).\n\nSERVICE: The service was definitely off-putting. Our waitress spent at least 10 minutes trying to convince us that we should go with the chef\'s tasting menu.... seriously? 10 minutes? It didn\'t feel genuine, but felt that the waitress was just looking to bring in more money for the restaurant. \n\nOverall, the venue is classy, the food is decent, the service is fast enough, but I think there are nicer restaurants that you can opt for in the Boston area!']
["Have been meaning to come here for a long time and finally made my way over when a friend suggested we go get 1 of the 18 burgers they make each night.\n\nWe go, we order, we eat... in conclusion it is 1 of the Top 3 burgers I've ever had!!  (one being my own and the other being a restaurant in DTX).\n\nEverything is fresh and/or made in-house.  The house-made bun was delicious and perfectly toasted, the mace ketchup is made in-house, the burger itself has suet, bone marrow and dehydrated miso mixed in it.  This guy created a GREAT BURGER!! Worth every penny! And you should definitely add the bacon because... it's BACON!\n\nSkip the egg, and just focus on delicious meat!\n\nAnd after you enjoy that burger, you know there's a little bit of room for some dessert in there.  I'll make it easy for you... go for the Praline-Nougat dessert, you will not be disappointed!\n\nWill definitely be back to try the rest of their culinary genius as well as repeat trips for the burger!"]
["Casual cozy dining but has looks like plenty of seating - and full on a Thursday night\n\nWent with the 6 course tasting menu which changes daily\nLoved the progression (Seafood to dessert)\nAll beautifully presented and delicious with one major miss - the pork belly - too hard to chew, I couldn't finish it which was a shame"]
['If you are looking for a charming location for your next special dinner, consider Craigie on Main, relocated to this cozy setting near the MIT Museum.  A lovely dining room and the chance to observe a legion of chefs at work in the open-plan kitchen will greet you.  \n\nIf however you are looking for a welcoming experience, memorable food, and reasonable prices, keep looking.  Craigie on Main "knows what\'s best" and you had better do what they say.  Wait patiently. It may be 6 degrees outside; still they will not open their door, even to the vestibule, until 5.30pm.  Order the burger.  You will be told at the front desk that there are only 18 burgers available on any night so put in your order before you are seated. (Sort of a cool early decision plan for food rather than college admission. ) Do as you are told.  The "burger" does not appear on their menu--if it did, I suppose it would be under the category Manufactured Scarcity--so you will have no idea what you\'re signing up for or the cost. You will be scorned as a novice if you don\'t add the requisite fried egg and bacon.  But be grateful for small flavors. The amuse bouche is either a rice cracker with "trois gras"--I swear that\'s what they said (I asked twice to be sure that was trois not fois)--or a sardine pave the size of half a postage stamp.  Remember they know best. The oysters will arrive with the chef\'s choice of sauce already added to each crustacean.  The fried clams will huddle on one side of an otherwise empty plate...looking rather like something that might accompany a ransom note to underline the dire nature of the demands. And do order that rare and famous burger... which turns out to be a cheeseburger. Consistently described as "a burger" and with no written description provided ("it\'s not on our menu"), there was no escape from the cheese. You\'re lactose intolerant?  Too bad; we know better what you should eat.  \n\nMore surprises: the "it comes with bacon and a fried egg" is actually a supplement billed at $3 per item.  The meat is ground in-house, proven by the inclusion of miniscule bone chips.   There was a lot of laying and taking away of silverware but we still had to wait for appetizer forks and salt.  We were given a "time when we will need the table back."  When our server brought dessert menus, and we explained we were on the clock, she appealed the deadline--to no avail.  So wait patiently, do as you\'re told, leave when they say...but do enjoy the space, the exclusive burger, and their superior sense of what you ought to have ....and you will (or let\'s say we did) take all this attitude and instruction and pay $150.00 (tip not included) for 2 appetizers, 2 glasses of wine, and 3 burgers. As we drifted happily out the door, the manager was instructing a server "And if they just showed up then, well, the answer is "No."  That\'s my answer to Craigie on Main as well.']
["Everything about this place is wonderful. The food was all excellent with such  interesting and creative desserts! \nI had such a hard time choosing between all the options so my friend and I each ordered from the prix fixe menu and shared everything. Most places would have given us a hard time about sharing, but the staff made it effortless. For such a relatively small space, I was expecting noise to be an issue but I never even noticed there were other people around. Loved everything!\nOnly thing I would have liked better is for the bread to be served warm, but that's just my personal preference."]
["I went into Craigie on Main prepared to love it. Not only was it my goodbye-for-now dinner with Josephine L, it was one of her favorite restaurants. And considering the height of her standards combined with her breadth of food-savvy, I was predestined to click with Craigie as instantaneously as I clicked with her.  As it turns out, my attempt to love Craigie bore a much closer resemblance to my attempt to love swimming. I tried all the strokes, and I tried the 6-course chef's whims with the same enthusiasm, but I left not completely impressed and feeling like I wanted to swim with fins.\n\nSome highlights from my chef's whims:\nThe Tuna Sashimi was amazingly fresh, and the toasted garlic topper made it absolutely exceptional.\nThe Potato and Green Onion Vichyssoise with oxtail pastrami is as green as sea glass, and the light, crisp green onion evenly balances the rich, heavy potato perfectly. I love skillfully-made soups, and this one is no exception.\nThe venison sausage, suckling pig confit, and grilled pork belly with cherry coulis was amazing. The sausage was a bit too rich and salty, but the gamey flavor of venison is always welcome on any plate of mine. Grilled pork belly is guaranteed to be fantastic as long as it's not cooked grievously poorly, but this one was perfectly seared. The fatty sweet-meats of the confit and belly fit my definition of umami to a tee.\n\nMy one huge issue was that the they had the nerve to charge the Strawberry Sorbet palate cleanser, a one-inch ball of sorbet, as a full course. When we complained, the manager handled it quickly and politely, thus the only deductions earned were applied to our check and not to my star rating of Craigie. The service here is the stuff of legends.\n\nDessert did end our tasting on a high note as my Coconut Sorbet with pumpernickel, bing cherries, and chocolate crumbs was simultaneously rich and refreshing and Josephine's Apricot Frangipane Torte was yet another tasty conclusion.\n\nSadly, all good things must come to an end, and I tearfully bid Craigie a premature, untimely goodbye, much like the one I bid Josephine at the conclusion of our meal. I will see Josephine again and I hope it will be soon, but I'm not sure I'll see Craigie again, even in the remote future."]
["I really enjoy this place. On a student budget though, the prices are a lot to swallow. I've found a workaround for that. While the burger is not on the dinner menu, if you ask, they will serve it. And wow is it good. Juicy, high quality meat cooked to perfection. I've also had brunch here and left very happy. \n\nMake a reservation! I tried to make one three months in advance for graduation in May without luck. Too bad."]
["Three words: to. die. for. \n\nWelcome to foodie paradise. Quaint and cozy, it felt like dining at a lifelong friend's home. No-fuss service. [Melanie YOU rock]. The wine offerings are impeccable--sorry friends, you will not find any American staples or boxed Franzia here. \n\nChef's whim tasting (six or eight course) is definitely recommended.  It changes daily, and yes, there is a vegetarian option! Locally sourced, freshest ingredients, and a chef's sophisticated palate take you on a truly unique culinary journey. The experience and melt-in-your-mouth dishes are worth every dollar.\n\np.s. you'll want to give yourself at least 2.5 hours."]
["I had the privilege of dining here this past Monday night. Even though I was dining by myself the staff was incredibly attentive and very friendly. My server Monica was extremely knowledgeable and a complete pro. If you're adventurous enough, get the tasting menu! Every dish was spot on and delicious, one amazing dish after the next in a well thought out progression. Much thanks to the entire staff for making a solo dinner a complete win. I'll be back as soon as possible!"]
["10-course tasting menu. A-M-A-Z-I-N-G. One of the best tasting menus I have ever tasted. Omg. \n\nYou get to put in requests for what you want to see on your tasting menu. Or else it's entirely up to the chef's mood for the day. But it would usually involve some seafood trio, more seafood dishes, and a protein (the server mentioned it's often beef bone marrow or lamb). We requested pork belly to be included per other yelper's recommendation. \n\nI WAS SO HAPPY. \n\nMy favorite things:\n- squid noodle (sounds weird, right? tastes amazing though)\n- lamb 3 ways (the chef came out to explain the dish!)\n- kama (fish head. correction. GIANT fish head :) my fav)\n- scallop sashimi\n- epi baguette bread!\n- champagne foam on the sorbet\n\nsidenote: apparently if you are douchey enough, you can get a discount. The table next to us complained about the price after they had completed the entire meal (! with multiple courses!) and the floor manager came and offered them a free meal for the next one. If only they would award the good-behaving people like us! Alas, we were way too happy with the meal to even attempt to fake disgruntled-ness to schwing for discounts. \n\nDownside: distilled water was $7! why?"]
['A friend and I went there because we heard the burger was really good.  We planned on getting there right after work at 5:30pm.  We got there at 5:25pm.  Why is that important?  Because they keep the door locked until 5:30pm exactly.  It was about 15 degrees outside with some wind so standing there waiting for them to unlock the door kinda sucked.\n\nWe got in and took our seats at the bar - we had heard they don\'t serve the burger anywhere but at the bar.  We ordered drinks - beer for me and mixed drink for my friend.  The beer was one I had never had before (I\'m not a "Bud" type beer drinker.  Frankly, that\'s not a beer.) and it was pretty good.  My friend\'s mixed drink was great and we inquired with the bartender what they put in her drink as it had a different flavor than she was used to.\n\nBurgers were really good but not great.  I wouldn\'t go there for a burger again basically because of the cost.  I know a few places where I can get a really good burger for about half the price.  The fries were really good as well.  \n\nThe staff was great - very friendly and customer focused - except for not opening up 5 minutes early when there were 5 people waiting outside in freezing weather to get in.\n\nI want to go back and try their regular menu.  Based on the burger, I\'m sure the other selections are just as tasty.  I\'ll just make sure to have a reservation that\'s later than 5:30pm.\n\nThis looks like a great date night restaurant.']
["Updating my review after receiving a lengthy apology and reply from one of the managers. Their message was sent soon after my review but I don't check my Yelp inbox often :) \n\nThe manager was apologetic and went through each of my complaints to try to address them. I stand by the service being stand-offish but the food being great. Unfortunately I have moved out of Cambridge temporarily but I hope to give Craigie another try sometime in the future. Bumping the review to 2 stars until I'm able to visit in person."]
['Every time, really delicious - all that really needs to be said.\n\nFriends took us to the chef\'s "whim" on Sunday night - not only is it fun it is delicious. The dessert was especially to die for.']
["wow wow wow\n\nSo I had been dying to eat here since it opened but never got around to it until last week and it did not disappoint!\n\nI am not a huge meat eater but am fascinated by the nose to tail ideal and although  I wasn't brave enough, this time, to order the crispy pig tails or pig head for two, I did enjoy some bone marrow! \n\nWe also had oyster soup (can't recall the fancy name)and foie gras to start- beautiful plating and amazing flavors.\n\nFor dinner I had the chicken sausage stuffed chicken which was good but next time I might be more adventurous. My wife had the pork 3 ways and loved it!\n\nI finished with a fruit pana cotta- refreshing and delicious. My wife had the chocolate fernet with tarragon ice cream which she devoured.\n\nUsually places with a lot of hype fall short in my experience but not Craigie on Main. I'd only advise that this isn't the place for vegetarians!"]
['The most pleasurable solo dining experience I have enjoyed in recent memory.  I lucked into a seat at the bar on a busy Friday night, and decided to enjoy some dinner.  Of course the food was fantastic, but what bears mention is the extremely high service standards upheld by the bar staff.  \n\nDuring the time of my visit, the bartenders were extremely busy making cocktails and keeping the restaurant\'s servers supplied with whatever they needed.  Despite this work load, "my" bartender was able to greet me and make me feel welcome, answer questions about the menu, make recommendations about wine, and in general insure my experience was of quality.  \n\nIt is highly unusual, and extremely pleasurable to experience such a high service standard in a busy bar environment.  Kudos to COM staff and management for exhibiting this level of excellence.']
['No better place to eat in Cambridge than Craigie on Main. Everything exceeded our expectations, which were high from past visits. The wine list is fun. Service was solicitous without being obsequious. Unfortunate that the pig face was unavailable even though I called the week before. We will try again.']
['I want to love Craigie, I really do, but after three meals there and only one that I\'d actually recommend, I\'m finding it hard to.\n\nMy most recent disappointment involved dinner at the bar. My mother and I showed up early to snag a seat and try the famous Craigie burger, and things started promisingly enough. Our slightly aloof (perhaps too cool for school?) bartender had a deft hand with spirits and crafted us two delicious cocktails. Craigie being known for all things pork, we decided to go with the crispy fried pig\'s tails for an appetizer, and a rabbit hash with fall vegetables for good measure. The pig\'s tails were definitely a highlight (if a little difficult to eat), but the hash was bland and unmemorable.\n\nOnto the main course, my mom decided to skip the burger and try the cod. It was a wonderful piece of fish and beautifully prepared, but absurdly overpriced at $38. At $19 (plus $3 for bacon), my burger seemed like a steal...until I tried it, that is. Words cannot express my disappointment. I have heard the term "umami" thrown around to extol the virtues of Craigie\'s burger, but mine was (dare I say) bland. Not only that, it was medium rare bordering on rare, and falling apart. I honestly should have sent it back, but my mother and I have had to do that before at Craigie, and I was afraid our picture might end up on the wall.\n\nAt this point, I think I\'d only ever return to Craigie if it were on someone else\'s dime. I still have fond memories of the Chef\'s Whim tasting, but they\'re fading fast.']
["The following statements may have been made during our epic eating endurance test named Craigie on Main's pig head:\n\nMe: We're ingesting roughly the equivalent of the total caloric consumption of a Tanzanian village for a month...\n\nB: Can I bring home the bacon?\nMe: I can't handle any more meat.\n\nMe: I think I'm done. I can't finish another bite.\nB: You're going to let a pig's head defeat us?!\nMe: Okay... one more bite. That's it.\n\n----\n\nI'd been reading about Craigie on Main for ages on Cocktail Virgin Slut's blog and had been meaning to try out their drinks for months. The boy was thoughtful enough to snag us a booking for Christmas Eve, after I landed on an inbound flight from Chicago. \n\nAs fortune would have it, some poor schmucks had to cancel their chef's table reservation, so we lucked into getting the best seats in the house - right at the kitchen counter, overlooking all the dishes being plated and sent off to their destinations!\n\nNot only were the servers extremely professional and generally efficient (sans one minor incident where a drink order got mysteriously held up), they were also a wealth of knowledge about cocktail lore as well. Not just one of them. -All- of them. Not dissimilar to Blue Duck Tavern in DC, it appears that while we had a primary server, the setup is much like team service, where anyone is happy to help you with putting in an order or bringing you whatever you need. Quite grand, really.\n\nAnd beyond luscious libations (have the bartenders craft you something!), Craigie on Main's cuisine is beyond reproach (if you don't mind a touch more salt than necessary). We opted for a ever-so-slightly more conservative $65 a head three-course menu rather than either of the chef's tasting menus, as we wanted a bit more control over our choices and a possibly less food. We failed.\n\nThe Spanish octopus starter was delightfully tender and flavourful, however the bone marrow 'small' course was absolutely massive. Two huge... I don't even know what they were... femurs?... came with some huge slices of bread and a small pinch-bowl of salt. Absurdity. Delicious, fatty absurdity.\n\nAnd although our server warned us the pig's head would take about an hour to arrive, it was definitely to our table within thirty minutes of putting in our order. And it was epic. Served much like the mu shu pork I grew up with (don't judge, I was an Americanised Chinese kid), you're ostensibly meant to slather some house-made hoisin sauce on their pancakes, toss on some posh slaw, and nom away on the fatty, crispy, succulent meat. I loved that upon delivery of the dish, the only instructions provided were these: everything on the pig's head can be eaten, including the eyeball; get messy. So we did.\n\nAnd whilst the desserts were a great way to polish off a meal (along with a glass of Fernet, of course), they were utterly unnecessary. We were barely able to finish off 90% of the pig's head, let alone anything else. The trio of sorbets were great for cleansing palates, though.\n\nBuck for buck, I'd argue that Hungry Mother is a better deal, however there's a lot to be said about paying for dinner and a show - at least at the chef's table. Though you'll be shelling out for it, our dinner at Craigie on Main was virtually flawless. It's well worthwhile for a 'do before you leave Boston' kind of experience."]
['Has anyone ever asked you "What would you eat if you had to pick your last dinner?" Well I would probably just head back here for their 8 course meal again. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday after my friend recommended it to us. It was the perfect choice! We did the 8 course meal where everything they bring you is a surprise and made fresh. The food was exquisite! We literally enjoyed everything that was put in front of us. You aren\'t just paying for food here but for an experience as well. The service was impeccable. I have eaten many nice meals at restaurants all over the world but this one really stands out. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves food, you won\'t leave disappointed.']
['Had a tremendous time here last night with another couple. Parking is available by valet or in a nearby municipal lot. Cocktails are delicious though expensive. We had the three course prix fixe menu. Everything was terrific. I had the pasta with seafood (which was unique and flavorful) and my wife had the ragout. We also had the oysters which were spectacular - fresh and delicious and icy cold.  We had the chicken which was amazingly juicy with a great sauce and the hake (perfectly cooked). Service was also top notch. Only minor disappointment was dessert- the poached pear was good but slightly over cooked.']
['Headquartered only a couple of blocks away, I end up here a lot. For a drink, for a snack, for a dinner... My friends always look at me incredulously and say things like "woah, fancy!" And I go ahead and let them think I\'m baller. The truth is when it comes to snacks, cocktails, and bar meals, Craigie is pretty competitively priced with all of the other eateries in the area. I\'m spending no more here than I do at any local restaurant. Eating at the full restaurant is a different story-- what do you think I am, a Medici? A Rockefeller? \n\nI come here during snowstorms because it\'s empty and they serve hot buttered rum. I come here when I want an absinthe done right. I come here when I want to eat crispy pig tails (which, by the way,taste like large tender chunks of bacon and are delicious). I come here when I don\'t mind spending $20 on what has been called the best burger on the east coast (okay, fine, in that situation I really am baller). \n\nThe bartenders exude libation badassery, and the service overall is classy enough to make you temporarily forget that you live just above the poverty line and still owe five figures loans for your graduate degree. For just a few minutes, you get to pensively stare at the condensation on your perfectly-crafted drink, suddenly look up, and think things like, "I should buy a boat."']
["Expectations met! An amazing dining experience, from beginning to end. The ambience was casual yet elegant, whether you're joined with friend(s) or that special someone. We sat at a quiet corner booth as requested. The service was impeccable, servers were polite and knowledgeable, each menu item were well explained when asked.\n\nThe food was excellent! I started with the Spanish octopus and bone marrow. The Spanish octopus was accompanied with grilled cipollini onion, green olive and lemon salad, bulgur wheat, chorizo purée. The octopus was smoky, tender, sweet, and cooked perfectly. The bone marrow, well what can I say, it was smoky, gelatinous melt in your mouth goodness. My friend had the Assiette of House-Made Terrines, pork liver terrine, rabbit terrine, venison terrine, with traditional accompaniments. Each was amazingly flavorful.\n\nFor my entree, I had the Vermont Pork Three Ways, Suckling Confit, Spice Crusted Rib, Grilled Belly, with pistachio butter, turnips, pickled cherries. OMG! The rib was perfectly spiced, so tender, melted in my mouth. The grilled pork belly was like butter, the sensation on the tongue and taste buds was indescribable. The confit, the crispy skin on top was crunchy and salty (Hallelujah!), followed by a yummy adipose layer, then ending with a delicate layer of tasty confit. So so GREAT!\n\nMy friend had the Slow-Cooked Wild California King Salmon Mi-Cuit\nfresh rock shrimp, summer succotash, Vadouvan-spiced yogurt. Delicious!"]
['I went to Craigie for the Sunday night Chef\'s Whim tasting so this review should be read with a grain of salt given that I did not have a "typical" experience or access to the regular menu.\n\nWith that said, I thought the meal was absolutely delicious. I had the vegetarian whim menu. Started a cute amuse bouche, followed by an heirloom tomato and blue cheese salad that was delicious and right on with what was seasonal at the time. \n\nNext up was roasted peaches with savory seasoning that was so creative and absolutely delicious. The "main" course was a creative summer squash and veggie dish that was very well done. Dessert was a buttermilk panna cotta that was amazing, creamy but light and flavorful.\n\nOur service was excellent, if maybe a little too attentive, we technically had one main waitress, but were also frequently waited on by two other and very attentive servers, so it got a bit confusing when ordering wine refills, but that\'s really nit-picky and it wasn\'t problematic.\n\nMy main complain with my meal at Craigie, and the reason I did not give 5 stars, is that I left hungry. The vegetarian tasting menu was 3 small courses of almost entirely fruit and veggies, nothing very hearty or satisfying, and I am a girl with a pretty normal (read not insatiable) appetite. I ended up trying to stuff myself with bread, which was disappointing given how much I paid for the meal (which was a LOT).']
["Came here for a birthday dinner during the week - we tried the 6 course tasting menu plus the pig's tails.  \n\nPros:\nThe space was really nice - relaxed and casual but you still knew you were in a nicer restaurant.\n\nThe service was good - not great.\n\nThe bathrooms were nice.\n\nCons:\nThere were definitely ups and downs with the menu - some dishes were really good - some were terrible and many were very salty.  Overall I think the fish dishes were better than anything else (veg or meat dishes) and the only dessert we liked was the apple fritters.  I found the pig's tails very fatty - and tasted like fatty chicken wings - but other people in my party really liked them.\n\nBy the time we were finished with the meal and a bottle of wine it was about $200/each which I think is too much for a good but not amazing meal.\n\n\n\n\nI would like to go back and check out the bar menu or maybe try the regular menu - however if one person wants the tasting menu everyone has to order."]
["I am so glad I finally had the chance to eat at this wonderful place! The bf and I settled in at a bar seat this Sunday early afternoon and enjoyed the burger, and the beef tongue hash.\n\nBoth were exceptional, although I have to say I think my burger beat out the hash. I ordered suggested medium rare temp, and it did come out closer to the rare side, but I had no qualms in devouring it anyway. I got it sans bun since I'm GF, but with the depth of flavor, I'm kind of glad I got to focus just on the beef. \n\nThe burger comes with a side of ketchup, (what I am assuming were housemade) pickles, small bite of coleslaw, and small lightly dressed greens salad. The coleslaw was underwhelming, but really didn't detract.\n\nBesides the burger, the other star was the Civilian Cocktail, a mezcal libation. The bf had the bloody mary and I found it to be just OK. I'd aim for a craft cocktail next time."]
["Do you call yourself a burger lover? If so, you need to get your burger-loving ass over to Craigie on Main and treat yourself to what is arguably the most decadent and delicious burger in Boston (Cambridge).\n\nWe got here around 5:45 on a Thurs night and snagged a couple of seats at the bar before that area filled completely up. After mentioning that we wanted to try the highly praised burger, the bartender surprisingly suggested an alvarinho, which paired quite well with the rich meal. \n\nThe burger didn't disappoint- the meat was incredibly tender, cooked perfectly to a juicy medium rare, topped with housemade ketchup, lettuce, onions on a homemade bun. I wish that there was something on the burger that gave it a different textural element (maybe a crisp pickle or thicker/chunkier cut onions), because the bun got squishy and saturated with burger meat juices. Not a terrible thing, but I think I would've enjoyed it just a bit more if there was a contrasting texture served on the burger.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah, this burger did cost $19, and yes, it was SO WORTH IT."]
['I have to update with another five star rating.  Went in on Christmas Eve Eve.  My fiance and I ordered the six course tasting and I asked if we could do wine pairings.  The waiter informed us that not only would the chef personalize a menu for us, but there was no such thing as "wine pairings" because he would put together a personalized wine list.  The waiter even let us split glasses of wine and half glasses of wine to make the bill a little less of a blow to the wallet.  It also allowed us to have a couple glasses of wine instead of 6 whole glasses.  The waiter asked us what kind of food we liked, if we had any allergies and how adventurous we were with food.  He also asked us if we had any wine preferences.\n\nThe food was great, yet again, but this time the service completely blew me away.']
['Proprietor/Chef: Tony Maws\n\nSTELLAR!! one of the rare reviews i\'ve seen that merits all 5 stars and actually spot on.  i give it my high five.  \n\na gf and i originally was planning on going to cuchi cuchi instead.  the hostess with her fancy red lipstick and avant garde look, much like the rest of the restaurant and its decor.  its presence is to be seen and to be remembered.  something unforgettable that\'s for sure.  as much as i was looking forward to eating here, 45-60 minute wait was unacceptable.  especially considering my last real meal was 7 hours ago.  glucose levels decreasing by the minute.  NO CAN DO!!!\n\nwe rolled through next door to craigie (not an easy name to remember btw)...without reservations at the main table (next time slot avail. @ 10pm) we gladly seated ourselves at the bar.  what the hell, i have more fun sitting at the bar anyways, as past references will tell.  \n\nthe one thing i didn\'t like about sitting at the bar was my view away from the open, visible kitchen.  I was in love with the set up.  everything prepped, cleaned, cook right in front of your very eyes.  Transparent as day &amp; night.  Clearly, my level of trust on the food here was in their hands now...\n\ni decided to go with the mussels when a couple adjacent to the corner of us, had their monstrosity of a burger come out.... the husband saw my dimly light eyes bright up... and said "she\'s been thinking about this burger all day...since 2pm".  better than sex i thought?  i so desperately wanted to find out. i quickly chased down the bartender who kindly enough was able to change my order just in the nick of time. \n\nLocal Grass-Fed Burger - stuffed with cheese, house made sesame bun, mace ketchup, home made celery root slaw and pickles and the thinnest shoe string fries ever made on earth.  tasted straight like potato stix from the can, plus the chives, garlic and cayenne pepper that it was topped with.  amazing crack substance, i mean...additive.  it was the perfect complement to the over-sized juiced burger.  safely medium please.  i put my money on eating "half" the burger before giving up.  the fries, the burger... gracious gluttony.  i\'d be a complete fatty (and quite the feat) if i were able to finish it.  gluttony knows boundaries too...and i still had a "night" to get through.  the comatose would just have to wait a few more hours.   \n\nladies and gentleman, i have to say for the first time in about 10 years, i forgo seafood for RED MEAT...and it felt wonderful.  my friend highly enjoyed her sturgeon... she offered, but i happily declined.  i was much content stuffing my face with the burger &amp; fries instead.  that\'s what she said!\n\nit\'s important to note that this place is not your typical, traditional french fare.  rather modern american, nuances of french infused.  this place is brilliant- for upscale foodies, saavy\'nites, masochists, modernists... forgo the well mannered, prim &amp; proper tables and get your ass to the bar and enjoy the food there...(unless you obviously want to try the tasting menu...which i definitely do for next time...)  it\'s one hell of an experience wherever you end up.  or be smart and call to make reservations ahead of time.  that\'s what she said...']
['(5) EXCELLENT!  ~ Still my Favorite Restaurant!;-)\n\n* My Favs included the Octopus(best I ever had), Bourbon Pecan Ice Cream Tart &amp; the german Lagerbier!:-)  Great selection of "High Quality" Beers!  And (4) superb Amuse Bouches to cleanse our pallets!;-)']
["AMAZING! Service was phenomenal, our server was extra attentive and brought out mini tastings throughout the entire dinner which was very much appreciated! Wine selection was great, I ordered the Vermont pork cooked three ways and that was outstanding. Succulence and extreme richness! Ordered oysters for app and pork as the entree. Ordered a la carte rather than the 8 course tasting..maybe I'll try that next time! Will certainly return. Thank you for a great dining experience!"]
["My boyfriend and I have been to Craigie on Main twice before. We returned for a third time for dinner because the food has never disappointed. He also had a particular craving for a bone marrow special they have had in the past - they ended up not having it on the menu this time, but our experience was still flawless. The service on this trip made the experience better than the rest. My boyfriend and I like to have fun at restaurants, try new things and be generally surprised by the experience - our server delivered.\n\nI believe our server's name was Monica. She greeted us with a smile and made us feel welcome immediately. We asked about her recommendations and she let us know that pork was the way to go, but that as a starter she recommended the octopus and if we didn't want pork for a meal, then the bluefish was very popular that evening. We had planned on ordering oysters for an app, but were now torn with her recommendation of the octopus, so we asked her to surprise us. Surprise us, she did! We received one oyster to start and then the octopus app. It was the perfect treatment for our indecisiveness. I then ordered the bluefish and my boyfriend ordered the pork three ways. Delicious on all accounts. Further, our entrees were perfectly complemented by two beers of Monica's choosing - one German smoked beer and the other a Belgian. She helped us to expand our beer horizons and our palates. You can't ask for more in a dining experience. We will definitely be back. Thanks, Monica!"]
['It was a cozy experience. Service was excellent. The food was good - was there for brunch. The fresh squeezed was yummy...potato galettes were a modification - hash style - excellent. There were not many pork-free options (hence , the three stars). And was not able to order off the menu. Had to stick to the daily brunch specials - bummer - which meant I could only order bagel &amp; lox.']
["My dining experience at Craigie on Main was legend (wait for it) dary! \n\nMy girl friend and I made a Friday night dinner reservation for 6:30 pm. We were both stoked b/c of all the great things we have heard about this place. The chef, Tony Maws, was a James Beard Award Finalist - Best Chef Northeast in 2009 and 2010. Yes, I swoon over big name chefs. :)\n\nAnyway, we arrive promptly around 6:25 pm (pay attention to the time in this Yelp review). The hostess took our jackets and showed us to our table. We sat down and was ready for an amazing feast. Without a doubt, we knew we had to try the ultimate Craigie on Main tasting menu, which was an eight course meal. \n\nEach course was great and distinct in its flavor profile. We enjoyed a variety of fish, pasta, sweetbread, venison, duck, etc.. Oh, it was a freakin' EPIC eight course meal. We started out light and small. So, we were stoked.. thinking alright, we can do this tasting menu of small bites. However, by course 4, the flavors and portions started picking up, crescendoed to full blast with sweetbread followed by venison and duck sausage (this latter dish was presented to us by the one and only Tony Maws). Anyway, by course 6, I was pretty much done, feeling overwhelmed and extremely full. The portions were quite generous, so you definitely get your money's worth. However, I stuck it out and experience the end of the meal with a beautifully decorated dessert dish... ginger cheesecake and chocolate mousse cake or some sort and followed by hot warm cider and home-made marshmallow. \n\nFinally, our waitress presented our bill which was accompanied by two delicious mini macarons. The damage was pretty bad.. around $150 per person, but hey, we stayed and ate at the restaurant for exactly 4 hours. Yes, we didn't leave until 10:30 pm, so I'd say we got our money's worth. \n\nWhile the food was delicious and epic, my only concern for this place was the layout of the place... I normally like open kitchen restaurants, b/c I like to see the action of the kitchen. However, Craigie on Main's kitchen kind of took over part of the dining room and as a result, the kitchen noise of chopping, timer beeping, chefs communicating, etc.. blended over to the dining area.. so, it was rather loud, hard to engage in conversation and hear the music of the restaurant. Anyway, it was just slightly annoying.. :( \n\nAnyway, Craigie on Main... I will be back, but will probably stick with the three course meal and call it a night. However, thanks for helping me break my own restaurant eating record of freakin' 4 hours! :)"]
['Awarding the food, drink and service less than five stars for Craigie on Main would be a travesty. Excellent!']
['I\'ve been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time.  It was good, just not as fantastic as I expected.\n\nI tried the 8-course tasting menu.  I had to because... if one person at the table gets the tasting menu, everyone has to get it.  The reason was not clearly explained by the waitress, but I expect it\'s because it\'s hard for them to coordinate the timing when one person is getting 8 courses and others are getting 3. \n\nWe counted the courses.  Including the amuse bouche and the sorbet palate cleanser, there were nine (so I guess one of those doesn\'t count).  Presentation is lovely, portions are small. If you\'re hungry don\'t fool around with the six course version.  \n\nWhen they have to come up with 8 courses every day, selling the restaurant on novelty and what\'s fresh in the market, naturally not everything is going to be as successful as if they worked on each dish for a long time.  So that\'s the story here.  Some things on the tasting menu I liked (the stuffed cabbage, the pate and terrine, the sorbet), some things were mundane (the latkes), some things were more pretty than flavorful (cod with beets).  I can see the fun of the experience, but it\'s a lot to pay for the uneven quality. \n\nThere were pistachios on so many things for some reason.  Why? Are they currently in season in Massachusetts?  It is a very assertive nut, does not go with cabbage stuffed with lamb and rice and half the other stuff they tossed it on.  When it does work with the dish (rice pudding) it could be ground up a bit so it flavors every bite.  Anyway these are details that won\'t help you, as the tasting menu will obviously not be the same when you go there.  \n\nExtra praise for all the tableware.  I hate when servers put my old fork back on the table and expect me to use it for the next course, so I thought it was classy that Craigie gives me new silverware for each course.  We looked forward to the little ritual of setting silverware that happened each time, like an overture to the next course.   \n\nThe service was friendly, enthusiastic even.  (Our waitress said "Yay!" and did a little hop of happiness when we ordered the tasting menu).   But it was very slow, probably because they had to arrange each tiny leaf of microgreen on each teaspoon of condiment and so forth.  We started eating at a little before 8, and didn\'t finish until well after 10.  It only takes about 2 minutes to eat each course, and there\'s a good 10-15 minutes between courses while you\'re staring at an empty plate, so go with a good conversationalist and plenty of stories to tell!  \n\nOverall, not worth $360 for two, including two glasses of wine, one cocktail and tip.  (The bartending was good BTW.) I\'m glad I went to experience it, but  probably would not go again unless everyone is briefed in advance about the tasting menu thing. I\'d like to order a la carte and see what they can do with dishes that they\'ve mastered.  \n\nAnd if that ever happens, I\'ll definitely update this review!  After all, maybe it\'s my fault, in a way, maybe I\'m just not the type of customer that\'s right for the tasting menu approach, that person who likes to "put myself in the hands of the chef."  I mean, I have to cook to please my family every day.  So when I go out to eat, I like to be the one in charge.']
["My first experience at Craigie was 3/5. We got the chef's tasting menu, and (possibly) because we are Asian, they decided to give us 8 courses of Asian fusion. I can't say it was bad, but it also wasn't good. Everything just tasted okay. The ingredients were really fresh, but they killed it with muted fake Asian flavors. For $150, I did not leave a satisfied customer (I wrote this on their comment card). So I was wondering why everyone loves Craigie when the food was just okay.\n\nI came back a second time for their Farm Fresh Event. The food was so much better this time around. No sriracha, miso, sesame oil, etc. It was everything you could expect from a farm to table meal, topped off with a delicious dessert. I'd come back again."]
["Get ready to set your expectations high and turn on cruise control.\n\nMe and my husband enjoyed a relaxing 2.5-hour 6-course + 2 half-bottles-of-wine SPLURGE of a meal at Craigie for our first anniversary.  Our meal began with cool, bright, and fresh, followed by umami punch, then tantalizing technique and texture, to home hearty, to man-that-is-good, bisected with clean, and ending on a cloud from heaven.\n\nOur dining experience was the best I have ever had: the staff know their sh*t but deliver with complete ease.  They must telepathically communicate, because somehow we were met with 4+ different staff who never got in the others' way.  We were never rushed.  Our meal came with a congratulatory glass of champagne and a card signed by T. Maws (so sweet).  All of these things, including the creative, thoughtful, colorful, delicious, satisfying, filling, and locally foraged meal, made this once in a lifetime meal (being a 1st anniversary, but hopefully not my last feast at Craigie) worth every single penny.\n\nThey don't even mind if you lick, scoop, and soak-up every last bit on the plate.  You're going to want to."]
["Had a delectable dinner at Craigie tonight. We opted for the chef's tasting menu and highly recommend it. Each of the six courses was perfectly flavored, beautifully plated and oh so satisfying. I tried things I never knew I would like. The service was the best I have experienced in the greater Boston area. This place deserves all the praise and high ratings it receives - go! You won't be disappointed."]
["A really special place for a special meal. \nCame here on Friday night with reservations for 5:30 in the bar area. I have a sesame allergy and when notified prior, the hostess made a point to let the chef know and they had 2 sesame seed free brioche buns ready for us, pending our timely arrival. They did assure us that the burgers are first come first serve, so we made sure to arrive 15 minutes prior to the reservation to ensure us a burger and a good spot in line. \n\nThey have very knowledgable wait staff as well as bartenders. The bartender was able to recommend a good beer that went with the burger for each of us based on our beer preference, and prior to beer I had an earl gray and champagne cocktail that about blew my socks off. \n\nWhat did we eat?\nThe Spanish Octopus à la Plancha. \nA delicious tentacle of moist, perfectly cooked and charred octopus. This was a perfect appetizer sized portion for 2 people. There was a lovely green salad underneath which was not overdressed and complimented the richness of the meat just perfectly. \n\nDuck Fat Carrots\nBeautifully roasted carrots with a rich, divine duck fat flavor. You MUST get these if they are offered. They were a special on Friday Feb 21 when we went. \n\nSplit the Craigie Burger. \nWe can both attest to the fact that this is the best burger we have eaten. A very reasonable portion to share (about 7-8 oz even when cooked), we got it cooked medium rare and it was served with thick cut fries and a lovely celery slaw which was to die for. \nWhat makes it so good? There is something to be said about impeccable meat quality and simple ingredients. A burger does not need to be piled high with unnecessary additions. This was served with a light cheese (A cheddar) and a housemade ketchup and homemade pickles.\n\nSimple, executed well, with impeccably knowledgable staff is the way to run a restaurant. I an truly impressed by the hospitality and accommodation of something as simple as pre-baking a bun. \nGo, try a few different things, they only make 18 burgers a night, so be on time. \n\n(We didn't eat the chicken for 2, but saw it being served a table over, oh my gosh. I would come back to try it.)"]
["One of my favorite restaurants in the Boston area. I try to treat myself to the tasting menu every year or two and while I've preferred some over others, it never disappoints. Other items - burger, drinks, wine list - are superb as well."]
["Craigie on Main has never stood out to me when passing it on the street. I always assumed from its unassuming exterior that is was just a local pub-like restaurant in Kendall Square. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out what a foodie hot spot this is in Boston, after being invited to tag along to dinner with some friends.\n\nThe food itself was exotic, and in some cases a little strange. The entrees themselves were pretty small....think small beautifully presented food at big prices. Although you can dress up here, the atmosphere seemed casual to me. You'll have to make reservations if you want to guarantee yourself a seat, or be one of the first in line to get a spot at the bar right when they open. On the night we went, the bar line was down the block already at 5:30 pm.\n\nWhile some might think of the food as pretentious, the service, for the most part, was not. I think the hostess came off as a bit unwelcoming,  but the waiters were great. I liked how willing they were to explain what different ingredients and items were on the menu, and didn't make you feel silly for not knowing in the first place. The food I could eat was yummy. I tried the chicken for two, which was super tender and juicy. They even showed us the whole chicken before cutting it for us. I just wish it came with some sort of side. Their iconic dish, the pig's head, was scary to look at. Our friends seemed to enjoy it though, and it came with little pancakes to serve the meat in. There is something just really strange about ripping flesh off a head on your table. I was adventurous to try the pig tails, which were tasty and reminded me a lot of fried chicken wings. The pasta ragu appetizer was very good too. Overall, although I was happy to have the experience of coming here once, I just don't think this kind of place is for me!"]
["I somehow felt guilty making a reservation for bar seats at Craigie on Main, interested in only one thing: the burger. Now off menu and offered in limited quantities, I was afraid of being resented for needing to try this world famous creation. \n\nAs it turns out, the staff at Craigie is impeccable in all aspects and the only anxiety about ordering the burger should be whether or not you showed up early enough to snag one. Start with an expertly made cocktail, put in an order of (admittedly pricey) pigs tails to start and wait for burger bliss. \n\nThe burger is built on a freshly baked sesame bun (thank you, thank you THANK YOU for eschewing brioche) which maintains structure even after a good soaking of juice from the patty. The meat blend has been talked about endlessly, but do believe Chef Maws has done right here. The dehydrated miso is a unique touch, but I did wish for a bit more salt on the patty itself. Housemade pickles, tangy celery root slaw, mace ketchup, and farm fresh tomatoes (summertime only, but integral to the burger's success) bring the whole package together. The fries are good for wedge style, but it's not my preferred mode of fried potatoes. \n\nIs the burger worth the hassle and $19 price tag? I'd say at least once, yes. Although I don't have an overwhelming desire to head back for the early bird dinner to ensure I score one, the experience made me want to plan a tasting menu excursion soon, and very soon."]
["I'd like to think that I know a lot about food. I've tasted it and experienced it in many ways growing up in France and it's always been a huge part of my life. The food network is always on in my apartment and I spent quite a bit of time in the kitchen when I can. Hell, the only reason why I'm not in the culinary industry is because I'm allergic to seafood which would have limited me. But I digress. I've had many meals but the one I've had earlier this evening at Craigie on Main was one of the best.\n\nTheir menu is very modern and eclectic and we were lucky enough to get the ringside seats (there's only 4 of them available in the restaurant) because a previous reservation had cancelled rendering them free. Those very special seats are for a select and very lucky few and overlook the kitchen directly. You even get to interact with the chef a little bit. That alone made my night. \n\nThen came the amuse-bouche, which in my case was pork belly sliced very thin over fennel and mozzarella. It was very tasty and opened up my pallet nicely for what was a memorable meal.\n\nNot being able to eat seafood I settled for Potage of Sweet Butter and Sugar Corn which was absolutely exquisite. They replaced the seafood sausage pieces that come with it with fried squash flowers. A very interesting item that I had never tried. At that point I was very impressed and was looking forward to my entree. I saw that they offered bone marrow and it has to be my favorite dish ever, all time. It's literally what I want for my last meal and it's not found everywhere so I jumped on the occasion and thus ordered the hangar steak which comes with bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice and huitlacoche jus. It was very intriguing yet very tasty. The bone marrow portion was HUGE which made my night as well. It was so, so good!\n\nThe wine paired it very well. Then we had a sour milk pannacotta. I had quite a bit of wine at that point and can't quite remember what it was exactly, but it was flavored with tea and had a very delicate, soothing texture. It was wonderful. My friend and I both ordered the same desert, which was the Market Fruits Crisp, a crumble which featured berries. It wasn't over sweet at all which was nice. They let the natural sugars in the berries express themselves.\n\nTo end the meal, we were given shots of a hibiscus froth.\n\nOverall it was a very intriguing, fun and wonderful experience going to Craigie on Main. The prices are high but you get what you pay for. Their menus change daily based on what's fresh and what looks good and the chef and staff are very attentive to the food they serve and the details making for an excellent experience. A dish never sat more than 10 seconds at the pass before being picked up by the runners.\n\nWhat I do recommend you do is try to get the ringside seats (or whatever it's are called) so that you can sit and get to peak at the kitchen. It's very entertaining and you'll learn quite a bit. The head chef is very friendly and for those feeling adventurous, you can order a half of a pigs head, roasted. They have a whole bunch of interesting items on their menus and my friend and I made a deal that we will be heading there every three months from now on to experience the menus as they change with the seasons.\n\nI love this place, it's a real gem! And boy will I remember these lovely 2 and a half hours of delightful food!"]
['6 course prix fixed menu is the way to go. I did not see anyone get the half pig head which I really wanted to see but my courses were so delicious I was distracted and could have totally missed it.\n\nClean delicious flavorful and thoughtful food. Would go back any day. \n\nThe wait staff was fabulous. Service impeccable and smooth. \n\nValet parking is $12.']
["Third time's the charm. Finally got ringside seats, and it was awesome. I'd forego eating if I could sit there and watch the symphony of chef's create these beautiful dishes all night. Ok maybe I'd want to eat too. But these seats are great.\n\nWe did the chef's whim (Sunday night after 9) and this was probably my favorite time at Craigie thus far. Tony wasn't there (even though the website says 'Chef Tony Maws cooks for your table...') but the meal was still spectacular. I had met him at the Smoke This Rib Fest in Cambridge a few weeks prior and he was more than happy to chat for a few (and to take a picture).\n\nChef's Whim took about 2 hours (9:30 to 11:30) and service was great from start to finish. It was almost as satisfying to see the cooks break down the kitchen and clean everything as it was to watch them cook. Being ringside leaves the kitchen completely transparent, and it is so fun to watch the communication and camaraderie between everyone there throughout the night as they create the food for the dining room.\n\nIn terms of the food, I don't think there was a misstep all night. This is definitely the way to do it if you don't want to break the bank but still get delicious food (57$ for 6 courses). They give you a notecard to write down the dishes (see attached picture), but for me the highlight was (surprisingly) the pumpkin soup with crab. I didn't think the butter soup at Menton could be beat but I liked this even more. Savory, sweet, and spicy with texture from the crab meat was perfect. The kampachi sashimi was delicious with the pine nut cream and pear. There was only one meat course, but the lamb neck was meltingly tender. We got the brussel sprouts and bone marrow sides, which were perfect per usual.\n\nThe green apple sorbet palette cleanser and three different desserts (one for each of us) was the perfect nightcap.  Three 6 course meals, 6 cocktails, a beer, and two sides ran us $340 with tax and tip. Not bad.  We got to converse with a couple of the cooks as they were cleaning the kitchen at the end, and as I think of our experience I still marvel over the organized chaos that is the Craigie kitchen. Can't wait to come back."]
["I had a wonderful meal here last year and I'm counting down the days until I go back.\n\nThe service was polite and knowledgeable, the atmosphere was elegant and energetic, and the food was wonderfully creative and delicious. \n\nWe got to sit at the chef's table, which consisted of 4 bar stools along the kitchen. It overlooked the people who were in charge of plating appetizers. Such a stressful job, I don't think I could ever work in a kitchen. \n\nAlthough the tasting menu was ubiquitous (and delicious looking), we opted to create a little pig feast of our own. We had the crispy pig tails, trio of pates, crispy pig ears, and the pig's head for 2. It ended up being a little heavy (as we were warned), but so tasty. I was most impressed with our 2 pig appetizers. The pig tails had an asian flavor (prob the fish sauce) and were topped with crispy onions. The pig ears were atop this salad of prawns and citrus flavors. Outstanding! Of course, there is no rival to the pig's head. The presentation alone was worth ordering it, not to mention releasing my carnal instincts upon it. \n\nThis is definitely one of the best fine dining experiences I've had anywhere. Thanks Craigie, for creating such a memorable night."]
["One of my all-time favorite restaurants. Had one of the best meals in my life. Had the 5 course and they made it all vegan. Unbelievable!!! Great service too. Going back again in a few weeks-can't wait!"]
["Went recently for the first time. Got there at 5:30, not crowded at all, great time to go. Our server was very friendly and extremely knowledgable and helpful with the menu! We winded up trying the tasting menu. While I am glad we tried it once, next time I'd choose to order off the regular menu. The courses were good overall but there were a few that I didn't care for or wouldn't have chosen myself. Because the tasting menu changes often I don't think it's worth reviewing the food but the first two courses contained raw fish and while I'm very adventurous and will try anything, I don't love raw fish/cold soups and for $85 would've preferred to order something else. The food was plentiful though and after 5 courses I was quite full! The last two savory courses were excellent. The desserts were a bit fancy for my tastes but the chocolate dessert was very tasty and I liked how they give two different desserts. I would love to go back and try their famous burger! Atmosphere was cool, next time I'd plan to sit near the kitchen to watch the cooking, love the open kitchen concept!"]
["Went early on a Friday night and sat  bar side , so we could get a chance at one of the 18 nightly burgers.\n\nGreat staff, although the waiter deftly pointed me to the most expensive beer on the menu.  Guys, this is Boston.  Why wouldn't you have Harpoon IPA as a choice?  Sierra Nevada is great, but Harpoon is local, fresher, and just as good.\n\nMain problem I had was the physical layout.  We were at a long table, arranged parallel to the bar, with very little space to move.  Every time some one walked behind my chair  (often) I got slammed or jostled.  After 90 minutes I felt like I needed a chiropractor.  Gotta believe that table is regular trouble for both customers and staff, and they've made a conscious decision on revenue over comfort.\n\nOn the minus side, the burgers.  There were three left, we grabbed them all for the table.  They were a bit over-seasoned with some salt/herb mix, so the flavor of the beef was masked.  Also a bit too dense, with a pate quality rather than fat.  I wouldn't order one again, given the other choices.\n\nThe fried clams were very good, but a bit too frou-frou in presentation and sauce.  If you're going to go fried clams, give me a greasy half-pint paper container and a mayo-based tartar sauce.  Full whole belly please.  Again, we're in Boston here.\n\nBest thing I had was the octopus,  Served with an ink (?) based sauce on micro-greens, it was perfectly cooked.  Savory, complex, delicious.  I could have done three servings.\n\nDamned good, but not really up to the hype."]
["I dined at at Craigie on Main one Saturday evening, after glowing recommendations from my sister and other Bostonian friends. My mother and I were in town for 48 hour trip and this was where we decided to have dinner.\n\nFood-wise, it does not live up to the hype; though atmospherically, the open kitchen and the choices in low light and furniture all lend an intimate cadence to your meal. (But more on the open kitchen later). The service was also impeccable; but good service should be the cap to a fantastic meal, not the most positive part of a dining experience. +1\n\nWe decided to get the 6 course tasting menu and started out with a few drinks. Whoever the bartender is, he probably saved the night, to the extent that the one drink I ordered thrilled me in its perfect balance of liquor to mixers ratio. It was a perfect cocktail. +1\n\nAn amuse bouche arrived of kona kampachi with some sort of apple gastric, radishes, and microgreens. It lacked seasoning, but that was forgivable, despite the fact it did absolutely nothing to amuse my palate. 2/5\n\nOur first course was a scallop sashimi dish with olive oil, more microgreens, olives (castelvetrano? I don't think we were ever told), seasoned with salt and fresh black pepper. This was decent, but while the amuse bouche was underseasoned, this one was overly salty. Indeed, the salt was a little overwhelming to something as delicate as a raw scallop. 3/5\n\nOur next course was an Atlantic cod served over pieces of uni, a poached local oyster, microgreens (what else), and a sauvignon beurre blanc. This was also incredibly salty, and while the beurre blanc was good, I kept needing my water to help wash it down. It overwhelmed the fish and uni. 1/5\n\nThe third course was a housemade pasta with 40 year old age parmesan and a poached egg. I thoroughly enjoyed this course and loved how the unctuousness of the raw yolk as a sauce helped balance out the nutty, saltiness of the parmesan covered pasta. This is where I need to start speaking about the kitchen and the expediter. (But the food itself was 4/5.)\n\nSo, open kitchens are great, but they also open themselves up to be observed, particularly by people who love food (like myself). I loved that everyone tasted their food as they were going and re-seasoned as needed. What I was not thrilled about? While /everyone/ else in the kitchen threw away tasting spoons as they tasted, the expediter used the plating spoon to taste and then dip it back into the pot or pan to continue plating. And then tasted some more. I'm sure this has happened before in my life, where a chef or expediter has done this very behavior in a closed kitchen, but you'd think there'd be some more care in an open kitchen scenario. He did this for /every/ dish that you could taste. :P It was incredibly gross and not what I would expect of a restaurant that has as many accolades as Craigie on Main. I would have mentioned something at the time, but my sister was desperate for my mom and I to love this place and I really didn't want to burst her bubble; since this is/was her favorite restaurant in Boston. But really? Disgusting. -5 (ETA: and really, what do you say in this kind of situation: um, could you please ask the expediter to stop doing that?)\n\nThe fourth course was a beef two ways: seared tenderloin medallion with a beef tongue and some sort of red wine sauce on top of pureed turnips. I love my beef rare. I joke about how I like it mooing still. What I don't like is when blue beef (and this was blue) is so difficult to cut (as a tenderloin cut) that I have to wrestle with it with my sharp steak knife. I left most of this plate untouched. It was not up to the caliber I expected. (0/5)\n\nWe also supplemented our meal with bone marrow, as I love bone marrow on toast; it's like a fatty, rich, yummy meat butter. The bones were under roasted, leaving the marrow more gelatinous than buttery. It was disappointing. (2/5)\n\nNow this is where I am not sure what happened. I've never been in a restaurant situation where the intermezzo/palate cleansing course is an actual course. I'm assuming, though, that's what it is, because otherwise I'm left with 5 courses rather than 6. The palate cleanser was delicious, down to the basil seeds in lychee jelly. But it seems like it'd be hard to mess up sorbet. (5/5)\n\nDessert was done in 4 ways, as we had a party of four and each person got a different dessert. I loved mine; a pear tart with a butter 'butter' (like butter flavored peanut butter type deal), with an almond ice cream, goji berries, and rice puffs. The other desserts were tasty, but not my style (but my sister loved hers, and her fiancé seemed to like his, and my mom ate all hers), so I feel the server did a fantastic job at deciding who got what; or made a fantastic accidental choice of it. (4/5)\n\nWe ended the meal with strawberry macarons that were decent; missing on the airy crispness, but with a nice chew to them."]
['Back for a 2nd visit about a year and a half later. The place totally rocks it! Amazing food, outstanding service and a warm, comfortable space. There are some things I ALWAYS do when I am in Cambridge. I stay at the the Charles and I have dinner at Craigies on Main....they are non-negotiable!']
['Amazing excellent cocktails, food, and service... Came here for graduation dinner after booking 2 months in advance for dinner. \n\nTotally worth it! \nGo for sure! Small portion sizes which is nice and amazing oysters!']
["Love this place, whether eating a burger in the bar or do an 11 course tasting, you can't go wrong. The wait staff is attentive and knowledgeable and they make it a dining experience.  And everything is delicious!"]
['Did I enjoy it? Yes. Would I go back for a full-on meal? No. Perhaps it was the hype, or perhaps it was the fact that they just changed their chef de cuisine, or perhaps it was because we went at an unwittingly poor time (more on that below), but I was way underwhelmed. \n\nFOOD.\nWe did the 8 course tasting menu because, honestly, their pricing scheme pushes you that way. it was our anniversary and we thought, What the heck. The 8 courses were supplemented with an app amuse and a dessert amuse, plus truffles with the check. We did leave completely stuffed, but for over a $400 tab, we had better be!\n\nSome things were amazing (like the dessert amuse, a Concord grape and kaffir lime sorbet served with basil seeds and a vanilla foam; venison with a sweet apple puree was my husband\'s favorite). My favorite savory was hake roasted just past raw--flaky, tender, sea-salty, with lovely tender roasted mussels and nice bright radish curls. \n\nMost things were yummy but not special, and a couple things were mis-steps (an amuse of kombucha-marinated mackerel so unrelievedly fishy it seemed like no one could have tasted it before leaving the kitchen; pork belly served lukewarm so the fat was rubbery instead of melty; and while I loved it, there were *bones* in the hake--at this price point, not cool). Also, in 8 courses, not ONE was vegetable-based or focused. I felt heavy and too full of protein at the end of the meal. The only veggie-ish course was pasta made of corn...with rabbit and guanciale. Bread tasted good but was either old or had been stored in plastic--tough, chewy crusts.\n\nAMBIENCE.\nI like the decor. They seem to be shooting for bustling French cafe-feeling, which they do sort of achieve...but only too well. In the main dining room, there are simply too many tables for the space; it\'s crowded. Despite the nice lighting and warm surroundings, it does not feel intimate or cozy. The bathrooms were utilitarian and not immaculate--in one, a trash bin was overflowing--and again, just took away from what should be a luxe experience.\n\nThe music was flat-out awful. Alt-rock, electronic blues, stuff I might want to listen to while driving or working out but certainly not while lingering over a ridiculously extravagant meal. It was so bad we asked our waitress about it, who said that on Sunday nights after 9 it\'s a "manager\'s special" of music where they play whatever they want. We were seated at 7:30, though, and the music was something both my husband and I noticed right away. It seriously detracted from our experience, partly because it was being played loudly and compounded the issue of poor acoustics in the space. We often could not hear each other across the table. Hardly romantic.\n\nSERVICE.\nAfter a chilly reception at the door, we had a darling waitress. The pacing of the courses was excellent. However, beverage service was off-kilter, and while she was super friendly and attentive, the waitress was weak on wine (and it\'s a small list). We had a spill at the table and it was handled well once someone noticed. \n\nIn sum, the next time I want a real splurge dinner out I\'ll return to the superb Journeyman or try for Bondir; and for a celebratory delicious meal whose tab is easier to stomach, I will keep returning to my beloved Bergamot.']
["Everything I tried here was excellent.  The pork three ways, the fried pork tails, the pasta, the drinks, the octopus, the fish, and the panna cotta.  It was all just wonderful.  The bread was nice too, with a good crackly crust and airy crumb.\n\nThe entrees were quite good, but I highly recommend the so-tender octopus, the fried pork tails, and the mole panna cotta.  The panna cotta has a thick consistency, with a chocolate and cayenne flavor, and is topped with a spoonful of avocado-banana purée that just melds the flavors together and rounds it all out into this pleasant and tender sum that is greater than the excellent parts...oh, and it comes with corn tortilla ice cream that cools off the mild burn and some crunchy bits that provide texture variety.\n\nThe prix fixe is not going to leave you stuffed, but it's a solid enough meal that I didn't leave hungry.  Staff was friendly and efficient.  Wish they had a bit more space...I accidentally elbowed a waitress squeezing between my chair and another table about 8 inches away."]
["I went here for a birthday dinner instead of my usual L'Espalier (mainly due to Yelp reviews, actually). The service could have been better, but the food was great! The drinks were strong and well-balanced. I liked the open kitchen layout, and I definitely liked the prices better too!!"]
["We went to Craigie for my husband's birthday, as he'd been wanting to go for a while, and it was just ... disappointing. It's been a week or two and the things that stand out in my memory are that disappointment, and the ridiculously long time it took to be served the three-course meal. A lot of sitting there, after a course had been cleared, waiting for the next one. NOT what you expect at a restaurant of this reputation. And the food ... just doesn't stand out in my memory except that I left thinking through all the better meals I'd had at places of similar price and reputation and, more, the better meals I'd had at places without Craigie's reputation -- or prices. The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't what you go to a place like Craigie on Main expecting.\n\nFor $250 for two people, I don't look to be bored by the experience of waiting for good but ultimately forgettable food."]
['It comes time for me to write my review about Craigie after my second visit.\n\nFirst of all, this is a **nice** restaurant. The atmosphere is lovely (though time #1 we sat at a high-top table which doesn\'t feel fancy and was really loud) and the food is made from fine ingredients at a high price. The food really is quite good. The service is attentive (overly so at times with multiple servers coming to the table).\n\nHowever, I have a bunch of gripes. Mostly, I think this is a nice restaurant for people who want to feel like foodies but aren\'t actually foodies. It\'s fantastic if you\'ve never been to Bondir, for example. \n\nThe first time we went, we gave some feedback via OpenTable, as we\'d spent $400 for a dinner that we just weren\'t blown away by at all (we\'d had the tasting menu) and it was frickin LOUD and we couldn\'t hear each other across the table. Craigie responded by sending us a $100 gift certificate which we used recently.\n\nOur second time was much better (we stuck to entrees), but I still left feeling very "meh" about it overall. \n\nHere are my gripes:\n--the tastes don\'t match the price. if you\'re paying 100$+ for a tasting menu or 38$ for an entree, it should be excellent, with fine and interesting tastes.There are many other fancy restaurants in the Boston/Cambridge area that are half the price of Craigie, but better.\n--Craigie uses certain ingredients and serves certain dishes to SEEM gourmet, not because they actually taste good (example: cow tongue, fish head, pig\'s head, etc.). I love weird food and am not a picky eater at all, but the menu always comes across as trying too hard, not genuine. \n--The first time we went, we were served a fish head. This bugged me, not because fish head is gross, but because it\'s basically trash that they\'re trying to pass off as gourmet, and the nice little cheeky party of the fish head isn\'t worth it, and all I could think about was being at a seafood market in Korea and seeing piles of fish heads in the trash. I know it\'s dumb to be overly fixated on the fish head, but I am.\n\nAll in all, Craigie on Main is a "very good" restaurant with "very good" food, but it\'s not excellent or outstanding, and it\'s not a 5 star write home about experience. If the prices were a bit more reasonable, (like, say, maybe 25$ for an entree), it would be an excellent place that I\'d recommend. I just think you leave thinking "I just spent $400 on that?"\n\nReally, we just weren\'t blown away by either visit to Craigie, and for the price--- I WANT TO BE BLOWN AWAY.']
["This review is for an a la carte meal at the bar. \n\nI had the duck fat roasted Brussels sprouts and the pork 3 ways. The sprouts were mediocre. Flavor not impressive, and served lukewarm. The pork, while tasty, was nothing special in terms of either presentation or flavor. \n\nOn the flip side, the bartenders were great, as were the bourbon drinks. If I went back, I'd try out the burger, rather than one of the seemingly overpriced regular menu items."]
["This is one of the best meals I've ever had in my entire life!  We had the 6 course tasting menu and each course was better than the last.  The chefs pay close attention to every detail and each bite is perfectly seasoned.  \n\nNow normally I'm not one for overly fancy food.  But this meal delivered on taste in addition to being beautiful on the plate.  The highlights were the beet pasta with venison ragout (sounds like an odd combination, but it was to DIE for... I still dream about this pasta) and the scallop sashimi.  \n\nI also love the ambiance of the restaurant.  It's very casual and laid back despite having upscale food.  It was very cozy and warm and inviting inside.  The staff is also great!  They're knowledgeable and attentive without being overwhelming. \n\nNext time I'm in Cambridge, I'll definitely be back!"]
["Oh Craigie, after all I'd heard about you, I had high expectations. I thought your food would be mindblowingly creative and delicious. For the bf's birthday, I treated him to a 6 course tasting at Craigie. Here are my thoughts on it:\n\n1. Squid noodles- good, especially if you like fish sauce which I definitely do. Unfortunately, the portion size was about the same as an amuse bouche. Actually, the lack of an amuse surprised me; I feel as though most new American restaurants offer them as well as French restaurants.\n\n2. Hiramasa sashimi- awesome! Especially with the avocado it was layered upon. About a 2-3 bite portion.\n\n3. Grouper with beet dashi broth, rock shrimp, mushrooms, horseradish creme.- Really good, the fish was cooked perfectly.\n\n4. Croquette of pied au cochon with a sunnyside duck egg over lentil salad- well-balanced and rich.\n\n5. Chicken thigh confit with potato galette and onions- best chicken I've ever had! Honestly. Crispy skin, tender juicy and tasty meat. The onions that came with it were too sweet though. Big portion too!\n\n6. Dessert: Vanilla panna cotta with cardamom crunchies and bourbon ice cream with salted mexican chocolate (I think)- I remember both of them being really good. \n\nSo pretty much everything was tasty but I was expecting a little more craziness; the tasting seemed pretty tame for what I expected Tony Maws to be doing, ie, I could have gone to some other restaurant and gotten similar items. And nothing except for the chicken thigh confit was mindblowingly delicious. Also, I thought the sizing of each course was a little inconsistent. Great meal but I don't know if I'd do it again :/"]
['Update:\n\nUpon reading my review, the manager Kyla contacted me to discuss our experiences. She stressed that the chef\'s 6 course dinner is supposed to be similar in size to a regular entree. This means that we could have gotten the same amount of food for way less by just ordering from the regular menu. Keep this is mind if you feel included to go to Craigie. \n\nAs far as the price is concerned, Kyla countered that they use local fresh ingredients, like this even begins to vindicate the price. Plenty of restaurants use fresh local ingredients and don\'t charge over $50 a plate. Bondir (also a 10 minute walk from Craigie) bases their entire system on using fresh local sustainable ingredients only and their entrees do not exceed $30. So obviously, using the "fresh local" excuse to explain a $220 dinner is ridiculous.\n\nKyla offered us a complete refund and we took it. Now that is GREAT customer service, and we are very grateful to her for that. And we were so ashamed of ourselves for having paid so much for the food we got at Craigie that we donated part of the money we got back to the Boston Food Bank. \n\nSo, we got a free dinner. Since this is a rating of my personal experience at Craigie\'s it\'s only fair that I bump the review from 1/5 to 2/5 stars. 1 star for the friendly staff, and 1 star for the customer service.']
['There are some words that I automatically like when I hear them used:\n+ effervescent\n+ duckfat\n+ whimsical\n\nso when I hear of a 4 / 6 course tasting menu available on Sundays called "Chef\'s Whim," I am instantly intrigued / enamored / ready.  Oh, Craigie, I was ready.\n\nThe BFF and I had ourselves a reso at 9:30p.  The host was super perky and kept using the word "absolutely" to answer any question we had.  I never realized the versatility of that word, but love it!  (Absolutely!)\n\nWe ordered the 4 course and braced for the chef\'s whims that would ensue upon our table shortly.  We tried to reject the cold, crusty bread basket, but the lure of the triangle wedge of butter was hard to ignore.  The butter was good.  The bread was cold.\n\nThe amuse bouche was a salty flat cylinder of white tuna topped with shiny black caviar and paired with a parmesanesque cracker.  I liked the flavor of the fish but yo, that amuse bouche seemed as if it had been am-bouched by a salt canister.  The amuse bouche had been as-salted.  Man, I will be here all night.\n\nThe appetizer was a tiny salad of greens and late summer tomatoes, topped with slivers of fried pig ears.  Crunchy.  Juicy.  Ripe.  Light.  Solid.\n\nThe second appetizer were deep fried cod cheeks topped with pickled lemon.  Tasted like fish tempura you\'d get from a Japanese resto.  Like.  Piping hot, crispy and good, but not that interesting? That pickled lemon was spot on though.\n\nThe entree featured two slices of ribeye, some strands of oxtail pastrami and steamed/sauteed greens that tasted like bok choy and seared/griddled baby carrots.  I think I was most bummed by the size of the entree because two slices of meat seems a bit on the skimpo side, but maybe because I\'m from TX, I just expect a whole cow to be slaughtered and served up on a platter for dinner.  The BFF said her ribeye was too chewy, and she ended up chewing the meat for flavor but then spitting the meat out on her napkin.  Reminded me of Seinfeld and the mutton episode.  I think the meat ended up falling out of her napkin at some point though - she didn\'t seem too concerned with seeing where it landed on the floor.  She\'s funny and gross.\n\nFor dessert, we were presented with two different plates: one a stone fruit cobbler with anise ice cream, the second whole wheat crepes with pear compote and goat milk ice cream.  The crunchy streusel on the cobbler was top notch, but the licoricey ice cream didn\'t really add anything to that dish / really didn\'t enjoy it.  The whole wheat crepes were bland and boring - bordering dry.  The compote was equally dull.  Appley and cinnamony.  C\'mon Craigie!  Where\'s the whimsy in this?\n\nAll in all - not an ultra fan of the whims of our night, but I did espy some major looking burgers being eaten at the bar, so I dare say, I will go out on a whim for that beefy beast on my next Boston visit.']
["After hearing a lot about this place from a friend this past year, Craigie on Main was on the agenda for my next visit to Boston.  \n\nFood (9.0/10) = Came here on a Sunday night for the Chef's Whim 4-course meal.  \n\n1) Amuse-bouche of Squid Noodles = I thought this was a nice way to start off a great meal.  It wasn't spectacular, but still delicious.\n\n2) Hamachi with avocado = the avocado went well with the the delicate piece of raw fish.  \n\n3) Olive oil poached halibut with beat salad, risotto, and shrimp = My #2 dish of the night.  Halibut was very delicate and the beat salad enhanced the flavors of the fish.\n\n4) Lamb 3 ways (tongue, loin, and belly) and Grilled Spanish Octopus = My friend doesn't eat lamb so she got the octopus, while the rest of us got the lamb. The octopus was cooked well and very tender.  The lamb 3 ways was my favorite dish of the night.  I've never had lamb tongue before, so the experience was a pleasant surprise.  The amount of resistance I felt cutting the tongue with my knife, was the same as cutting a piece of chicken breast.  However, once I placed a piece of it in my mouth, the texture of the tongue was very creamy.  A very unique experience.  The belly was the most flavorful of the 3, with all the juicy fat.\n\n5) Bone Marrow (ordered this extra for my party) = I decided to order this separately after watching it being prepared several times that night.  Bone marrow...mmm...pure fat in my mouth.  This is a great dish to share with 4-6 people.  Eating this practically by myself...not a good idea.  I quickly got a headache after eating this much bone marrow.  I basically drank a cup of oil.  I learned my lesson.  \n\n6) Desserts = \n(a) Sour Milk Panna Cotta (with coriander-cashew granola, dried cherry and kirsch puree, brown butter)\n(b) Apricot Frangipane Torte (with pistachio crust, grains of paradise, amaretto ice cream)\n(c) White asparagus ice cream \n\nAll of the desserts were delicious.  But the one that stood out the most was the white asparagus ice cream.  I love the creativity.  I never thought white asparagus could taste so good as a cold dessert.\n\nAmbiance (9.0/10) = This was a really cool place.  As you enter the restaurant, you can see the kitchen and all the chefs cooking.  \n\nService (10/10) = Wonderful service.  Our waiter was very knowledgeable with the food that evening.  The staff was attentive.  \n\nOverall Opinion = Craigie on Main is a great restaurant.  However, the reason I'm not giving the 5th yelp star was because most of the dishes I had didn't blow my mind.  Given this place's reputation, I had high expectations.  I had a hard time writing this review simply because I struggled to remember details of the dishes that night.  Would I recommend the Chef's Whim? Absolutely!  Would I come back to this restaurant? Of course.  I've heard their burgers are really good, and I witnessed multiple burgers being prepared that night.  So the next time I visit Craigie, I'll go for the burger.  And maybe that would push me to give this place the 5th star."]
["Best meal I've had in years. Let the chef and bar tender choose your path.  You won't be disappointed!"]
['Fantastic 5-star dinner. Prix fixe dinner outstanding. Food phenomenal and thoughtful. Service was outstanding. Worth every penny.']
["The food here was fantastic. I LOVED their octopus. I love to cook it at home, and I try it at most restaurants (not expecting much usually). This place wowed me with their octopus. Perfectly done. TENDER. Delicious. Don't pass it up, unless you're vegan or too squeamish. Our service here was comfortable and prompt. No one rushed us, and the waiter gave honest recommendations with regard to cocktails, which was to our benefit! They served me a tuna foam as an in between (we did not order it, it just came), and it was very flavourful and a great segue from app to dinner. My BF got their famous burger, and he was totally engrossed in it; we both loved our meals. One thing: I wouldn't recommend the corn, because they have so much more/better to offer here!"]
["Call me McKayla Maroney, but I was very unimpressed. \n\nGiven all of the hype surrounding how incredible the brunch menu supposedly is, I had very high expectations for this place. Sure, the environment is cozy, the servers are friendly and attentive, and the dishes are beautifully prepared. \n\nHowever, portions were tiny and the food was just so-so. The Grass-Fed Beef Cheek, Brisket, and Smoked Beef Tongue Hash - sounds delicious, right? - came out cold, soupy, and just plain inedible. The beef was overcooked, the egg had been sitting out way too long, and there was very little flavor. The House-Cured Scottish Sea Trout &amp; Mackeral Rillettes did not fair much better. While the sea trout concoction was pretty tasty, portions were just way too small to justify the $18 price tag. Not to mention, the bagel and accompaniments seemed like they were purchased straight out of Costco. The Coriander and Cashew Granola, and Organic Yogurt was also, sadly, a miss. The flavors just didn't work for me and there was way too little yogurt to balance the strong flavors from the coriander granola. \n\nThe only sweet spot in my meal came from the House-Made Donut with Confiture du Lait. Probably one of the best donuts I've ever hard. Perfectly crispy/fluffy and with just the right amount of sweetness to keep you coming back for more.\n\nOverall, however, I left the restaurant paying ~$75 for party of two (and this was without alcohol!). Way overpriced for a brunch that was just mediocre.\n\nMy advice? Walk a few blocks down to Cafe Luna to discover what a real brunch should taste like. You'll pay half the price and your stomach will thank you."]
["Came here for the burger special. It was ok, not worth the hype. You can get a much tastier burger elsewhere and for cheaper. We ordered an octopus appetizer which was good-- but not the best octopus I've ever had. We also had a few cocktails by the bar, but nothing memorable."]
["Based on the reviews, i was confident that Craigie on Main tasting menu would rival that of other restaurants that i had the pleasure to experience. This was not the case: neither the food nor the service would warrant 1 Michelin star. Although the staff was very attentive and friendly, the dishes arrived irregularly sometimes more than 20 min between plates. It seemed as if each dish in the tasting menu was submitted as a new order: one would think that the chefs would plan the plates for the entire menu and have them arrive with some regularity. not 40 mins for the 2nd dish and 20 mins between the third and 4th plate, etc. After about 2 hrs and half-way through the menu, we told our waitress that at this rate, that the final plate would arrive at 1am (we were seated at 8:30pm).\n\nRegarding the food, although each plate was carefully and skillfully prepared, creativity was lacking. I always look forward to chefs that successfully combine flavors in unexpected ways using interesting ingredients. There was an over salty tendency that diminished flavors of the otherwise interesting rabbit ragout. the grilled fish was very good as well, but the final dish of spare rib, pork croquet, and pork belly was heavy and perhaps not the right choice for the final plate. Finally, each plate in the tasting menu should stand alone, but also contribute to the progression of flavors among the series of dishes served. These plates appeared poorly integrated.\n\nOverall, we did not have a very good experience at Craigie on Main and we're not likely to return."]
["The bar staff made fun of my date when she said she didn't like the ginger beer. They neglected to mention it had Thai chili peppers in it! \n\nAlso, i did the long tasting menu here, and it had three straight white fish courses with Asian citrus and ponzu as the major flavor ingredients. Finally, i asked for a recommendation on a half bottle of white to start, was told the Trimbach was good. I expected the yellow label, and she brought out Freddie Emile. Opened without presenting. If you recommend a high end wine, be clear. Difference of $35 to $75."]
["Was just Ok. We were pretty disappointed actually. When you factor in the price maybe three stars is a bit too high. The service was mediocre and pushy. The fish was mediocre my wife's 18 dollars tomato salad was an embarrassment- 3 or 4  thin slices of mealy tomato with a sprinkling of couscous. Nice atmosphere, lousy neighborhood except Toscaninis next door is fantastic and always has been."]
['The overall dining experience is aesthetically pleasing to senses. Craigie on Main is probably one of the best fine dining restaurants I would recommend in Boston/Cambridge.']
['One of the best meals of my life, bar none.  We actually asked for and received a copy of the menu so we could remember what we ate.  We also carefully chose different items so that we never duplicated anything and could try the full range of porky goodness that Tony Maws and company was serving that night.  We also splurged on the drink pairings which were all spot on and complimented their dishes very well.\n\nThey started us off with Les Cochonailles, which was a small dish with many bite sized tasting of pork.  The fried crouton of pork cheek was a divinely salty treat, as was a small dollop of pate where I think the goal was to make a tastier version of deviled ham.  Mission accomplished.  Lastly was a light and fatty pork rind that didn\'t even require chewing.  You just put it on your mouth and allowed it to melt.  This was paired with a 2007 Sydre \'Argelette", Eric Bordelet.\n\nSecond choice for me was a salad of crisphy-fried pig ears and fresh shrimp with watercress, frisee, beets and bacon vinaigrette.  Surprising the pork did not overwhelm the dish.  The ears are less porky but chewy and long lasting.  I\'m not really a fan of beets, but when combined with everything else they mixed into a very tasty mouthful of food.  This came with a 2008 Pinot Blanc, Domaine Meyer-Fonee\n\nFor my date it was the red chile-rubbed St. Louis pork ribs with pickled peanuts, toasted garlic and jalapeno.  They were a bit to spicy to her heat-averse tongue but I thought the heat built up nicely towards the end and was very enjoyable.  This came with and Olde School Barleywine from Dogfish Head.\n\nFor the next course she had the blood sausage tagliatelle with suckling pig ragout and maitake mushrooms paired with a 2009 SP68, Occchipinti. The pork saugage was fantastic and really went well with the win. \n\nMy choice was the rye flour fusilli with a ragout of pork heart sausage and sea urchin.  Of the two pasta dishes this was by far our favorite.  The urchin lent a nice additional saltiness when you stumbled onto a piece.  This came with a 2008 Beta Delta, Tanutae Lageder.\n\nMy choice for the next course was braised pork cheeks with pig tongue confit, country sausage and garbanzo bean cassoulet.  Had etiquitte allowed I\'d have licked this plate clean.  I managed to maintain my composure and simply scrape as much goodness off my plate with a fork as could be had.  This came with a 2009 Beaujolais Villages, Damien Coquelet.\n\nShe got the Berkshire pork belly with morcilla (a Spanish blood sausage), bluefoot mushrooms, tangerines and pistachio butter.  All was fantastic and once again the ingredients really complement each other and the wine.  My date is not a huge fan of mushrooms but loved them in this dish.  This was served with a 2009 Chinon \'Les Galuches", Jean-Maurice Raffault.  \n\nAfter a refreshing grapefruit-Campari sorbet with champagne foam we moved onto dessert.  Mine was a huge piece of bourbon and pecan ice cream tart with lard crust and crunch bacon on top.  By itself it was absolutely decadent.  It was served with a Farmhouse Flip, which if memory serves (I had to ask the waiter as the ingredients were not on the menu) was essentially a shot of espresso, bourbon and a few spices.  It was the absolute opposite of sweet and I enjoyed it alone but when mixed with a bite of the tart it was even better.  \n\nShe got the cornbread pain perdu with bacon and pineapple caramel and buttermilk ice cream.  I wish I could make cornbread so melt in your mouth sweet and delicious.  It came with a 2009 Lambrusco Biano, Lini 910.  \n\nThis was more than a meal, it was an eating experience.  For us, probably a once a year at best experience because of the cost but well worth pinching pennies to insure that you can pull it off. \n\nIf you have considered visiting Craigie on Main but haven\'t yet I encourage you to save your money, eat in for a few weeks and make the trip.  You will not leave disappointed.']
["Craigie's 8-course tasting menu is heavy on the tasting (and $) and low on the taste, execution, and service.  The only good part was dessert, which was amazing.  Loved the beignets and lemon custard cake. My husband swore his semifreto was perfection but he coughed all over it before I could try it. \n\nWe ordered the 8-course tasting menu.  I went vegetarian; my husband and a friend went pescatarian.  To their credit, Craigie was was very accommodating about our dietary restrictions (albeit requiring 48 hours notice). \n\nPerhaps it was just an off-day. Or the fact that we ordered the tasting menu. Or maybe vegetarian and pescatarian alcohol-free fare is just not their thing. \n\nAll I can say though, is that if you're gonna charge over $100 bucks per person, you better be flawless in execution, taste, and especially service. \n\nI would give them one more chance because everyone loves them so much, but I'd probably order off their menu. If you are looking for a special occasion multi-course prix fixe, though, go to L'espalier instead."]
["Way too expensive for what it is. The waiters here are also very very slow and can get arrogant. If you don't look like you are about to drop $500 dollars here for two people, then they probably won't give much attention to your table. \n\nI guess the lesson in eating at Craigie on Main is : Dress like you make dough, and they'll provide the best service ever, but if you don't have any fancy pants, then please don't bother with Craigie, your night will most likely end up being empty glasses, long waits between courses, and an unattended table.  \n\nNonetheless, I have to give Craigie some credibility to its food, if they charge about 5 bucks a plate, I'll get it, yea, its' that good."]
["I wanted to treat my boyfriend to something special for his birthday and ultimately decided to surprise him with Cragie's 6-course tasting menu. \n\nAlthough the tasting menu puts a dent in one's wallet, it is a palate-opening experience that won't easily be forgotten. \n\nThe basket of Iggy's bread was full of my favorite rolls: A soft and spongy interior encapsulated by a hearty crust. I ate 2 rolls + a couple bites of the boyfriend's and had enough room to finish the tasting menu. We even asked for more rolls because they were so delicious! Since we couldn't finish them by the end of the meal, we asked to take them home but our server forgot and we were so caught up with savoring the incredible dessert beignets that we didn't realize we left bread-less :(. Noooo!\n\nOur Tasting Menu:\n\nSide note: I love that Cragie uses local ingredients! \n\nTrio of Amuse Bouche: Our favorite was the monkfish liver in a miso-mustard vinaigrette. Such a lightly smoky and unique flavor! I could eat an entire plate of this. Our second favorite was the smoked bluefish rillettes with hackelback caviar. The cured Scottish sea trout with charred jalepeño cream was ordinary to us. It tasted similar to smoked salmon but a bit more bland.\n\nSalad of Kona Kampachi Sashimi: Delicious fresh sashimi enhanced by the subtle flavors of whole pine nuts, pickled mustard seed, and sweet Asian pear. Wonderful!\n\nHouse-Made Whole Wheat Flour Garganelli Pasta with ham ragoût and forest mushrooms: Our least favorite. Too ordinary to be included in a tasting menu, in my opinion.\n\nButternut Squash Bisque with lobster, cock's combs, rye cavatelli, and Tennessee black truffle: I would say this had the most interesting concept. Personally, I wouldn't order this a second time, but I'm glad I got to try it because my tongue and brain were going insane with the flavor contrasts. Confusing, but in a good way.\n\nVermont Pork Three Ways: Suckling Confit, Spice-Crusted Rib, Smoked and Grilled Belly with Calville Blanc d'Hiver apple purée, turnips, port-soaked prunes, and maitake mushrooms: This was incredible. The belly and rib were outstanding and the dish had just the right amount of sweetness. \n\nGrilled Spanish Octopus: Omygoodness. An entire tentacle, grilled to tender perfection. \n\nOrange Blossom Beignets with date-orange caramel and cardamom anglaise. So Freaking Delicious. I loved the crunchy yet dainty cinnamon sugar exterior and how the date-orange caramel lightly oozed out of the beignet after each bite.\n\nBittersweet Chocolate Mousse Tart with smoked butterscotch and white chocolate-miso ice cream: Not a fan. Perhaps it was the miso? My personal preference? I wish we got a second order of the beignets instead.\n\nThe waitstaff was the best. Ever. Engaging, knowledgeable, fun, and attentive. The kitchen was very accommodating to my requests, as I had a pescatarian version of the tasting menu while my bf had the regular. Tony even came by to introduce our main courses to us while we of course stared in surprise and grinned stupidly the entire time. \n\nWe've already planned to sit at the bar next time and watch all the bustle in the kitchen. Until then, I will dream of delicious beignets..."]
["We had reservations at 8:30 on my birthday. We showed up early and hung out at the bar-- the young bartender who is an MIT alum (I don't remember his name) made us outstanding drinks and chatted with us for a bit. He even brought me a cocktail to my table once we sat down. \n\nI was a bit bummed that we were seated almost 30 minutes after our reservation time. I thought they were running a super tight ship! But the food was really, really good. There were a few things I'd tweak/improve, but overall worth the money. The steak was perfectly cooked. The portions are generous-- I'd venture say that nobody needs 3 courses here, honestly. Next time I'll share an app and dessert and then get my own entree.\n\nWe didn't feel rushed and the service was attentive. I'll come back when I'm feeling flush with cash, because this is definitely not a regular-Friday-night spot."]
["This review is for the 8-course tasting menu.  Bottom line- total disappointment and not worth it.  \n\nThe food is good, don't get me wrong; it just will not blow you out of the water.  There were a lot of fish preparations, e.g. kampachi w/ citrus vinaigrette and mustard seeds and pine nuts.  You can tell they're using fresh ingredients, but they dishes don't always come together well-- more like discrete fresh ingredients on the same plate.  I'll admit that the desserts are amazing: chocolate coffee semifreddo and lemon custard beignets, respectively.\n\nWhat was really disappointing, though, was the service.  It look amount 10 minutes after being seated to even be greeted by our waiter.  And each course is brought out by a different set of waiters who tell you about the dish-- gives the place a really chaotic feeling and a lack of personal attention.  We had to re-ask one of our waiters for extra bread, 10 minutes after he said he'd bring it out.  And surprisingly, they charged for each refill of soda, which you wouldn't expect at a place like this.\n\nThey were good about our vegetarian and pescetarian respective dietary restrictions (give them a 2-3 day heads up).  But for $118/person, I was expecting perfection, like you'd get at L'Espalier.  I think people seem to have better experience with the 3-course here.  The 8-course is out of place at this restaurant and they don't seem to have the service to be able to execute on it well."]
["The chef's whim is amazing. Delicious food, attentive service, fantastic drinks and great ambiance. The pork belly schnitzel was unbelievable."]
["One of the best meals I've ever had.  Our eight course tasting included:\n\nTrio of fish bites: smoked Scottish salmon with horseradish cream sprinkled with chives; pickled sardines; smoked fish spread of some sort topped with some caviar.\n\nTuna sashimi with pea coulis.  Good piece of fish in a very refreshing dish.\n\nTasmanian sea trout with tamarind sauce and garnish. Perfectly cooked and tasted/looked like salmon.\n\nSoft shell crab fried with squid ink aioli.  Some of the best aioli I've had despite its disturbingly black color.\n\nFusili pasta with duck ragout.  Hearty burnout too rich.  Loved it.\n\nLamb sausage patty topped with farm egg.  Like eating a hearty breakfast.\n\nRoasted squab with roasted mushrooms and bok choy.   The cherry and jus added perfectly to the gamely but lean and delicious squab.  Like duck but smaller and not as rich.\n\nWe also opted to add the bone marrow side as a supplement to our meal.  You get three HUGE bones with plenty of roasted marrow.  Delicious but was actually too much richness for me.\n\nPalate cleanser of rhubarb sorbet with crumbles and candied rhubarb.  Lovely.\n\nAffogato with spearmint ice cream.  I don't care for affogatos I'm general but the spearmint ice cream was delicious.  This was my dessert while my husband had...\n\n....a chocolate dessert with red beet sauce.  Very rich and chocolatey and the beet sauce actually went really well with the chocolate.\n\nPlum, hibiscus foamy shot for some thing post-dessert.  Was absolutely refreshing, balanced in flavor, and overall delicious.\n\nCheck came out with pecan pralines.  Sugary, rich and delicious since I don't care for pralines.\n\nEverything else was impeccable.  Decor was elegant in a casual, non-fussy way.  Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely friendly (there was always someone taking care of our drinks, removing plates, replacing silverware).  \n\nOverall this is the place for an excellent dining experience.  Don't need to say more than what everyone else has already raved about."]
['i heard Craigie was THE PLACE to get a tasting menu so that\'s just what we came for!! love the "home-ey" feel of the restaurant\n\nthe staff is SUPER professional &amp; observant of their patrons, they noticed us eye-ing the counter where you get front-row seats to the open kitchen, SO they asked if we wanted to be moved!! great experience.... they also made sure to only bring out the next course if both of us were sitting at the table!\n\nso why 3 stars? although some of the dishes were good, this tasting menu fell short of expectation compared to others i\'ve had in NYC.. i\'d probably stick to ordering a la carte here!\n\n6 course tasting menu (since they say the 8 course is A LOT of food), even the 6 course seemed like a lot due to all the freebies! \n---basket of fresh assorted iggy\'s bread!! like the sourdough rolls the best!!\n---amuse bouche: trio of seafood! salmon, razor clam w/ dashi sauce, &amp; pickled herring w/ beat puree\n---kompachi sashimi w/ asian pear, pickled mustard seed &amp; pine nut puree: not bad\n---monkfish w/ hoisin sauce &amp; chorizo plus chorizo oil: a very meaty fish w/ little flavor\n---house made whole wheat spaghetti w/ sea urchin &amp; mushroom: MMmmmm this was one of my fav dishes!\n---braised pork shank w/ quinoa &amp; cargine puree: the MAIN course to share! this was SUPER TENDER &amp; enjoyable... as was the quinoa!\n---apple sorbet w/ straciella cheese &amp; candied celery: (complimentary pre dessert palette cleanser) refreshing\n---(they gave each of us a different dessert) sour cream cheesecake w/ gingerbread foam &amp; candied orange .. this was a little underwhelming.. &amp; chocolate mousse w/ white chocolate miso ice cream ... i enjoyed this one much  more\n---toasted barley marshmallow over apple cider (on the house)\n\ni heard they only offer a limited number of burgers per night &amp; i didnt even see these on the menu so maybe i\'ll come back to try that!']
["Absolutely fantastic.  One of the best restaurants in the greater Boston area for sure.   Tony Maws definitely deserves the James Beard award for best New England chef.  \n\nThis restaurant is wonderful for celebrating special events for 2 or grabbing their absolutely fantastic burger at the bar.  If you want to sit at a table, I strongly encourage you to make a reservation early.  If you want to sit at the bar, then try showing up a few minutes before opening (depending on the day).  \n\nTheir menu changes daily and every single ingredient comes from local farms... every, single, one.  They are also big on being environmentally friendly, so they encourage deliveries of produce to the restaurant by bike, etc.   \n\nAlthough the menu is always changing, you can count on their delicious hamburger to be available and for at least one amazing pork dish (they really love pork).  Let me emphasize this hamburger: Craigie's hamburger is without question the most delicious hamburger I have ever eaten in my entire life.  I recommend trying it out sometime at the bar.  \n\nI've been here for the tasting menu, and it blew me away.  I had the ultimate/extreme/top-of-the-line tasting menu with my fiancee and we were amazed at the beautiful flavors we experienced.  I could not contain my excitement the entire night.  Every plate was perfectly prepared and lived up to expectations.  Even the desserts were fabulously tasty and unique, and I'm not a dessert person!  \n\nA note about the tasting menu: Craigie generally does not provide wine pairings for their tasting menus, so you will need to choose the wines yourself or ask your waiter for help.  This did not appear to be an issue for my fiancee who generally always has wine with her tasting menus.\n\n\nI haven't been to L'Esplalier or Menton yet, but Craigie definitely has beaten my experience at No. 9 Park (in case you were contemplating between the restaurants).\n\nDo your loved one a favor and take them to enjoy a tasting menu at Craigie.  Also do yourself a favor and add yourself to their mailing list so you can reserve a table for special events like the Mason-Dixon Line dinner (the James Beard best chef winner for the south east region will be cooking with Tony Maws)."]
["You don't need to see another four star review to know that Craigie is a classy, worthwhile establishment. BUT, having come to Craigie multiple times for brunch and dinner in the past few years, I can tell you that they are consistently good, and pretty much worth the money.\n\nTips: \n\nHighly recommend the chef's whim! If you don't already know, this is a 4 or 6-course meal based entirely on the chef's, well, whims. And that's totally fine, as you'll try things that you wouldn't normally order. For instance, my boyfriend laughed at me upon learning that I had eaten olives and *liked* them, even though I vehemently claim to dislike and avoid eating olives. So, live and learn! Although there are vegetarian and omnivore versions of the chef's whim noted on the restaurant website, they graciously catered to my preference for pescetarian dishes. The monkfish/shrimp/lobster entree was AMAZING. The pumpernickel breadcrumbs accompanying my chocolate bomb dessert with beet coulis were also a highlight. \n\nThere's a bar adjacent to the kitchen, and I also highly recommend calling them and making a reservation to specifically sit there. You can't do this through OpenTable. You basically get dinner and a show. Highly entertained.\n\nSo why four stars instead of five? \n\nWell, while I was highly entertained sitting at the counter during the chef's whim, it did occur to me that the dishes came out just a *little* too far apart. If I was sitting at a regular table, I could see the timing dampening one's experience. But maybe that's just time to imbibe more. Also, the steak and eggs option has disappeared at brunch. This is humanity's loss, really. Bring this dish back, Tony! Then you'll have yet another five star Yelp review."]
["Went here earlier in the year with high expectations because of all of the great reviews and James Beard awards. Thought we would catch the regular menu but because it was earlier in the day on Sunday, we ended up ordering from the brunch menu. \n\nI remember that I quite enjoyed the atmosphere and our server was nice. The bread was good (which I can't say for that many places anymore) \n\nGot fresh squeezed OJ and the forest mushroom and goat cheese quiche. Pretty good!\n\nLoved Boston and would visit here again to taste a differnt menu!"]
["I had high expectations for this place, but found it in every way disappointing.\n\nWe went for the Chef's whim on Sunday evening, which is a tasting menu of small dishes. Prior to arrival, they must've called me 5 times to ensure we were going and to clarify allergies. Then, when we arrived, we had to repeat the allergies answer at the table. What was the point of asking over the phone via 3 phone calls then?\n\nThe service was quite slow. We had a reservation but still had to wait before being seated. Once seated, we were not brought any water or bread till 10 minutes later. Once we ordered, we waited at least 30 minutes before the first dish was served. \n\nThe portions of the food are TINY. While I think the food was good, there really wasn't enough to make a proper judgment. You literally were served a bite of anything. While the Chef's whim is theoretically good value, with such little food, we weren't quite sure. I honestly think the lines of the menu describing the dish took more effort than the food.\n\nThe wine list was decent but quite expensive. The cheapest bottle was $50, which is sold for $20 in retail shops. \n\nWhile we had a good time through ordering 2 bottles of wine, the food wasn't really up to our expectations at all."]
["Summary: Chef's Whim during Restaurant Week was a nice treat for our anniversary dinner at a reasonable price, but only 2 of the 5 dishes were standouts... fun to try, but not planning to go back again :P\n\nOur friend recommended we try to catch the Chef's Whim dinner while we were in town to celebrate our anniversary in Spring. Since it was Restaurant Week, we were able to make a reservation for a Thursday night at 9:30 pm, but the Chef's Whim is usually only on Sundays, I think. It was REALLY late for us to be eating dinner, but our schedule was bonkers anyways, since we were jetlagged a bit from traveling.\n\nWe arrived a little early and were seated right away. However, the service was a bit spotty as throughout the evening we found our eyes rolling about the restaurant trying to locate our server and waiting for what would come next. We went with the 6-course menu, but in hindsight, we were so stuffed by the time we hit the 5th course with some courses being rather mediocre that I don't think it's a huge step up to go 6 over 4. For moderate eaters like me, I would just go with the 4-course menu so you can thoroughly savor and enjoy each course and not be SUPER stuffed by the end of the night.\n\nDefinitely appreciated how they were trying to tailor their courses to their diners... newbies seemed to be getting the specials while repeat customers looked to be getting some other dishes, but it actually made me a little sad thinking that maybe we weren't getting special treatment and might be missing out on something stellar someone else received. I appreciate the concept of a slow meaningful meal, but there were points at which we were waiting 30-40 minutes between finishing the last bite of one course and starting the next one. It made the flow of our dinner a bit choppy, since we wavered between excitement at seeing what would come next and grumpiness that we were having to wait for so long to see what it would be.\n\nThat said, there were a few highlights among the variety of food we enjoyed.\nGOOD:\nAmuse bouche - poached &amp; chilled Maine mussel over funnel cream (something light and savory to get the meal going)\n1st - sashimi kona kampachi on sesame seeds/citrus coulis with mustard seeds\n2nd [BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT!] - slow-roased monkfish with curred spinach, split pea puree and crab &amp; maine shrimp - some of the freshest and impeccably well-cooked seafood I ever had... the firm texture and surprisingly harmonious flavors were perfection itself. It was all downhill from that apex of fine dining.\nMEH (everything else):\n3rd - asparagus over golden raisins with a poached egg\n4th - chicken. It wasn't that memorable.\n5th - Meyer lemon sorbet with candied Meyer lemon peel\n6th - Dessert (Orange blossom beignet with orange marmalade &amp; creme anglais / Spearmint affogato)\n\nMaybe it was the late hour. Maybe it was the packed house. The 2nd course was the absolute star, so it was disappointing for the rest of the meal to not live up to that early highlight. I wouldn't give the main dining room another try, BUT I'm very intrigued by all the hype about the burger at the bar. It was highly recommended by our server."]
["I wish i could just move into the kitchen here and take a bite from every table-bound plate.  I've had the 4, 6, and 8 course tasting menus and each is a beautifully orchestrated symphony for the senses.\nThe food grows progressively warmer and richer with each course.  Favorites from my last visit were octopus with truffle oil (part of a cold/raw opening trio), sturgeon with pea shoots (3rd), and lamb belly bacon and sausage (5th, final savory).  The bone marrow (served in pretty good sized femurs) is a must have, although it's easy for me to fill up quickly spreading this on bread.  With the pacing of courses, I'm close to done at around 5.  It's hard to resist splurging on 8 courses for fear of missing more amazing creations, but that bit of restraint means I can enjoy the velvety ice cream at the end of the meal (though I wouldn't mind swapping it for bone marrow).\nThere's an excellent selection of local beer and ales but also fun cocktails that blend citrus and chilis and bitters.  I usually prefer wine or beer, but Craigie is one of the few places where I really enjoy sipping a spicy, icy mixed drink."]
["We didn't end up eating here. The girl at the front who assigned tables was very haughty and seemed to care little about politeness and decency. However amazing the food may be, it would have been difficult for us to enjoy our meals (on our anniversary, no less) with such poor service. Fortunately, there were/are plenty of other restaurants for us to choose from in the area, many of which have polite service along with their excellent food."]
["There is really not much more to say about a place that's been reviewed by everyone and their mother. I've had the pleasure of dining at Craigie twice in my life. Both times I have visited I did the 6 course tasting menu. \n\nThe great thing about the tasting menu is that it isn't set in stone. The chefs do an amazing job picking 6 dishes that will make your mouth water. If there is something you want on the menu, you can ask that they put it in the tasting. The first visit, I had to try the pig's tails and they showed up! They were amazing, of course. My most recent visit, we made sure the trio of pork was included as well. \n\nI love the confidence they show when you trust them to put together your entire meal without you knowing what you will be eating ahead of time. To be honest, I could not tell you exactly what my 6 courses were, but I can tell you the fish was all mouth watering, the pork was brilliant, and the desserts were gone very, very quickly.\n\nThe servers definitely know their stuff. While your main server might not be the one to drop off each course, whoever does will tell you in full detail what you are about to enjoy. The cocktails are great, the wine selection is above average. The decor and open kitchen is an amazing concept. I'm definitely going to try and grab a seat that looks directly into the kitchen next time I visit."]
["I have been here 4 times now. This last time was for their annual whole hog event. There is a set tasting menu that really uses the whole pig. There was not one course that I didn't like nor was scared to try.  The service was not the best that night at first. The BEST part was the manager recognized there was an issue, worked hard personally to make it better for us and really went the extra steps to make the whole evening great. Taking those extra steps makes me want to go back again and again."]
['This place is great!  The service is exceptional.  I sat at the bar and both bartenders were friendly, professional and quite knowledgeable.  \n\nI ordered a few starters.  The octopus was tender and  prepared perfect.  The fried pig tails stole the show.  With a dish like that on the menu it better be great.  They knocked it out of the park.  \n\nIn addition, after I asked the waiter if there was a pork belly appetizer when there was only pork belly as an entree; he surprised me with a complimentary small dish of seared pork belly.  The impromptu dish was crispy in the outside and tender and juicy in the inside.  I would like to thank the chef and staff for that delectable treat.\n\nA must go.  I will definitely be back.']
['My wife and I came for our 14th anniversary. As we were seated, my wife noted that she was cold, a shawl was offered by the staff during the dinner. Very nice touch! \nService was most very good, except when we arrived. It took 15minutes for our server to come by. \n\nWe ended up having the eight course tasting menu. \nOur evening started with a set of drinks - a strawberry puree, lemon, Chambord, and champagne.

['After a celebration dinner I was neither disappointed or blown away by Craigie\'s. I\'m sad that I didn\'t have the mind blowing experience that so many others seemed to enjoy.\n\nFirst, our service was spot on. From the hostess to the server, we were treated wonderfully.\n\nFor our appetizer we had the brussels sprouts and a pasta dish. I can\'t remember much about the pasta dish because it was actually quite bland. Not much seasoning or taste. The brussels were great though!\n\nFor our entrees we had veal two ways and the cod. When the dishes came out we were surprised to see that our meals looked almost identical. The only difference was the protein on the top. They both had the same foam on top and the same accompanyments on the bottom. My cod was cooked amazingly. It was light, flaky and other restaurants could learn something from whoever cooked this fish. Not much flavor with my dish, but the fish was excellent. My date said the veal was "ok". :( For $35+ for the dish I was hoping for more than "ok". \n\nSince we weren\'t really wowed by our meals we decided to skip dessert. We left with a $130 bill and a sense of disappointment.']
['CoM-600.\n\nLet\'s get two things straight:\n\n1. CoM is the best restaurant in Boston, period. It\'s a Michelin star waiting to happen. Ask the locals who come at 9 pm on a Sunday for the special 4-course menu. Ask the chefs on their feet from 10 am to midnight, in constant creative motion. They come to work for and to stand tall with the best. \n\n2. You can possibly have the greatest meal of your life here, if you do it right. And for most of you, "doing it right" will be harder than you think. But if you\'re up for it, then keeping reading.\n\n(a) Come alone. \n\nYes, alone. No distractions from the food and the chefs in the beehive of an open kitchen. No wives, no boyfriends, no anniversaries or birthdays or promotions. No special occasions or people whatsoever. \n\nIt\'s got to be just you and the food. Nothing and no one can get in the way, not even the ones you love.\n\n(b) Ask for one of the four seats at the chef\'s counter, which look directly into the kitchen and allow you to see, hear, and sometimes even talk to the chefs. Your gaze is at them, not at the other 95 or so diners and 30 staff who make this place run to feverish perfection. The 3:1 ratio, by the way, is one of the secrets here. That\'s serious attention to every little detail possible.\n\n(c) No matter what, always order the 8-course tasting menu. And no matter the cost, always go with the white and red wine recommended pairings. This will cost you around $250 (including the 20% tip). That\'s the price you will pay for greatness.\n\n(d) Eat slowly. Use your hands if necessary (it will be). Do not let a single trace of food served to you go back to the kitchen. Sop up the sauce with the bread. Eat each and every last piece of bread in your basket, including the crumbs. Do not let a single morsel go to waste. These are gifts given freely, not cheaply. Do not under any circumstances turn them away. \n\n(e) Think about texture and not just taste. Imagine that each course is a museum of art masterpiece and you are walking from one gallery to the next. Except in this museum, the paintings come to you, and not the other way around:\n\n(i) Chilled Maine mussels with essence of fennel, a kiss of the sea, and discs of red radish;\n(ii) Kona Kampachi (ocean-ranched Almaco jack) sashimi with Asian pear and baby red shiso leaf - delicate pieces of the Pacific from half a world away;\n(iii) Tasmanian sea trout filet slow cooked with chorizo oil, pimenton, and chives - red smoke and pink flesh and yellow oil all melting and merging into one;\n(iv) Seared scallop with peekytoe crab and polenta - crunch, crust, crustacean, corn.\n(v) Whole wheat pappardelle with duck hearts and wild foraged mushrooms - the deep and dark tastes of a New England forest floor in the leafy throes of mid-autumn;\n(vi) Veal sweetbreads (the hypothalamus, in this case, not the thymus) with a roasted parsnip glaze reminiscent of light maple - would that all brains were so delicious;\n(vii) Venison in rare loin medallions and in sausage casing, with chestnuts and quince - hoof, antler, fruit, nut, tree. \n(sorbet course) candied celery and green apple - a cleansing cool rush of chlorophyll;\n(viii) Pumpkin cheesecake with gingerbread foam and orange - sophisticated sweetness in grandma\'s old-fashioned spiced form.\n\nWines - Chenin Blanc, Loire valley; St. Joseph, Northern Rhône (100% Syrah). \n\nSometimes I say to people who review on Yelp to focus on the experience, not just on the food.  But here, it\'s different. The food and the experience, they are one in the same, locked in a passionate embrace that you cannot escape, because you won\'t want to. \n\nBut the food *is* your companion that night: your date, your friend, your lover, your secret affair; if you want it to be the best, you must leave behind all the rest. \n\nWhile there are many reasons to come here, if you truly love great food and genuinely admire the chefs who create it, then there is only one initial option. For the culinary crusader, CoM must first be done solo, or it can never be done at all.']
["My boyfriend took me to this restaurant for my birthday and we had an excellent time. Everything - the service, food, wine, and drinks were impeccable. The only dish I did not like was the duck ragout which the restaurant was testing. If you are not a fan of gamey meat, I would suggest opting for the vegetarian alternative, which I believe was ragout with wild mushrooms, instead. My boyfriend received that dish with his tasting menu and it was sooo good. Compared to Journeyman, another great restaurant with a tasting menu, Craigie on Main's portions are larger and more filling. My boyfriend and I each had the 6 course tasting menu and we were both stuffed by the end of the night. There is also a very cute bar area for after dinner drinks. I can't wait to go back again!"]
["Tucked away on a quiet street in Central Square, is Craigie on Main,  one of the hottest, new restaurants in Boston.  This organic, head-to-tail restaurant serves French fare, using farm-fresh, local ingredients.\n\nSnag a seat at the dark, romantic yet casual bar, where the full menu is served.  You will be entertained by Craigie on Main's sharply-dressed, dexterous bartenders who craft old classics, attested by the small bottles of house-made infusions and bitters that line the bar.\n\nLike a mad scientist, our bartender poured, tasted and stirred two cocktails at a time, doling out Northern Lights ($11) with St. Germain, Scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki; and Ardoise ($11) with Rain, sage, juniper, and lime.\n\nStart with an appetizer of crispy fried pigs' tails ($17), sprinkled with pickled peanuts and pungent, sweet nc chm.  It tastes like the adopted baby of Susur Lee and Jacques Pépin--distinctly South Asian but rich and very decadent.\n\nFried onion rings on top? Yeah, that would be Jacques' idea, too.  Maybe I watched too many Looney Tunes episodes as a kid, but I thought pigs had coiled tails. Who's will open my wine now?\n\nI originally came for the milk-fed confit baby pig's head for two, but alas, a nor'easter prevented a proper delivery.  The pied de cochon Farci for two ($64) however, did not disappoint.  Enjoy a craft cocktail or two, as this pig's foot takes a full 45 minutes to prepare.\n\nWhen it arrives, it is a glorious, glistening trotter that is de-boned and stuffed with its own lush, succulent meat, wrapped in pork belly.  Jacques would be so proud.  Beautiful cross-sections of pork are soft, custard-like and gelatinous.  Served on a bed of creamy potatoes and kasha, sweetened with a mix of chestnuts, pioppini mushrooms and parsnip purée, it is a mosaic of flavors and colors."]
["Came here for brunch, and I'm glad we did. First of all, my bloody mary was PHENOMENAL. Like, it was hands down the best one I've ever had (and um, that actually means a lot). So spicy, so fresh!\n\nOther highlights: the biscuits that came with my crepinettes, the rhubarb panna cotta with cashew and cardamom granola. Surprisingly, I wasn't *that* blown away by the burger, which is supposed to be amazing. Oh well. Definitely pricey, but worth it for the drinks and desserts alone."]
["I like Craigie, I really do, but I'm not an adventurous eater. If I was I would probably be more okay with paying $18 (salads and apps) to $38 (entrees, $43 for steak) on a special occasion. Considering some of my only options are chicken (38) and salad ($18) and my boyfriend makes better chicken, pass. That being said, when I'm in the mood for a burger ($18- only at the bar area) I come here. I'm always in the mood for their Corpse Reviver #2, best one in the city. If you're looking for an excellent meal in Cambridge without the Craigie sticker shock (well as much), I recommend Puritan and Co., Helmand, and Hungry Mother."]
['Disappointing meal overall. Not enough flavor in any of the dishes we tried. My tomato appetizer included over-ripened tomatoes. Chicken entree seemed undercooked. Extremely over-priced for the dishes served. Pleasant atmosphere.']
['Amazing experience. We tried the 6 course chef menu and were not disappointed. Everything was unique and delicious.  Servers were very good. We will be back.']
["The pig's head for two is incredible. The bone marrow appetizer and pig tails are both incredible. Craigie on Main is incredible."]
['Not that they need another 5 star review or anything, I think its probably pretty well known at this point that Craigie is arguably the best restaurant experience in Boston.  \n\nHere are the facts:\nI\'ve been to dinner here 8 times strong and I can literally say that every meal was better than the last.  If there\'s anything in the world any restaurant would want its customers to say it\'s that statement right there.  \n\nChalk that up to a half dozen 6-course tasting menu extravaganzas (highly recommend this at the chef\'s table), a chef\'s whim dinner on a Sunday night, and a "hey lets just order some food" on another occasion.  \n\nI would break up the act of eating into a couple categories:\n\n1. I\'m hungry, therefore I eat food.  \n2. I\'m hungry, but I don\'t want just anything.\n3. I\'m hungry and want a transformative experience through the act of nourishing my body.\n\nYou go to Craigie if you\'re seeking #3.  \nIf you want a simple sashimi of dayboat scallops to give you goosebumps.\nIf you think there\'s something inherently awesome about Chestnut Flour pasta tossed with a pig\'s foot ragout.\nIf you want food that you can rave about for the rest of your life...dude, seriously to this day that "tongue &amp; cheek" dish at my second 6-course was borderline life affirming.\n\nBut like anything great in life: moderation people.  Its a good thing I don\'t live in the area because I\'d be miserably obese and broke.']
['From the food to the cocktails, everything here was exquisitely crafted and made from scratch. Even the ketchup and the pickles for the burgers! The Craigie burger is definitely a highlight and worth getting there early to eat. The pigtails were another (surprisingly) delicious dish.\n\nWhile pricey, if you want a fine dining experience with creative cuisine, Craigie on Main would be it.']
["I had been to Craigie on Main once before, a couple of years ago, when T &amp; I were in the midst of becoming sick. Neither of us had happy memories of this dinner, as we were both in a sickness-induced fog of miserableness. I never had any interest in returning to this restaurant, but when I set out to visit each of the highest rated #-Z restaurants in Boston, I realized Craigie on Main would be mandated to be re-visited. We headed over with minimal expectations...and we were blown away by the experience.\n\nLocated between the Central and Kendall/MIT T stops, Craigie on Main is also car-friendly, with some street-parking as well as valet available. An interesting mix of local seasonal New England cuisine with French techniques, Craigie on Main has moved towards the top of my Boston-area favorites.\n\nWe arrived (a bit late) for our reservation, and were told that there was a recent cancellation for the chef's counter, and were asked if we would like to sneak on in. We snatched the opportunity to peek into the kitchen, and plopped ourselves front and center.\n\nThe whole restaurant is focused on the open kitchen, which is a nice change, but does create a bit of a bustle for those that don't have front-row seats like we did. Fortunately, there are many mirrors placed throughout the dining room so diners are able to see bits and pieces of the cooking.\n\nEvery night the menu may change, but there are always prix fix menus along with tasting menus of 6- or 8-courses available. T and I went with the prix fix as we had our eyes on certain items already. After ordering, we were surprised with one amuse bouche each, for T, a mussel, and for me, a beef heart pastrami with spicy mustard.  \n\nAs an appetizer, T went with the house-made farro flour spaccatelli with wild boar and forest mushroom ragoût. T reported this was very savory, and I stole a piece of the spaccatelli which I can report was very rich &amp; tasty. I went with the grilled Spanish octopus with grilled cipollini onion, green olive &amp; lemon salad, bulgur wheat, and chorizo purée. Soft, delicate, and delicious, this was the perfect light appetizer. We were also amazed by how large our appetizers were.\n\nFor entrees, I chose the slow roasted chicken breast (since I love restaurant chicken so much) with chicken sausage, dried apricots, forest mushrooms, spring-dug carrots, and a scotch whisky jus. This is the dish that single-handedly blew me away. This chicken has undoubtedly moved to the top of my Boston-restaurant-chicken list...a hard list to even get near. Moist, tender, and flavorful, the combinations on the plate were unbelievable.  \n\nTravis went with the Vermont pork three ways: suckling confit, spice crusted rib, smoked &amp; grilled belly with russett apple purée, turnips, port-soaked pruned, and maitake mushrooms. The confit melted in his mouth while the rib was crispy and moist. The grilled belly reportedly paired well with the mushrooms. We also split a side of duck-fat roasted brussel sprouts, which were fresh, crispy &amp; scrumptous. \n\nAs T was stuffed and out of commission for dessert, I took control and ordered for us (....me, really). I have always loved anything malted, and the moment I read those four little letters on the menu (m-a-l-t) it was decided. We got the malted milk parfait, with honey roasted peanuts &amp; a chocolate sorbet. I allowed T to have 2 bites, but then after tasting this dish, I hoarded it for myself. This dessert is easily in my top-2 desserts in Boston. Unbelievably tasty, the contrasting textures harmonized into an amazing flavorful bite. Bits of chocolate brownie, a small almost peanut-buttery-caramel textured bit, with crunchy pieces resembling cocoa crispies and the salty honey roasted peanuts...I was in food-heaven after bite one. \n\nWe will most definitely be back to Craigie on Main. I now have the Chef's Whim's tasting menu on my to-visit list. Every Sunday after 9pm, chef Tony Maws will cook up a discounted 4- or 6-course tasting menu on a whim.\n\nPictures and more on -- ----"]
['Yelp said, "Woohoo! As good as it gets!" and I agree!\n\nMy two friends and I came here to celebrate a friend\'s new job. It was late on a Friday before we even decided to go out but were quickly sat at 10p. This place was still bustling. The open kitchen, I\'m sure, creates a great visual show for those in the dining room. The Bar is a little more low-key. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive. Some other people refer to the service as being spotty but for us, it was not the case. We did the 6 course tasting menu: A trio of amuse bouche\'s (various fish preparations), ahi tuna and pork belly over celery root puree, fish course, pasta in a lamb sausage ragout, and pork prepared three ways. We also got the two side offerings: a sauté of summer vegetables and bone marrow and a palate cleanser before the desert course. The food, the service, the drinks all made this my favorite Boston dining experience thus far! Well done!']
['"Ummmm...so what does this pig\'s head for two look like?"\n\n"Well, it is half of a pig\'s head that is slow roasted for about 45 minutes. The cheeks are the best part and really the more you get into this dish and the more open you are with it the better it tastes and the more you eat! It is honestly our best dish we offer."\n\nSo Matt J. and I were bold and ordered this bad boy and yes, it really was a head. It is served Asian style with little pancake type things and some hoisin sauce and some toppings so as you slice away at the cheek and ear and the skin you get to make little wraps which actually made it easier for me to eat. Matt however was having a field day with it! His eyes were all aglow just like a 5 year old on Christmas morning! I didn\'t want to order it, but the look of his face even at the idea of it was simply priceless.\n\nAnd boy were we full. That crunchy skin from the slow roasting is pretty awesome I do have to say. I think those should be turned into chips or something because it is addicting. Overall a fatty dish since it is well, you know, a pig\'s head, and I actually was fine with it until we got to its eye socket and saw its teeth! Yup, it was all there. But we asked our waiter where the tongue was and he said he had never thought about that and honestly had no idea why it wasn\'t eaten....hmmm...There is food for thought!\n\nThis dish was definitely a unique experience you can\'t get very many other places. Our service at the beginning of our meal was pretty slow and it took quite a long time for our drinks, but Matt\'s mom\'s steak was the most tender delicious thing ever. The sashimi appetizer was just so so though and the rabbit porchette honestly was not the most amazing thing either even though our waiter definitely hyped that up as well. \n\nSo come here and be bold and get the pig\'s head and bring your camera. Then you can gross out all of your friends via facebook with a pic of those teeth like Matt did ha ha And hey, people back in the day used to eat every part of an animal, so at least we got back to our roots in our food adventure!']
['I\'ve been meaning to write a review about Craigie for awhile, as it is maybe my favorite restaurant in the Boston area.  Over the past year, I\'ve been there maybe 10 times.  Most of the times I\'ve gone, I\'ve had some version of the tasting menu, which are always different each time, thoughtful, creative, and with high quality seasonal ingredients.  If you do the tasting menu on all nights (except Sunday), you\'re paying over $100, depending on how many courses.  I know that is expensive, but to me it is worth every penny.  Execution of the food, the timing, and the flavor profiles are always an experience each time.  \n\nBut if you want a less expensive tasting menu with the same type of quality, go on a Sunday night at 9PM on, and there you can get a 6-course tasting menu for $57 (!!) called the Chef\'s Whim.  It is the best deal in the Boston area by far for the quality of food you\'re getting and what you\'re paying for.  The idea stemmed from the Craigie Street Bistro days where before the end of their work week, they would have quality ingredients left over, but not enough to make large portions or put anything permanent on the menu, due to the seasonality and availability of the ingredients.  Essentially, you\'re getting creative preparations with high end ingredients for a fraction of what you might be paying during the week.  \n\nThis restaurant easily has great ever-changing menu items.  Of course, the pig\'s head and the hamburger are stellar standouts, already written by a lot of people.  But to me, Craigie is a place where the best experience is when you submit your tastes to the will of the kitchen, and eat whatever they give you because you will be surprised each time.  Like I said, I\'ve eaten there close to 10 times over the past year, and it\'s been great each time.  You get the same quality of food you\'d get at the best of Boston restaurants (No. 9 Park, L\'Espalier, etc) but in a less formal setting and in most cases, less expensive.  \n\nIn terms of service, I\'ve always had amazing servers, bartenders, managers, etc.  Everyone was courteous, quite personable and knowledgeable about the menu and drinks.  The servers were always willing to give suggestions depending on your taste.  If there\'s any wine you\'re unsure about, you\'ll always get a taste of it first, even at the table.  Normally this happens when you\'re at the bar, but they do this readily at the table.  It\'s something small, but definitely makes you feel like the server\'s out for your best interests.  \n\nTheir bar program mirrors the mission of the kitchen.  They can make you any cocktail, but the menu focuses on creative craft cocktails.  This is not a beer garden, so no 20+ beers on tap.  They have a rotating selection of 4-6 beers on draft and a large selection of hard-to-find bottled brews.  The same with wines.  I\'m not the biggest fan of white wines, but the sommelier at Craigie has certainly changed that.  I\'m one of the many Americans that\'s caught up with the whiskey craze, and they have an impressive collection of scotch (including several Japanese whiskeys), bourbons, and rye whiskeys.  That being said, if you\'re a bourbon cocktail fan, go for the Mellow Yellow or the Golden Fizz.\n\nAnd they will remember you if you go there more than once a year (i.e. chef\'s whim Sun nights).  After I had been there only a couple times, they were throwing an extra course or amuse-bouche during my meal.  They appreciate regulars, and I think it\'s easier now more than ever to be a regular, and not just because of the chef\'s whim.  They recently started a late night bar menu which begins around 10 PM.  This usually ends up being 5-6 dishes at $6 each.  You put 2-4 of these dishes together, and you pretty much have a complete meal.  Like the chef\'s whim, this will not be average bar bites and will depend on what\'s available and fresh that day.  Menu items have included "shroom and eggs" (whatever wild fresh mushrooms paired with a fried egg...simple but delicious), pate and toast, smoked bone marrow (when available), and duck tenders.  They\'ve also had various grilled octopus parts.  One night I went for the late night menu, they had an oyster/caviar dish.  I thought it would be fresh oysters topped with salmon roe or tobiko.  Instead, I got 2 fresh Duxbury oysters topped with foam and Beluga caviar...for $6 (Beluga caviar option usually goes for at least $30 in other restaurants). The menu is written on a small chalk board at the bar usually around 9:30ish, and it has 1-2 word description of each item, but you\'ll be getting much more than just that.  \n\nThe brunch here is pretty f***ing phenomenal too, but this review is already too long.\n\nSo go to this restaurant as soon as you can.  If you\'re tight on $$, go around 10 PM and grab some late night menu items for $6 a piece...or if you\'re willing to splurge a little, go for Brunch or better yet, go on a Sunday night after 9 PM for the chef\'s whim.']
['We went for brunch here, and wow what a fantastic experience.  The service is impeccable, it is obvious that this place is very professionally run.  Two hostesses, two expediters, many many waitstaff, and the place was packed.\n\nWe had a special cocktail made with Pisco, a Chilean grappa-like brandy.  Very cool and inventive and tasty.  I had the tongue n cheek hash.  It was delicate and tender, and had some nice microgreens on top.  Just perfect.']
["Overall, I was disappointed with Craigie; I found most of the dishes to be pretty dramatically overseasoned and somewhat underwhelming.  Service was very slow with over a 30 minute wait for some of our plates.  Here's what I remember from the meal:\n\nCrispy fried pig's tails with pickled peanuts, nuoc cham, and cilantro - This dish was fine but not memorable.  The vegetables in particular were lackluster.\n\nPotato and radish green vichyssoise with glazed veal sweetbreads, ramp kimchee, and paprika oil - This dish was too salty and had a very off aftertaste.  The sweetbreads were fine.\n\nVermont pork three ways - suckling confit, spice crusted rib, grilled belly with turnips, pickled cherries, pistachio butter - Being the restaurant's speciality, this dish was unsurprisingly the best of the night.  It's a lot of meat, but if you love pork, you are in for a treat.  \n\nSirloin steak with oxtail pastrami, forked potatoes, fava leaves, and crispy ginger-shallot salad - The steak was well cooked, but I found the accompaniments to be merely okay.\n\nMalted milk parfait with roasted peanuts, chocolate sorbet - This dessert was way too sweet and really had no complexity to it.  It needed something to contrast with the sweetness of all the components.\n\nAt the end of the day, I thought Craigie didn't live up to the hype."]
["Overall, I would say this place is easily rank top 5 in boston. The pig head is dreamy! It's labeled for 2 but it's enough for 4! You eat it as Peking duck style with the meat wrapped inside the pancake. The sauce is just right, creamy and not too salty. The meat is moist and juicy and the skin is crispy. I can't wait to get the dish again!\nWe also ordered the squid ink paste and pig tail. Delicious! Paste cook al dente and buttery and topped with clam and croutons. Perfect combo! The pig tail, oh the pig tail...I am still drooling now. I mean I am Chinese, well if you hadn't known from my last name. And I haven't had as good of a tail as this one. Well, maybe the one from Drink on congress st is a close call. It's crispy and yet falling of the bone. Just like the pig head!\nMy only complain is the price. The apps are 18 and entrees 38. So pig head is 76. That's half head. If I go to Chinatown, I could get a whole baby pig for like less than 200."]
['(This review is for the bar only.)\n\nIn an era when people rate their drinks by the obscurity not quality of the ingredients, and when it is perceived as fashionable for bars to be located in hard-to-find back alleys staffed by poor souls in 1920s costumes, Craigie is an island of stable excellence. Though the place is obviously food-focused, their bar has a large selection of interesting cocktails and great wines by the glass. I had a couple of whiskey drinks, including one really stellar one (Continental Relic) based on peat monster scotch. And while the hordes were waiting for hours to get into the bars down the street, we had no trouble getting a seat for two immediately at 9pm on a Friday night. Objectively excellent, and definitely the best place in Central for drinks and a nice conversation.']
["I'm really SO  SORRY not to be able to write a glowing review. This was our second visit hoping to recapture the initial amazing experience. This time we decided  to forgo the tasting menu for the slow cooked swordfish for two. The waiter made it sound so tasty and it was a good match with the slowed cooked beans but the SALT spoiled the final taste. I know that salting things is the latest rage everywhere but you spoiled this wonderful dish with too much salt. :-("]
['Upon moving up to Boston last year, Craigie on Main quickly became one of those places I really wanted to try, thanks in part to the combined praises of James Beard and Yelp. Unfortunately, there was the issue of "when." Reservations here aren\'t always easy to come by, particularly for a party of five seeking a weekend date between 6 and 8 pm. The solution if you\'re in my shoes is, of course, to plan ahead (like a month or more ahead). Trust me, it\'s worth it.\n\nCraigie did not disappoint: everything was pretty darn outstanding. To start, the ambiance is great. The staff is serious about the food (and drink), but not stuffy, and the restaurant has a laid back, slightly hipster but not obnoxiously so, feel. It\'s modern, yet comfortable; upscale, but down-to-earth--if this makes any sense at all, the restaurant feels "real." There\'s also an open kitchen... if you can snag the chef\'s table, do it.\n\nLibations-wise, the wine and spirit menus are both nicely assembled. I started out my evening with a glass of the house-made fortified wine, which was oh so delicious--not too sweet, with a lovely citrus note. Meanwhile, others in my party had a grand old time with the wine list, which included many nicely priced options and unexpected finds.\n\nIf you\'re into the "snout-to-tail" style of dining, Craigie\'s is definitely for you. That being said, there are also plenty of options if you\'re like me and tend to stick with tamer fare. For an appetizer, I went with the pumpkin soup, which I enjoyed greatly, though others at my table commented that they found the curry flavor to be a bit strong. The soup also came with a small grilled cheese sandwich, which was deliciously buttery--the two cheeses had that perfect amount of tang you expect a good grilled cheese to have, without being too sharp. Others at my table very much enjoyed the octopus, which they deemed to be well-prepared and what I believe was a smoked trout? salad (I\'m afraid at this point I was so absorbed in my fortified wine that I did a less-than-admirable job of paying attention to other dishes around me).\n\nFrom the pumpkin soup, I moved onto the slow-roasted chicken breast, in further testament to the fact that you really don\'t need to have an interest in consuming a pig\'s head to enjoy Craigie\'s (but go ahead and enjoy it if that\'s you\'re thing--it\'s the place for that too). This might have been my favorite dish on the night. Somehow it had the lovely tenderness of sous vide chicken, but the superior taste and texture of roast chicken. In addition to the chicken itself, the plate as a whole was well put together: the carrot puree and apricots added a subtle sweetness, which beautifully complemented the savory chicken and earthiness of the mushrooms. Others at my table enjoyed the tautog and the pork three ways a great deal, as well as the side of marrow bones.\n\nBy this point in the meal I was debating whether or not I really needed dessert, but then the dessert menu came and the decision was made for me... the malted milk parfait sounded too good to pass up. And it was: the chocolate cake, the malted milk ice cream, and the saltiness of the peanuts (to cut all that sweetness) left me a very happy, albeit full, camper. My table also tried the affogato, which was simply delicious, and the trio of sorbets, where the concord grape was a surprising stand out.\n\nOverall, this was an excellent experience... if you\'re into food, I really can\'t recommend Craigie\'s enough.']
['The experience I had at Craigie on Main isn\'t for a weak stomach. I mean this in two ways--beware, I\'m going to get detailed. We ate some of the more adventurous items on the menu. And if you\'re the type who can\'t handle too spicy or acidic (acid reflux), too greasy or creamy (diarrhea), or too much meat (MORE diarrhea), then you\'re like me.\n\nAnyway, Craigie on Main gets a 3.8 from me: the food was good but some of the dishes we ordered were similar to dishes in cheaper Asian restaurants, the experience was memorable and recommendable, and the aftermath was...also memorable. The service was great and our waiter was amazing. That being said, I think we could have gotten a very different dining experience with different menu choices. Craigie on Main deserves a repeat.\n\nWe ordered pork ragout, pig tails, the shared pig\'s head, a praline-nougat dessert, and vanilla saffron pudding. I also had 2 cocktails (the Serius, a delicious lemon/ginger/vodka concoction) and my boyfriend had a beer. We ordered the pig head right off the bat as it takes a bit longer than most of their entrees.\n\nFirst, the food. The bread was decent; it was a nice sourdough, but it was being served from the basket next to the computer. My boyfriend wanted his bread straight from the oven--nitpicky, but, as he pointed out, the amount we paid might justify something like this. For the amuse bouche, we received what I believe was beef heart pastrami with a touch of mustard underneath. It was sliced thinly and was surprisingly tender. Definitely a great first impression for my first experience with heart!\n\nThe food was pretty much perfectly executed. The pig tails were perfectly seasoned, delicious, and very Vietnamese-inspired. There were onions (I think) lightly breaded and fried on top, cilantro, and thinly sliced jalapenos. The pigtails were, as the server said, basically (delicious, tender, collagen-y) chicken wings except with pork. With the exception of the onions on top, however, I think you could walk into an Asian restaurant and get a similar dish of equal tastiness, except with slapdash presentation and a less pleasant environment. The pork ragout topped with a farm egg was great--a much lighter appetizer than the pig tails, but one that really showcased the talent of Craigie\'s kitchen.\n\nThat leaves us with the pig head. It was a delicious mess and an incredibly fun thing to do, if not to eat. For the faint of heart, it does get kind of gross to look at the fuller you get. I recommend the experience at least once. Taste wise, again, very Asian inspired. Barbarically ripping chunks off the skull, placing them in a Peking pancake with a smear of boudin noir/hoison sauce and a bouquet of sambal...I had a few critiques, some of which might have to do with my skill in choosing what parts of the head to eat.\n\nTips based off impressions: Avoid the fat for the sake of your gall bladder and because although it will initially be delicious, it gets really disgusting biting into a mushy pocket of fat as you start getting fuller. Fight your partner over the cheek muscle. Don\'t put too much boudin noir sauce on. I found a little went a LONG way--it was very rich, and you could taste the graininess and pastiness the blood introduced into the sauce. I actually thought a slightly more acidic sauce would have been better; this one was a touch too creamy. The sambal was DELICIOUS and did add some acidity, but had a very strong flavor on its own that would have overpowered the other "burrito" components if there was too much. It had bean sprouts, which I thought I hated, but I found myself cleansing my palate with fistfuls of the stuff. I do not recommend the ear (had a weird musty smell to it) and the pupil of the eyeball (yes, it\'s there. Weird texture).\n\nLastly, desserts were a surprise delight. I love praline and nougat, and this dessert was perfection. The vanilla/saffron pudding was also great, and we received teeny, tasty macarons while paying the $200+ check.\n\nThen came Wilbur\'s revenge. Even on the 40 minute ride home I felt my gall bladder furiously squirting/cramping and wondered what the heck was happening down there. I was pretty much stuck on the toilet for the rest of the evening and periodically the following day. Fighting for the toilet in a 1 bedroom apartment with your significant other is not fun. My thought was it was caused by too much fat, too much meat--hence, not for weak stomachs. But I don\'t regret it at all! Go to Craigie!']
['I\'m ambivalent about this restaurant.  It\'s charming and a nice scene.  The waitstaff were pleasant, efficient and well informed.  They paced the meal beautifully and we enjoyed interacting with them.  One major issue is that our party of four was seated at a bar height table, with tall chairs.  This may be OK for a drink, but it\'s not OK for a restaurant that takes itself seriously.  I guess we should have objected to being seated there.  It was an uncomfortable way to spend two hours.  Management should consider this seriously.  We were served excellent bread upon being seated.  The bread basket was refilled cheerfully.  The cocktails were very good.  Wine was OK.  The menu was a bit challenging- this is not the place for a picky eater to go.  Appetizers were excellent.  I had some of the best fried clams ever.   A friend ordered the fried pig\'s tails.  They tasted like spare ribs.  My wife had a pasta appetizer that was very good.  Entrees were not as excellent.  My wife had the mullet, which she didn\'t love.  I had the pork three ways.  The rib and the confit were excellent.  The pork belly was OK.  Dessert was really disappointing.  The desserts were all avant garde/deconstructed/intellectual/challenging dishes.  We uniformly hated them.  I had "banana bread bread pudding", which tasted like something that may have been freeze dried and served to astronauts during the 1970\'s.  My wife had deconstructed carrot cake that was the rare carrot cake that she didn\'t like.  It was accompanied by goat cheese ice cream  that could only be described as heinous. \n\nThe uncomfortable table and unpalatable desserts were disappointing.  The service and appetizers were excellent and the entrees were good over all.  This meal wasn\'t worth the price.   Under other circumstances, I could see it being a better experience.  For $250 per couple, including tip, it didn\'t deliver.']
["The Biff took me here for my birthday/part of a bet (The Biff should not make sports bets. Period.). And boy am I glad that he did. \n\nApparently he reserved a seat at the chef's table/ burger bar thing, but I guess they forgot. We got seated at a high-top near the actual bar.\n\nDRINKS: Hate to say it, but really not memorable. They were fine, but not nearly as great as industry guys and people on Yelp claim. Maybe it was the bartender's birthday too and he took the day off....\n\nMENU:\nAssiette of Housemade Terrines: I REEEALLY REEEALLY like eating fluffy rabbits. There was a rabbit pate and I was not disappointed. It was like a super-fancy charcuterie and I enjoyed myself.\n\nSquid: Biff ordered this. I remember liking it, but not as much as the terrines.\n\nBone Marrow: The first time that the Biff ate bone marrow. He loved it, and frankly it's amongst the best I've eaten as well. They split it down the middle before roasting it, making it not only easier to eat, but it was also cooked so evenly.\n\nSuckling Pig's Head: JESUS MARY and JOSEPH, this was so amazing and fatty and weirdly cute, but equally sad. This little pig went straight into my stomach and I loved every minute of it. Came with some tortillas and garnishes, certainly needed more than they provided considering it was an entire effing head, but wow, seriously, wow.\n\n\nDid we have cake? Maybe. Probably. Looks like it wasn't good enough to write home about.\n\nI gotta bring The Biff back for the burger."]
['Really enjoyed this place. It was on a quiet street in Cambridge; valet is $12. The inside was very cool and pleasant place to dine with different shaped mirrors hung on exposed brick; the dining room was roomier than I expected from the few photos I had seen. A nice buzz in the restaurant, but not too over the top. We splurged for the 8 course tasting menu, and it was very good. Greg our waiter provided great, knowledgeable service without being too in your face. Our favorites were: kampachi sashimi, sea trout, veal cheek, lamb chops. Pork belly was so-so. Our desserts were fantastic - dark chocolate Marquis and a Japanese tangerine flavored cake. Would return again.']
['Update - We were able to return to Craigie on Main for a second visit and I must say that the second time around was much, much, better.\n\nOnce again the service is definitely excellent (we didn\'t have an issue with the service the 1st time,  it was good then as well).  Greg, our waiter,  was very personable and had a very good method of checking in,  while not being intrusive.  He was knowledgable on all the food items and did a great job.\n\nThe cocktail i tried was very interesting, in a good way. It was some sort of agave/tequila based drink,  with a very smokey flavor. I would recommend it,  although it\'s very different from anything else.\n\nFor our starters,  we had the friend pigs tails and the asparagus (a new dish).  The fried pig tails were very flavorful, hot (yay) and had a very interesting flavor from the peanut sauce.\n\nThe asparagus dish wasn\'t quite as delicious,  but was still good.   The asparagus themselves were very very fresh however. \n\nAs our reservation was at 5:30,  we were quick to point out we would like one of the burgers,  which Greg put on "hold" for us.  They did not disappoint and were quite delicious, along with the home made ketchup and fries.\n\nFor a desert, we had some excellent local cheese and then were treated to some spiced hot chocolate.\n\nAll in all, a much better experience the 2nd time around which leads me believe that our first experience was perhaps a fluke.\n\nKudos to Craigie on Main management for reaching out and making things right, I\'m glad we were able to return and enjoy a nice dinner here.  Maybe we will try the brunch next!']
["Been here twice for brunch and both occasions were great in overall experience.\n\nI'll speak to my latest visit:\n\nArrived at noon on Saturday at noon just after the new years without reservations and had no problem getting a table for 4.  Our waiter was friendly and patient with us as we chatted and took our time ordering.\n\nFood:\nPork belly: I've had this before and I thought the first time the fat was more tender.  Still enjoyed.\n\nBeef Cheek and Hash - my brother got this dish and though I'm not much of a beef eater it was a pretty tasty dish.  He finished the dish with no complaints, mopping up the gravy/juices with bread.  Whenever anyone is mopping up anything with bread, that's always a sign of a good dish.\n\nGrilled cheese and pork sandwich with an egg on top - anything with an egg on it is good food.  This was my dish and like my brother I was mopping up the runny yolk with anything that was remotely spongey.    \n\nHouse cured ham and forest mushroom gravy - the heaviest of the dishes but full of flavor.  We couldn't see the ham at first but its cut into small pieces and mixed with what I thought was grits but the menu says its gold rice.  The grits/rice were full of the ham flavor.\n\nSpicy Bloody Mary - Perfection.  I'm a stickler for a good bloody mary and this hit the spot.\n\nGreat place and looking forward to trying dinner."]
["I was really disappointed after my boyfriend and I spent an evening for dinner for my birthday here this past Saturday. \n\nWhile we were waiting to be seated, the hostess brought us over to the bar and told us a waitstaff would come over to take our order of drinks.  After waiting through 10 minutes of their staff ignoring us, we finally had our order in. However, as soon as the drinks were made, and we saw them made, no one brought us our drinks. 10 minutes later, when someone had realized there were drinks sitting behind the bar with no customers to drink them, they walked around the entire area asking people if they had ordered drinks, finally asking us last. When I got my drink, my glass felt very sticky and dirty.  \n\nThe food was a major disappointment. Our bread came in a basket burnt, hard, and cold. I wondering why the bread was wrapped in a blanket to start with. I think, the best part of our dishes were the starters, the pig tails, pate bread, but our entree (I got the black bass, and my boyfriend got sirloin) was completely unappealing! My fish was cold and drenched in curry. The sirloin, on the other hand, was a very mediocre sirloin. And then, the dessert came. We, or my boyfriend, had told them that it was my birthday. They came out with my dessert, and then in a cup was a candle.  \n\nWe left both disappointing and confused in our meal and the service. Was this an off night where everything was Asian fusion, when this place was suppose to be a French/American place? Maybe we just didn't understand the food? Is that even possible? \n\nLater looking at the Facebook page, I found a post offering for pre-ordering cake for a special occasion(\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151955639619383&amp;set=a.129645909382.103308.43420979382&amp;type=1&amp;relevant_count=1). I asked my boyfriend if he was notified of this or not, and he said he was offered that option."]
["Definitely pricey but everything we had was delicious.  Drinks, food, service... all excellent (until dessert... I didn't enjoy this course as much but it was just because I wasn't into their choices for me as much).  We did the 6 course tasting and it really was fresh and great!  Service is always a highlight."]
["One of the best meals I've ever had. Sunday brunch crowd was not too busy, service awesome and the hash with eggs was fabulous."]
['I took my husband here for his birthday solely to get one of the "hidden" hamburgers. They only serve 25 per night and only in the bar. Make sense they are a high-end restaurant. They don\'t want to be know for hamburgers.\n\nWe did start with the octopus appetizer. I had never had octopus and it was very good. The texture was a bit strange but it was good. The burger was amazing though. Full of flavor, a lot of food and you can add bacon. What more can you ask for?  They also have homemade ketchup! Delicious!!\n\nI would love to go back with a foodie friend and try the dining room. I need to save a bit first though!']
['Best burger in Boston hands down!!! Outstanding service and extensive wine list as well! You have to sit in the bar to get the burger, but it is just as lovely as the main dining room. Love this place!!!!']
['4.5 stars.\n\nHusband and I arrived at Craigie well in advance of the rest of our party of five and happily pulled up two stools at the bar to enjoy some cocktails while we waited.  If I were to describe Craigie\'s carefully crafted and thoughtfully composed cocktail menu, it would be, "wowee wow wow."  Over the course of our several hours here we sampled the Flower Sour (bourbon, Cardamaro, lemon, honey and lavender); Never Setter (Szechuan Plymoth, maple, lemon, Barolo Chinato); Northern Lights (St. Germain, scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki Bitters); Civilian (Mezcal, orange, lime, date molasses, Thai chile); Root Down (Salers Gentiane, barrel-aged genever, sour orange, Gran Classico); and Ardoise (sage, Rain, juniper, lime).  The last time I was this over the moon about cocktails was more than a year ago at Salt of the Earth in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe other bonus of spending time at the bar was chatting with local Bostonians celebrating the start of the weekend and learning about Craigie\'s top-secret, off-menu hamburger.  "They only make like, 18 a night," the Lilly Pulitzer-clad debutante next to me whispered breathlessly.  "Once they\'re gone, they\'re gone.  Trust me: YOU WANT ONE."  Actually, I didn\'t want one; I came for the simply irresistible, best whole-roasted chicken Alex Guarnaschelli ever ate.  But it turned out FIL and our friend did and -- once we were seated in our plush booth in the bar area -- ordered them from our server.  "You\'re in luck!" she whispered as breathlessly as debutante.  "There are only three left!"\n\nOnce the rest of our party showed up, we were seated at our booth.  I was worried about the potential noise level in the bar, but the hostess informed us there\'s no standing allowed in Craigie\'s bar.  Noise really was kept to a minimum and, frankly, our booth seemed to be one of the more comfortable tables in the entire restaurant, with interesting views into Cambridge outside.  It seems we inadvertently scored one of the better tables in the house.\n\nSince there were five of us, we decided we could probably sample our way through much of the menu à la carte.  Each course was beautifully plated and impeccably prepared.  Every bite was elevated by the fact that Craigie sources its food from local farmers and growers, meaning its meats are all-natural, free-range, and humanely raised.\n\nBefore we even started servers were setting amuse bouches before us: Sardine Fritters for the ladies, Beef Heart Carpaccio for the boys.  Appetizers soon followed: Ricotta Cavatelli with Mushroom and Boudin ragoût, Grilled Spanish Octopus with Cipollini Onions, Bluefin Sashimi with Onion-Shiso Salsa, and Crispy Fried Pigs\' Tails.  The cavatelli was rich and chewy, the octopus as tender as a cloud, sashimi buttery soft, and the pigs\' tails an extraordinarily crunchy and unctuous treat.  \n\nFor entrées FIL and friend ordered those famous burgers, which arrived accompanied by some of the thickest, crispiest fries I\'ve ever seen, as well as house made pickles, ketchup and celeraic roulade.  SIL ordered the hangar steak which had great flavor but was unfortunately a touch dry.  Husband and I eagerly requested the Misty Knoll Farms whole-roasted chicken with apricot, chanterelles, and whiskey jus.  A runner presented us with the entire bird tableside before it was carved; after we\'d ogled its golden hue and plumpness, it was whisked away for plating.  It was, if I do say so myself, the runaway best of the entrées -- including that burger which was good, but didn\'t impress like we\'d expected.  The chicken however was succulent and moist, served atop a subtly sweet apricot purée and earthy mushrooms.  We devoured every bite, and husband even set to work on the carcass, which is also presented if you so desire ("Really, it\'s some of the best meat," our server confided).  I couldn\'t bring myself to pick at a structure of bones, tho...\n\nFor dessert, a sorbet trio of Blackberry, Raspberry, and Yogurt (my favorite of the three for its tartness); Coconut Ice Cream with pumpernickel tuille; espressos for the lame, er, I mean, responsible; and an Islay Smokey Peat Scotch for me.  \n\nCraigie\'s is a fabulous find in Beantown.  I\'d come back for the cocktails alone.\n\n[15 Minutes of Fame: "The Best Thing I Ever Ate: Simply Irresistible" (Alex Guarnaschelli, Misty Knoll whole-roasted chicken)]']
["Best meal in the Boston area. My husband and I come here a few times a year, and the food and service is consistently excellent. He always gets the Vermont pork-3-ways dish. It is unbelievably good. I got the swordfish this time, and it gave the other dish a run for its money! Incredible flavors, melts in your mouth. It's one of those meals that you spend the following months trying to top but can't. And that's what ends up drawing you back here. Even though we were one of the very last tables of the night (it was a 10pm reservation), we never felt rushed. The waitstaff--Thadius and Natalie--were friendly and professional. We look forward to our next meal here."]
["To be completely honest, I am doing this review for myself. If one can't decide they should visit Craigie on Main prior to reading my review, they shouldn't go. I will try not to borrow from other reviews and just simply give the best representation of my overall experience. \n\nI am a fairly serious foodie and have eaten at great restaurants across the SE. On my first real trip to Boston for business, naturally I gravitated to Yelp for restaurant picks. This one stuck out from the get go. The story, pedigree, reviews...all signs pointed to greatness. I didn't make it here until my last night but I am so glad I did. \n\nMy friend and I walked in at 9:30 on a Tuesday night without reservation and were promptly seated. The place was moderately busy, about what I expected. Neither of us were hungry enough to do the tasting menu but I'll save that for another day. We decided on the prie fixe menu. Everything looked great but amazingly, the first course options spoke to me a bit more than the entrees. \n\nWhen the waiter gave us the two side specials of the night which included brussels sprouts roasted in duck fat and roasted bone marrow with grilled toast, I knew what I'd be having. I went with the grilled spanish octopus, fried maine clams, and the latter two sides. My friend had a pasta dish with mushrooms and sausage. I can't do any of these items justice. \n\nThe grilled octopus was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I actually went to Spain earlier this year; this killed anything I had there. The clams were breaded and fried nicely, with what I recall to be a squid ink cream sauce. Not the standout but solid. The bone marrow was an experience to be had. It had an aroma that can't be replicated with an unparalleled mouthfeel. The  brussels sprouts were as good as a one could ever expect. I could eat that as a side daily for the rest of my life. My friend thoroughly enjoyed their pasta dish and from the bit I sampled, it had a very pleasant flavor and texture. \n\nLook...I didn't even mention the good cocktail I had or the decent wine. This place isn't about that. If you consider yourself a legitimate foodie and you are ever in Boston for dinner, do yourself a favor and make it to Craigie's. I know I will be back for the tasting menu one day. Also, the service was impeccable. I could not find one thing to criticize the restaurant for. I even think it offers value. \n\nJust go."]
["Went there on a hot Friday evening at 5:30 pm. The A/C couldn't keep up and it was fairly warm inside. Service was attentive, but the pacing of the meal was strange. The appetizers came out quickly then there was a wait of more than 30 minutes for the main dishes. They kept stocking the breadbasket so the four of us filled up on way more white bread than anyone should eat.\n\nEverything was good but not commensurate with the prices. I would say that the whole experience was on a par with Henrietta's Table at the Charles Hotel, which is dramatically cheaper and a lot more functional. Maybe I was spoiled by going to O Ya earlier in the week."]
["My boyfriend really wanted a Craigie burger for his birthday so I made an early reservation in the bar. I also pre-ordered a special occasion cake from the pastry chef in honor of the event. We were seated at a high top table in the bar. Our pre-dinner cocktails were delicious. I had the Serius which was a delicious adult lemonade. We started with oysters for an appetizer which were great. We both ordered the Craigie burger with bacon and egg. It deserves all the hype. It was cooked perfectly and it was delicious. Everything from the meat to the house made roll. My only critique is that I didn't love the mace ketchup. The chocolate and coffee cake I ordered for dessert was also delicious. There was a bit of a hiccup with the cake getting to our table but the more than made up for it with there excellent customer service. We will come again."]
["Craigie On Main is 5 stars for food, but there's only one reason keeping me from giving it the final star.\n\nI brought my boyfriend here for his birthday, and had the 10 course tasting menu prepared for us (mm, delicioso!). He loved the food, but the poor boy was miserable the whole time. We sat at a table where I sat on the booth, but he had a chair. That chair was positioned in between three tables! The servers, patrons, and hosts were ALL kicking his seat during our 3 hour meal!\n\nOut of all the courses that we had, my least favorite was the plum sorbet...that was kind of...gross. But all in all, Craigie On Main is on point.\n\nAlso, if you're wondering about dress code...just don't wear sweatpants and you're all set. I felt a bit overdressed with my plain black dress and heels. It wasn't even that dressy...but compared to the family wearing a t-shirt and jeans, I was dressed like the Queen."]
["Been back on numerous non occasion and tried for the first time last night the veal sweetbread with cock's comb mushroom ragout topped with an egg.  Yes, I said cock's comb.  That little funny thingamajig on top of a rooster.  Has a very chewy ligament like texture to it but taste oh so luscious.  The egg-y chewy mixture were out of this world!  \n\nI might just head back tonight to order just that and a glass of ardoise (a light refreshing juniper libation), the menu seems to change on certain nights (which fascinate me).  We also had the marinated grilled swordfish, it was tender and moist... very unlike swordfish behavior but our server swears by it.\n\nMmmm... can't wait for more cock's comb."]
["Yummy pig tail. Three words I can say because I went to this place once.\n\nI can't remember anything else I ate."]
['Unfortunately our experience at Craige On Main was mainly negative compared to our experiences at other expensive restaurants  in the Boston area.   Some background...we are a middle aged couple, came in in a great mood ready for a great meal.\n\nOn the pro side, our table was waiting for us when we arrived about 10 minutes late due to no parking spaces nearby, the sous waiters were quite good, the food came to the table in a great rhythm and the bread and butter were fabulous....BUT:\n\nOur main waitress was loud, condescending, not very observant and either not well informed about the food, or in too much of a hurry to answer our questions.   At her first appearance at our table she presented the option of the tasting menu ($98, 6 courses) as if only cheapskates and people that don\'t appreciate fine dining would order anything else.  The prix fixe menu ($67, 3 courses)was presented as a poor second choice. And it wasn\'t until we asked if there was a way to order a-la-carte (since we don\'t usually eat desserts)  that she directed us to the tiny print below the prix fixe menu that indicated  that one could order any appetizer on the prix fixe menu for $18 (even for a salad) and/or entree for $38 (+$5 for the steak).  But, she made it really clear that only dolts would order a la carte.  Then over the next 10 minutes as my husband and I were obviously perusing the menu(eg holding it up and eyeing it), deciding what to order, she proceeded to come over to our table no less than 6 times...each time asking in a loud, cutting voice "Are you ready to order, YET".  It was said in a way that made it clear we were inconveniencing her by not being ready to order.  Since we had come in at 8:30 as an early last seating we couldn\'t figure out why she felt the need to rush us.  When we were ready to order and asked her about how dishes were prepared she didn\'t seem to have a clue.  The best she could do was tell me that the bass had a red butter sauce (no idea why it was red, but evidently not tomatoes) and that the cod had cream in it (but no it wasn\'t a cream sauce).   \n\nUnfortunately, for us, the food did not make up at all for service that approached on rude.  The fried clam appetizer  was OK.  I didn\'t like it, but my husband did. And my husband described his octopus appetizer as rubbery and tasteless.  The entrees were similarly uneven.  My husband got the pork 3 ways...one way was a extremely fatty cut, another way was something that resembled and tasted like a small piece of ham(I think pig\'s ear) and a third way was one nice tasting rib (a little less tasty than what we had had at a friend\'s bar-b-que the week before).  My stripped bass was probably the best dish, very well cooked, a tasty sauce, and the one piece of walnut that was on this dish tasted heavenly with the sauce and fish....too bad they couldn\'t have spared a second walnut piece to go with it.  The check with 1 beer, 1 cocktail and 1 glass of  of their most inexpensive  ($14) red wines came to about $185 with tip.  And yes because we have worked in the food industry we did tip the waitress 20% anyway.\n\nWe won\'t be going back.  We found the service pretentious, approaching on rude ..without the food to back it up. Maybe the food is better if you get the tasting menu, but at close to $300 per couple, if you have drinks, we are not willing to take that risk. I have to wonder if opening a new restaurant is taking too much of Tony Maws time and attention away from Craige on Main.\n\nPS.. If the check had been a bit cheaper I might have given Craige 2 stars....however in my book, you shouldn\'t charge top dollar and deliver this kind of experience ever.']
["There's not one bad thing to say about this place. I went at 530 (when they open) on a saturday night and was lucky enough to get a seat at the bar. My bf has been wanting to try a burger here for years now and it did not disappoint. The burger is a good size and the outside is peppered and has a good crust on it. The bun was very good too, fresh and solid - which is important. There are few things worse  than a bun that falls apart mid burger. \nWhile we did only have burgers, the next day my bf and I both agreed that we'll be going back for a special occasion to try the tasting menu."]
["The Milk-Fed Pig's Head was sublime, as was the Spanish Octopus and wine choices. Nice selection of vegetarian options also. Warm, cozy space and great staff. I took a group 6, was perfect."]
["Literally the only time in my life I have had to send food back to the kitchen (oysters).  I'm a man so I normally bear the consequences of poor food selection with the silent shame that society demands, but in this case I only managed to get down two oysters before I gagged and was forced to admit defeat.  The waitress was gracious enough to remove them from the bill, but I felt the judgment and disappointment radiating from the young lady sitting across the table from me.  I don't know how I'll ever be able to tell our kids what those oysters did to me.  How does one even make oysters taste bad?  Our pork belly was good, but I truly don't think one can make bacon fat taste like anything other than happiness.  I give them two stars instead of one because they had aquardiente on the menu, but I will say that in my opinion, this is the most overrated restaurant I have eaten at in Boston."]
["Great food, great service, and great experience! I really enjoyed my meal here- so many nice courses. I took advantage of Natalya's wonderful suggestions and had a great evening."]
["It's so nondescript on the outside. You could seriously walk past chatting loudly about the latest Kristen Stewart drama without a hint of the delicious surprise that awaits if you were to walk in the doors. Well, your loss.\n\nWe booked a 6pm table on Saturday and were seated promptly to my favorite table in any restaurant, the back corner, while the place was still relatively empty (As to why it's my favorite, the back corner is usually the most quiet table, you have more privacy, but you get a view of the whole restaurant). Server was very knowledgeable and after quickly (easily?) deciding on the 6-course tasting menu, we embarked on a truly memorable culinary adventure.\n\nThe set menu was masterfully composed and uniquely diverse. From fish with yuzu to heart ragout to perfectly cooked venison, the courses were ordered (as they should be) from delicate to strong on flavors and were inventive, interesting and most importantly, well balanced and delicious. As an avid fan and proponent of offal (it's really good when understood and cooked well and brings new flavors and textures you wouldn't get otherwise, plus it's humane), I loved the incorporation of lesser used ingredients. To top it off, Tony Maws was kind enough to stop by us random diners and talk about the farm in Texas where he sourced the Sika venison we were at the time vigorously noshing on.\n\nAfter quickly wrapping up the bill, my (now fiancee) and I walked out with wide smiles and wider bellies (although the portioning was actually done well) and vowed to come back again when our wallets allowed. At their next nose to tail event mayhaps?\n\nBravo"]
["I'm no professional foodie, but this restaurant has been on my list for over a year.\n\nWe finally decided to celebrate and luxuriate in Cragie's top tier tasting menu. Sure, there were a couple things I didn't love, but far more commonly I found myself enjoying an ingredient I had never tried or thought I disliked.\n\nI'll admit to being a little intimidated by the place, mostly due to its reputation and my ignorance of haute cuisine. Our waiter immediately put us at ease and at least knew enough to pretend to be entertained by our ignorance and enthusiasm.\n\nThe one word that we'll always associate with COM is fun. Occasionally whimsical dishes, a friendly staff and a special but unstuffy atmosphere makes for an incredibly fun dining experience."]
["We've lived in Boston for about 5 years. This was the best meal my wife and I have had in the city."]
['Central Square doesn\'t have a tremendous amount of culinary delight to choose from. While Craigie on Main is definitely in its top tier, it\'s not the most AMAZING food I\'ve ever had. It\'s very good but not "5 star" good.\n\nTo be honest, I don\'t remember all the nitty-gritty details of the meal so here\'s what I do remember:\n\n- We ate WAY too much bread. The bread is tasty but its also extremely filling. By the time we had our entree, I could barely eat another bite of food for fear of bursting. I actually looked up how much food the human stomach can handle before bursting. It\'s about 4,000 cc\'s. While some people have eaten significantly more without exploding, I don\'t recommend trying. Apparently, you will die of sepsis. It\'s not pretty or quick; it\'s supposedly pretty agonizing. \n\nAnyway, back to the review...\n\n- We ordered the Crispy-Fried Pig\'s Tails and Grilled Spanish Octopus as starters. I ordered the Octopus and wasn\'t particularly impressed. This is a tricky dish to get right. Like scallops, if it\'s overcooked, it loses all its delicious texture and flavor. These were probably just a bit overdone. Sadly, they had little flavor. \n\nI was a bit reluctant to try to Pig\'s Tails but my BF knows his food so I was more willing than usual. As he went to cut me a piece, there was no meat to be eaten...it was just a giant hunk of fat. Eventually, he was able to find a piece that was more meat than fat. It was tasty but again, not mind blowing. \n\n- For our entree, we ordered the Whole Roasted Misty Knolls Chicken. When they say "whole" they mean it\'s the entire chicken. And although it says "For Two" in parentheses, it\'s really enough to feed 4 people who also ordered appetizers. Was it delicious? Completely. But was it worth spending $70 on it? Not really. We were so full that we could barely eat more than a few bites. We wound up taking it home but had dinner plans most of the coming week and wound up tossing the majority of it. It was utterly painful to toss more than half of a $70 chicken. \n\nFinally, the restaurant gives you a complementary dish before your official meal begins. Honestly, I don\'t even remember what it was. All I know is that I wouldn\'t have ordered a starter had I known how much food was coming our way. \n\nGranted, I haven\'t tried their burger (which they\'re known for). I will definitely go back since the food is really good but I\'ll skip the bread and starters so I can actually enjoy my entree!']
["If I looked in the mirror I'd probably be dressed like a Dallas Cowboy's Cheerleader. But I'm not, I assure you, there's just far too much surface area to wax in order to get into one of those outfits. But enough about me, let's talk about burgers. \n\nOh yes, juicy, delightful, drop dead succulent knock you into a primal red meat trance state burger. That's what we had tonight, but before I get to that, let me cover other ground. \n\nFirst of all Tom, hat's off to you, you were a true alchemist behind the bar and served up some treats. 1919 might be my new favorite drink and was a perfect spot of sweet desert before we left the joint. I'm going to order that once more.\n\nIn terms of gastronomical goodies... oh jesus the, the pig tail, we had to order a second portion of it it was so bloody good. I'm lying here in bed and getting hot and bothered thinking about those lightly meated bones of sweet joy with the jalapenos. Madre Dios!\n\nDid I mention the pig parts? The octopus was one of the most tender tendrils I've ever tasted. The appetizer feast continued with small balls of joy made from ground goat and the potato something or other was a standing ovation. \n\nNow I'm finally ready to talk burgers... you see there are grilled meat patties and then there are burgers. But there's a third category I'd label as Burger with the capital B and that's where Craigie's burger belongs. Until this point in my short life I believe that the Hungry Cat in LA had the best piece of grilled ground meat I'd ever run across. Hang on to your hats kiddies because out here on Beantown they gots something great. Yeah, you don't get this Burger if you want two pieces of bread and a hunk of meat, you get it because you understand that fine beef should be rare, crying and mooing when you bite down on it, and that the juice that dribbles down your chin should be bloody. If you get that, then you're ready for Craigie's burger, otherwise there's plenty of other delights on that menu... but this is a serious burger for the aficionado that thinks they've had it all. \n\nI'll be back in 3 weeks... I'm counting the days and the airline miles in between... *sigh*"]
["Plenty of people have waxed poetic, so I will keep this short, but hopefully helpful. The food was very good (pork three ways, and chicken for the entrees). The service was great (thanks to Monica for recommending the pork and to Thaddeus for the cocktail advice -- the improved whiskey cocktail is great for old fashioned fans). But was really stood out were the small touches. Best example: I told them that dairy food generally doesn't like me, so when they brought the bread and butter to our table, I was given a small dish of olive oil for my bread. It was a thoughtful touch."]
["When you want a burger or a whole pig's head, come here.  \n\nTheir burgers are blended with bone marrow, so they are incredibly juicy and flavorful.  They even make their own house ketchup for the fries.  Unless you're going to go with the tasting menu or one of the crazy options like a whole pigs head for 2, get the burger (and add bacon).  You'll love it.\n\nStart with some great cocktails like Jupiter's Acorn and share the trio of terrines (goat, pig, and duck).  AWESOME!"]
["Definitely a mistake to come here for a third dinner of the evening. The mistakes were 1) eating 3 dinners in the same night which led to 2) insufficient space in my belly for more food here. Even on a weds night at almost 10 PM the place was packed. A restaurant in Boston open till 1AM on a weekday? Major plus. The decor is minimalist but warm and cozy. All the staff were very attentive.\n\nWe made it for the late night menu:\n- Bread - 3 varieties, all decent but not memorable\n- Terrine - I love jiggly meat, period. The presentation was beautiful and most items were very good. Wish that the plate came with little crostini rather than big toasted bread which was a bit unwieldy for the delicate terrines. \n- Bacon cheeseburger - A perfect medium rare, juicy, flavorful, bacon was not overwhelming - a very superior burger but does not touch Sel de la Terre's. Bland salad, average frites.\n\nI was somewhat dismayed that my first meal here could not be the 10 course tasting menu. Having missed out on this experience, I can only say that my impression of the food was about a 4, but  with the service and overall experience put it right up there. I can't wait to come back for the full on experience, next time I'll be prepared with empty stomach and stretchy pants.\n\n***UPDATE***\nFull tasting menu - Decent, not great - Odd progression, 1 outstanding course, 1 that I didn't want to eat after 2 bites, and most others I enjoyed but were ultimately forgettable. Service was strangely overbearing yet unaccommodating. Win some, lose some."]
['The service here is phenomenal.\n\nWe made a reservation two weeks ahead on a Saturday and we only were able to get 9:30pm. We arrived promptly but unfortunately we still had to wait until 10pm, at which point they asked us if we wanted to be seated at the Chef\'s bar, which we did not mind at all (it was like watching an episode of top chef). Once we were seated, complimentary sample drinks and appetizers were brought to us to "make up" for the wait time and the table at which we were seated. Both the hostess and our server were extremely pleasant and gracious. \n\nUnfortunately, I had forgotten that their famous grass-fed beef burger was a bar menu only (and the bars don\'t take reservations). According to our server, people start lining up for the bar at 5 for their burgers and they often run out. So if you are interested in having that burger, you should keep it in mind.\n\nLast time I was here, I had the pig\'s head, which was...interesting.\nThis time around, we decided to play it safe and we ordered the Sea Bass and the Veal two ways, both of which were marvelous.\n\nHonestly, there\'s not much more to be said for a restaurant that does everything perfectly. I\'m really glad I had my last meal in Boston here. \n\nJust go.']
["I'm from California, so I've been having a hard time adjusting to quality of food in boston. This restaurant is the best food I've had in boston and also one of the best meals I've had in a very long time. We did the 8 course tasting menu and it was a lot of food, but every single dish was cooked to perfection. the goat cheese ice cream was my favorite."]
["Since my last review, I've also eaten from the bar, and done brunch, the Cocktail Whim, the 6-course Chef's Whim and the 10-course tasting menu. All equally fantastic, all equally expectations-exceeding. It is absolutely amazing how well Craigie consistently combines incredible service with mind-blowing food in an intimate, cozy, elegant setting. I heart Tony Maws &amp; Co.\n\nP.S. The Chef's Whim is the best deal around. The perfect way to experience Tony's culinary genius. But don't be fooled by the late time--definitely make reservations! \n\nP.S.S. If you are a cocktail fiend like me, the Cocktail Whim is just plain awesome-ness. Four tasty, delicious, unique creations served in the cutest glassware I almost stole, challenging the palate in incredible ways.\n\nP.S.S.S. I think the best value dining experience is still the 6-course tasting menu (first impressions are lasting impressions and all that). No, but seriously, the reason is that it's obviously cheaper than the 10-course but they stretch it out to technically 9 courses because dessert consists of 3 courses instead of just 1. Fellas, do the 6-course tasting menu for your ladies' special occasion and I guarantee she'll still be thanking you a long time afterward."]
['One of the worst brunch experiences I\'ve had in years.  My boyfriend and I visited Craigie on Main for brunch yesterday morning.  It was very busy, but we considered ourselves lucky for snagging two seats at the bar for brunch.  Not so much.  The bartender provided a horrible customer service experience.  We were invisible to this man.  I had to get up and walk to the other side of the bar to ask for anything (water, the check, drinks he forgot about).  He spent most of the time looking at himself in the mirror behind the bar and obsessively shaking bloody Mary mix for minutes.  I\'m not kidding.  It was crazy.  I kept looking at my boyfriend like, "Are we on candid camera?"  Now keep this in mind when I make my next comment: I am happy to pay more for smaller portions of good quality food.  I prefer to do that honestly.  However, the serving sizes at Craigie are absurd.  I ordered the 6.00 yogurt to start and was given a Dixie cup portion of yogurt with a few cashews on top.  It was insulting for the price.  The polenta dish was admittedly good, however, not even close to being worth 18.00.  If you\'re going to charge prices like this, the food must be out of this world and the customer service top rate.  Neither of which were the case.\n\nIf the bartender\'s service wasn\'t so poor, I probably would have given them 2.5-3 stars.  However, it was that poor, and we will not be back to Craigie on Main any time soon.']
["I came here again, despite being slightly disappointed in their tasting menu last time. \n\nBut this time, I have to recommend the pig's head for two. It was absolutely delicious and executed perfectly. Cocktails, as usual, were very good--perfectly balanced and we had a nice chat with the bartender since we were sitting at the bar. Service is also excellent. Just minus one star for our vegetable dishes, which were tasty but uninteresting. I would probably just minus half a star if I could."]
["Found this spot, thanks to Yelp. I was looking for something in Cambridge and this kept on leaping off of the page. \n\nI got lucky with reservations. I checked OpenTable the day of and only 5:30 and 9pm were open. Not that great. I called around noon and was told they were going through cancellations and that she would call me back. I ended up with two seats at the Chef's table (which are front row seats to the kitchen). I guess they stagger the reservations because we were told they were fully booked when I tried to adjust the headcount last minute, but when we arrived we saw plenty of empty seats. Understandable. \n\nWe opted for the farm to market menu: $80 for an amuse bouche, app, entree, and dessert with wine pairing. We varied our choices for more variety. I asked for a copy of the menu, but never got one, so this is going off of memory. \n\nAMUSE BOUCHE:\nWe had one with proscuitto. The other was two croquetas with squid ink. \n\nAPPETIZER:\n- Ragout. This was a beauty. Wild forest mushrooms, vegetables, egg, and rabbit sausage. The egg breaks over everything. \n- Scallop Appetizer. A la plancha. Also, beautifully plated. There were two of them and had a nice char. \n\nENTREE:\n- Pork 3x. A little underwhelming. \n- Striped Bass. Came with chorizo broth and razor clams. It was good. \n\nSide: Bone Marrow. Excellent. Came with toasted bread. \n\nDESSERT:\n- Sorbets. \n- Grits with Anise Ice Cream and Strawberries. I really enjoyed this. I'm typically not a big fan of anise, but the bruleed grits and sauteed strawberries was perfectly balanced with the quickly melting anise ice cream.\n- Monbazillac. I got a dessert wine since it was included. Good, but I could've done without it. \n\nI also enjoyed watching the kitchen and seeing how much attention to detail, teamwork, and preparation goes into each dish. Our server was ok. Seemed a little nervous, but did not deter from the experience at all."]
["Ok so i posted this review today and by afternoon it was gone. Seems alittle odd to me. This place gets great rating but as soon as someone gives a bad review the review disappears. hmmm\n\nMy Wife and I went to Craigie last night. We have been hearing &amp; reading all the glowing reviews and press. So we were really looking forward to it. We try and get out a few times a month to eat at some of the better restaurants in Boston.\n\nWe got there early and had a drink at the bar and then we were seated at our table in the dining room. Bar was nice and drinks were good.\n\nWe ordered 3 Apps. The Server told us they were the best three on menu\n1.Scallops ( Very very Bland &amp; Boring &amp; small)\n2.Octapus  ( Tender &amp; Tasty but far from mind blowing)\n3. Pasta with wild Boar (The best of the three but still i expected much more)\n\nAs we finished the apps The dirty plates sat in front of us as our water was filled and server asked how we liked everything. But no one took plates so I ended up asking if they could take them. \n\nOur Main Dish,\nMy Wife got the Roasted Chicken and i got The Pork Trio. I have read good things about both of these dishes in other reveiws.\n\nHere is where Craigie loses me. \n\nThe mains came out and they were the same size if not smaller than the appitizers. Both dishes tasted ok. Again far far FAR from mind blowing. The pork dish came with 1 pork rib, a small piece of pork belly and another small piece of pork. My wifes Chicken was gone in a couple bites.  We understand fine dining  and more is not always better, but this was like a joke.  \n\nSo after about  2 minutes of eating our tiny main dish it was time to think about dessert. My Plate was cleared but my wifes sat in front of her for way to long. (over 10 minutes)\n\nDessert,\nMy wife got the Chocolate Peanut Parfait and i got the Rasberry Tart.\nParfait was ok but the Tart was nothing great you could get a better one from any local bakery.\n\nI understand Craigie gets great reviews but i just dont get it. The Flavor profiles were not that good and portion size was all wrong. There are so many amazing places to eat in Boston that crush this place. I have no idea how craigie does so well. \n\nOur bill came in at over $200 before tip. For that much money you can bet I would be eating at  l'espalier anyday. \n\nWe will never go back to Craigie on Main. There are just way to many other choices that have way better food,service and portions. Such as Hungry Mother, Eastern Standard Kitchen, l'espalier, Gaslight, Bergamot, Russell House Tavern the list goes on and on."]
["First, the atmosphere: upscale, but casual. I wore a t-shirt and jeans and didn't feel out of place. The mood inside Craigie on Main is exactly the opposite of the stereotypical fancy restaurant. Not overly staid or fussy at all. It was full of people bustling around, chatting and enjoying themselves. Super comfortable. \n\nThe service was probably the best I've ever experienced. Everyone I encountered was friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable. Even though we were there for more than two hours, at no point did I feel rushed or pressured to leave. We were able to really relax and enjoy our meal at our own pace.\n\nThe food. Good lord, the food. I can really only describe it as transcendent. There were three of us at our table and we all made sure to order something different for each course. Every single dish was delicious, but there were definitely a few standouts. The grilled octopus I had for my appetizer was so tender and succulent -- I have never before had octopus so expertly prepared. The bone marrow that we ordered as a side dish was incredible -- rich and gelatinous. We also HAD to try the famous pig's head, and it did not disappoint. Crispy skin, tender meat, that delicious hoisin-based sauce with the Peking pancakes... I was so sad when it was all gone. For dessert, I had a summer fruit galette (so flaky and buttery!) with amaretto ice cream. And yes, it was as good as it sounds. \n\nI cannot recommend Craigie on Main enough. It is, hands down, my new favorite restaurant."]
["We came to Craigie for my 30th birthday - because I have the best husband in the world and he booked it for my treat!\n\nHonestly, I know it's been said before, but I just couldn't fault it. The service, the food, everything about our evening was perfection. It's no secret that Craigie is expensive - but to me, worth every penny. We had the eight-course tasting menu (hey, you're only 30 once. Thank God!) and every course was stunning. The food is adventurous - there was a lot of cured fish, and things like pigs ears as a garnish - but nothing so wacky that it was scary. \n\nEvery mouthful I ate was beautifully balanced - just a delight. I also liked the fact that the staff rotated so we had different people bring our food - each one as knowledgeable as the next. \n\nSadly, we can't come back as regularly as we would like - cost is prohibitive! But that will make our visits even more special. Yes, it's pricey, but if you like innovative food and great service, it is money well spent."]
["I came back for my mum's birthday, as I mentioned earlier. We ordered a la carte to try as much stuff as we could.\n\nFor appetizers we had:\n 1) grilled spanish octopus: succulent and flavorful, yummy.\n 2) crispy fried pig tails: I expected those little curly cues, but instead we were  presented with pork chop looking pieces of tender meat!\n 3) assiette of house-made terrines: not the best foie gras I've had, but pretty good. Could have been richer and creamier. the non-foie gras components were delicious.\n 4) ragoût of four bean and local forest mushrooms: if you are a mushroom fan like me, then this is a must. a light, savory flavor. innovative egg turned soup.\n 5) house-made rye flour radiatore pasta: hearty and savory, and a nice large portion\n\nFor entrees:\n 1) grassfed sirloin à la poêle: solid steak. \n 2) Vermont pork three ways: delicious! This was the best. Reminded me again of how well this place makes the piggies. \n 3) some trout dish: my dad ordered this dish, but I think it might have been a bit undercooked for him, so I took it instead. I think it was cooked well, just it had dill (I think) and I learned that I don't like dill very much. This was obviously not on Craigie though.\n\nFor desserts:\n 1) Malted Milk Parfait: delicious and chocolatey, with the extra crunch of peanuts delightful. got swiped by my dad, it was so good.\n 2) Three house-made sorbets: yummy and fruity! \n 3) Whole Wheat Crepes: lighter and creamy but with an almost airy texture\n\nI plan to come back! Can't wait to have some dishes next time all to myself XD"]
["I don't review restaurants a whole lot because I know there are so many factors that go into experiences. I've been to some places several times and have had up and down experiences. I think that's just the nature of a business that's so sensitive to people's feelings/emotions/burdens that day. Anyways...I decided to write a review for COM for the one time I went, because I felt compelled. \n\nI'm giving it 5 stars because everything came together perfectly--the service, the timing, the quality, the atmosphere. All of it. \n\nI met my boyfriend here after work on a Friday. He wanted to sit at the bar, so he got there a bit early to avoid the crowds. I got there around 6, and we both sat at the bar. The bartender (his name evades me, I was there a few months ago) was. The. Absolute. Best. Friendly, informative, and engaging, he had a wide knowledge of spirits, liquors and cocktailery (not sure if that's a word). The cocktails were crafted by him, and he was great at recommending beers and cocktails that suited each of our tastes, and was happy to give us samples. \n\nTruth be told, my boyfriend and I were there to try their famous burger. I'm not going to tell you how to get the burger since it will not be on the menu, but if you read this review carefully, you'll be able to get an idea of how to do it. Anyways, safe to say it was really the best burger I've ever eaten. I'm not even a huge fan of burgers (or beef, for that matter), but I will go back just for this. We ended up splitting the burger and a side of duck-fat-roasted brussel sprouts (all their food products are locally sourced, BOOYAH). And then the manager came out with...three giant bones of roasted bone marrow. I LOVE BONE MARROW. And these weren't the gimpy, underfed cow bone marrow bones. These things were LEGIT. I'm drooling thinking about them. And they were complimentary. Which was the sweetest thing, because we felt we were pretty unassuming and didn't really order a whole lot off the menu. It was a small gesture, but just very thoughtful--how did they know I love bone marrow?! Magic, I say. \n\nAtmosphere-wise, I can see how this place has the potential to attract a slightly pretentious crowd. It's price points are on the slightly higher side, but it's worth it. And potential douchery isn't enough to retract a star. Quite frankly, people who do that are the pretentious ones. It was just a lovely experience. Get there now Get there early (it can get busy). And seriously--be kind to the entire staff there. They appreciate it just as much as you would appreciate their kindness. They're great, friendly people, who seem like they  highly value paying it forward."]
['I had been thwarted on previous attempts to eat here. My so-called "friends" like to have Sunday "brunch" at 1:30pm or later. Well, this place is always busy and closes at 2 on Sundays so that usually doesn\'t pan out. But today! Enjoyed a cheap movie at the Sunday matinee price and voila, found ourselves looking for lunch in Central Square around 1pm. Yay! \n\nWe didn\'t have a reservation, but our group of three was seated within 10 min. The restaurant is located on the corner of a triangular-shaped block so it\'s an unusual space, but they\'ve made it work. The bar, kitchen, and bathroom are along the hypotenuse. The corners are full of tables, including one area that can be closed off with curtains for a small private party. There are lots of homey touches with pigs, books, pottery, mirrors, and pictures that give the space a modern French country feel. \n\nThey were pretty busy so it took a little time to get drinks, order, and eventually our food, but it was worth it. My partner got an omelet with mushrooms, spinach, herbs, and just enough feta for taste, but not overpower the flavor. It came with toast and thinly sliced potato salad. I ordered a burger (the last of the day!) with grass-fed beef, cheddar, "mace" ketchup, housemade sesame seed bun and came with a celery root slaw, housemade pickles, thinly sliced fried fries, and fresh greens. I split this with a friend who got the whole wheat pancakes with apple compote, ginger ice cream, and a raspberry jam on the side. \n\nThe food was so good. Everything just tasted so fresh. My burger almost melted in mouth and the ketchup had this hint of spice and tanginess. Before I knew it, it was all gone. The fries are deceptively thin, crispy, and not greasy, but there\'s plenty to fill you up. The pancakes were wholesome and dense; the ice cream and syrup added a touch of sweetness without any heaviness. My partner finished everything on his plate. And he doesn\'t usually eat much. We were stuffed after these plates so no dessert for us. \n\nIt was fun to watch the exposed kitchen at work. Service was fantastic, attentive without hovering. I had to pee the second I got home because they kept our water glasses full. They offered literature with their menu and the check about their beliefs. All of the ingredients are locally sourced. They recycle almost everything and compost. The entire immediate family works at the restaurant. All of the staff undergoes training. They review all written customer comments nightly. It\'s an amazing place. Pricey, but well worth it, especially considering the quality of the food you\'re getting and to support their business model. Go for a special occasion. Handicapable-accessible, best for small groups, reservations recommended.']
["100% expensive, 20% delicious.\n\nI had the prix fixe menu - 8 courses. Everything was fine, but that's about it. At no point was I wowed. Our wait staff was nice, if not overly subservient. \n\nThe only reason I can think of for the high ratings Craigie has received is that customers are willing to let their tastebuds be fooled by extremely detailed descriptions of the one to two bites of food that are placed before them."]
["Went here for brunch and ordered:\n\n1) Donuts  - delicious\n\n2) Hamburger - too salty..(I don't see what the hype is all about..sure the quality of the meat was excellent..you can tell by how the meat melts in your mouth with each bite.  Maybe it was an off day, but it was too salty..for such great meat..hold back the salt!\n\n3) Pasta w/duck - delicious\n\nService was excellent.  Will be back!"]
["Possibly one of the best restaurants....ever. \n\nPros: Romantic, Food is fantastic, service is great, wine is great (also bourbon). Been several times now, and I highly recommend the chef's testing menu.\n\nCons: Expensive.\n\nThis place rocks. It's expensive, but totally worth it."]
["3 stars on the kitchen, 4 1/2 stars on the service.\n\nI probably won't be back simply because I didn't feel like I got my money's worth, however I did receive very good service.  I ate in the bar area.\n\nThree things:\n\nFirst, service.  I was welcomed nicely, seated promptly, attended to very well.  Their service was very good and I left a very nice tip for that reason.\n\nSecond, food.  Some of the food was very good - for example, the meyer lemon sorbet was very nice.  Too often lemon sorbets are made only from the juice and are over-sweetened at that.  This one had a very nice balance of acid, sweetness and bitterness from the peel.  I appreciated that.  The beignets were also very well executed, and I'm not even much of a sweets person.  Some of the food was not. But for the six-course whim menu, I was served:\n\nSome sort of fish that was amuse-buche sized. - tasty \n\nSmelts  - which I love, but there were only 3\n\nGigantic asparagus spears with a lightly-poached egg - this dish could have used seasoning and a thicker-yolked egg, perhaps a duck egg instead of a chicken one\n\nA pasta with ragu - this was good, but the pasta flavor overpowered the ragu, which is impressive in a way, but maybe not in a good way.  And the pasta on the edges were stone cold, which was a disappointment.\n\nSome sort of rolled-up chicken on a baby-food-like bed of something - this dish was hotel-restaurant quality.  I had a similar dish at the now-closed 2-Michelin-starred Ria in Chicago that was mind-blowingly good, but this one was boring and executed only moderately-well\n\nLemon sorbet - this was the best lemon sorbet I've ever had\n\nBeignets - these were very good\n\nKitchen: I know a whim menu will be less predictable than a fixed one, but it was kind of an odd collection and order to the food, everything from the sizing to the content didn't seem to flow well.  Also, I wasn't expecting to be there over 2 hours for a 6-course meal.  Alinea in Chicago can get you through 18 courses in 3 hours, so six courses, where only two of them were larger than appetizers, seems a bit long - especially when seated at the bar.\n\nOverall, the chef obviously has talent, and he's assembled a wonderful service staff.  The level of the food, however, did seem inconsistent.  Granted the price I paid was partially due to the drinks I ordered,  however if the food had come a bit quicker, I would have gotten by with fewer drinks.\n\nAt any rate, I'm glad I went, and I enjoyed myself thanks to the excellent service, but I'm not sure I'll be back for the food anytime soon."]
['Craigie was the best meal I had in my entire stay in Boston, and a perfect way to end my culinary tour of the city. Chef Tony Maws does a fantastic job of using unconventional ingredients and powerful flavors to make really memorable dishes, and if you reserve early enough you can even snag a table right in front of the kitchen for a really special treat. I had been anticipating my evening at Craigie the entire time I was in Boston, so it was an easy decision for me to do the 10 course tasting menu for $115, and to go ahead and do the 4 drink "cocktail whim" tasting along with it for just $20. [Note: Photos of each course are uploaded here and Flickr: http://www.flickr.com/photos/wedoitforlove/4179871607/in/set-72157622864759653/]\n\n#1 - seafood trio of crispy brandade fritter, fresh uni w/ lime pickle vinaigrette, &amp; squid noodles w/ nuoc cham: While these were probably the most simple flavors of the night, each item really showcased its raw characteristics, and I especially liked the fritter. The noodles were also very unique, and the quality of the uni was very high.\n\n# 2 - salad of hiramasa sashimi w/ red onion-shiso salsa, avocado, &amp; harissa-rose vinaigrette: The quality of the yellowtail was top-notch and harissa is probably my favorite spice, so this dish was a major hit. The avocado was a nice addition as well, as the creamy texture really mirrored that of the fish, and did a nice job cooling down the harissa heat.\n\n# 3 - grilled Nantucket Bay scallops w/ salsa verde, golden raisin-verjus sauce, &amp; curry oil: My third rendition of these scallops in less than a week, and unfortunately these were the least impressive of the three, mainly because of the simplicity compared to the other two. Although, the size of these was slightly greater, but you only get a few, so it doesn\'t really make up for it. The curry oil was a nice addition though, and they were probably the best cooked scallops of the week.\n\n# 4 - red chile &amp; sesame marinated Faroe Island sea trout kama (the shoulder): Wow, this course was absolutely out of this world. If you ever see this on any of the menus here I suggest ordering it, the kama is so delicious and fatty and it just melts off the carcass. The red chile goes great with the fish, neutralizing any overly fishy characteristics this piece would normally have. Freakin awesome!\n\n# 5 - lasagnette of house-made rabbit sausage w/ fresh local mozzarella &amp; celery root puree: Another home-run dish. The rabbit flavor in this dish is intense and game-y in a really pleasing way. There was plenty of meat too, and the mozzarella was so gooey and delicious with the rabbit. The presentation of this dish is also interesting and you get a real surprise out of your first bite.\n\n# 6 - slow cooked Vermont organic lamb rib w/ burnt caramel vinaigrette &amp; crispy shallots: As you can probably imagine this was another fantastic course, it\'s obvious Chef Maws is an expert with meats. The lamb was so tender and moist, and the burnt caramel was a delicious rub to put on the rib, I\'m definitely going to try this combo back home. I would of course have liked a little more than one big rib, but I\'m sure most people are really full by the end of this tasting menu as it is.\n\n# 7 - Pain d\'Epice crusted Texas sika venison leg w/ venison sausage, red quinoa, autumn olives, quince puree, &amp; fall farm vegetables: Finally, the main event! I was really excited to try this duo of venison, and was not disappointed at all in the execution. The vegetables were nice, but really seemed like an afterthought, especially separated from the meat like they were. The flavors in the venison half however were uber delightful, really taking you straight into the woods. Every ingredient really stood out distinctly, which is hard to do when you\'ve got such a strong game meat as the highlight.\n\n# 8 - jasmine tea infused panna cotta w/ candied citrus zest: Like most of the other reviewers, I was a little bummed by this course, and it was the only one I would really have liked to replace. Flavor wise the dish is ok, it just comes across as really underwhelming, and considering there were two other "desserts" on their way I thought this felt a little unnecessary.\n\n# 9 - olive oil &amp; taza chocolate mousse w/ walnut coulis: It looks pretty ugly, but it tastes outstanding. The flavors here mesh so well, and the chocolate is superior quality.\n\n# 10 - ancho chile &amp; cardamom spiced Valrhona hot chocolate: A very nice, fitting end to the evening. Never miss a chance to indulge in something simple, yet refined, and always add a bit of spice.\n\nAs for the cocktail whim, here were the drinks, in order:\n"Belle de Jour" - champagne w/ housemade grenadine\n"Corkscrewdriver" - gin &amp; absinthe\n"Communal Rye" - whiskey, housemade vermouth, orange\n"Jerez Flip" - Oloroso sherry, eggnog, nutmeg\n\nThey were all great drinks, especially the Rye. This restaurant exemplifies what I expect from a tasting menu (not a bunch of fru-fru veggies).']
["Everything you could ever want from a neighborhood restaurant.\n\nHad the charcuterie for an app and the pork three ways for an entree.  Everything was excellent.  Service was exemplary--muted but attentive.  Even amuses before apps and dessert were great, as were the macaroons after dessert.  Can't nitpick about a thing."]
['Best meal I had during my trip to Boston.  We were a group of 3 and we had the 6 course tasting menu.  Everything was delicious.  The standout dishes were the bluefin tuna and the swordfish.  Our table tried a number of the cocktails and all were excellent.  Our waiter picked a few half bottles of wine to pair with our courses and his choices were spot on.  We were close enough to the kitchen to watch the food preparation and they worked like a well oiled machine.  I will definitely go back next time I am in the area.']
["BEST MEAL I've had in Boston thus far. We did the 6-course chef's tasting menu and I enjoyed nearly every dish. It was mostly seafood, which was like hitting the jackpot for me. My two favorite dishes were the tuna and the banana bread dessert...out of this world. The only thing I did not like was the very first sampler dish, which had three little samples. The first sample was bass I think and it was just too fishy for me to handle. \n\nOther than that, everything was excellent. Service and ambience were great. Our waitress made great wine recommendations as well. I especially liked the Sancerre they had."]
['Had the pleasure to enjoy brunch on a Sunday and had some drinks at the bar. The bartender Anne is a legend. She is a rock star!']
["I don't get it. It was extremely expensive,  an 8 course tasting menu took 3 hours, it was a hard sell all night for alcohol and the food was meh. We have eaten at 6 of the 9 3 Michelin star restaurants in the US so I understand pricing and pacing of tasting menus but this was absurd. Go to the Salty Pig instead, eat better and save at least a hundred bucks."]
['Super fine dining in a casual atmosphere.\n\nCraigie on Main is a great place for a special occasion, so make reservations and get ready for an incredible dining experience.  We were seated in the bar area at a high-top which was great so we could watch the olde-timey mixologist bar tender, complete with vest and handlebar mustache, stir and shake up cocktails as we enjoyed our meal.  It began with unique cocktails and I would highly recommend anything on their libations list.  Our server was very knowledgeable and happy to offer suggestions when we asked. At her recommendation I had the Never Setter which was delicious and the server suggested something off menu for my wife who just described that she wanted something light and fruity\n\nFor our first course i had crispy fried pig tails that were absolutely sublime.  When they arrived at our table the food runner told me that "Tony likes you to pick them up and eat with your hands."  Who am I to say no to a James Beard award winning chef, so i happily dove hands first into the crispy, melt in your mouth fatty, fall of the bone swine tail.  My wife had asparagus a la schmaltz, which she described as the best asparagus she\'d ever had.\n\nFor the main course I had Vermont pork 3 ways, the best of which was the suckling con-fit.  My wife had the famed burger, and it was every bit as good as it was hyped up to be.  Just the right amount of meaty flavor and topped with local cheese and delicious homemade ketchup.  We split a slide of crispy, duck fat fried, brussel sprouts that were perfect.  Soft in the middle and crispy burnt leaves on the outside.\n\nSince my meal was the 3 course prix fix we split the dessert it came with.  I\'m not usually a big fan of dessert right after dinner, but the creme caramel was light and delicious - the perfect amount of sweet to end the meal.\n\nOverall Craigie on Main was a fantastic experience worthy of a special occasion.  I can\'t wait for an excuse to go back!']
["My husband and I came here tonight and tried the 8-course tasting menu. We were not disappointed. The food combinations blended together perfectly. We liked the food that we had so much that we added another dessert  (3 kinds of sorbet) and 2 different kinds of teas. Everything they do is understated but perfect. The service was spot-on and friendly. We will come back and try their burger and more of the dessert menu. The ambiance is warm and definitely doesn't have the stuck up feeling that lots of other high-end restaurants have. I liked how we could see the kitchen from the dining area."]
["I did the five course tasting menu. Unbelievable. I enjoyed every dish. Jeremy our waiter was fabulous as well, very knowledgable about the food and wine. The service was great, the food was great, and the wine was great. I go out to dinner once a week to a different good 4-5 star restaurant in Boston and this was absolutely one of the most memorable meals I've had in a while. The head chef even came out to serve us one of our courses. Top notch. I recommend this place to anyone who considers them self a foodie."]
['The food was great and though the restaurant is a bit meat-centric, vegetarian options and accommodations were not a problem.  The food was fresh and deliciously prepared.\n\nThe bar and wait staff were knowledgeable, pleasant and very much willing to please.\n\nThe problem was the kitchen staff.  The food was beyond slow.  They were yelling and looked in a frenzy.  In a rush to deliver our apps, the waitress dropped one plate on the floor which further slowed things down.  We ended up having to get our entrees to go.\n\nNot sure I would go back.']
['You know what- I hate writing reviews on things that already have a ton of 5 stars because I feel like...yeah, you get it.  But my first experience at Craigie On Main last night is 5 star review worthy. \n\nLike most other yelpers, I go out to eat...probably too much.  So it was awesome to be able to see a menu that is unlike anything else in Boston and the burbs.  Everything was fantastic.  We started with the house made cocktails before we went to wine.  When I go back, I will probably get another 4 cocktails because they were amazing!  I highly recommend the trio of pork.  The man got the crispy pig tails to start and raved about them (though I did not venture there).  \n\nThis is a dining style experience, so settle in and enjoy the rhythm of the meal.  Also, from almost anywhere in the place you can see the kitchen, which makes for a fresh, exciting, and sometimes intense atmosphere.  I will definitely be back!']
['My wife and I went here for New Year\'s Eve and had a great time!  The food was very good and drinks were great!  Kitchen was very well run, also!\n\nWe had a slight issue with the bill being incorrect, but after writing my first review and expressing that "We had a great time but..." , the manager contacted me and resolved the accidental overcharge.  They took care of everything without me having to return on a day off to resolve it.  She was very accommodating and friendly.  I was already going to come back for more since I have a gift card to use from christmas time, but I will definitely be back after it has long been used up!']
['Maybe it\'s me, but I simply was not impressed with "the burger".  The beef was good, not exceptional, and I got a few pieces of gristle that detracted. The bun was good but other accompaniments--barely there cheddar, bespoke catsup--didn\'t hold up. I liked the celeriac slaw and pickles on the side and perhaps should have loaded them on the burger for an extra spurt of flavor that was missing. Excellent cocktails and a fun atmosphere but with a $150 tab for burgers and drinks for 2, we won\'t hurry back.']
["Came here for an anniversary dinner last winter. \n\nWe had an incredible meal &amp; a hot toddy that still has me thinking about it a year later (the best I've ever had) \n\nThe chef has won a James Beard award and you can easily see why when you taste the food and experience the service. \n\nThis place is at the top of my list for Boston dining!"]
["So I finally made it to Craigie!  It was a long time coming but I hate to report that I left a little disappointed (not sure if/when I will be back).\n\nI had the Sunday night 4-course chef's tasting menu (which is a fantastic deal) with a side of bone marrow and a side of fresh asparagus.  Here's what we ate:\n\n1. Smoked sturgeon with American caviar: this was good but really not anything out of the ordinary.  I feel like I could buy this at an ethnic Eastern or Northern European foodstore and get alot more for the money.  Grade: C.\n\n2. Fish with harissa: Cant remember the details of this dish but it was a good inventive mix of flavors.  Some delicate fish topped with Moroccan harissa and a side dollop of avocado puree. Grade B.\n\n3. Fried Maine Clams in Squid Ink: Not doing this dish justice with the description but there really wasn't much to it other than the use of high quality ingredients and the delicious squid ink. Grade B.\n\n4. Venison and Sausage: final course was good...but nothing really mind-blowing.  In fact, a bit disappointing as the final course of the meal.  I expected mind-blowing.  Luckily, this was served with the asparagus (which was tasty) and the bone marrow (the biggest and best I've ever had). Overall Grade: C+\n\n5. Dessert Course: Caramel flan with candied kumquats and sweet potato crisps.  The other dessert had an amaretto sorbet with pistachios and some kind of tart (can't remember).  This was all very good and more than I expected given the rest of the meal.  Grade: B+\n\nI guess the next time I go back I'll try my luck with some a la carte selections.  The tasting just didn't deliver on expectations (even though it was an unbelievable value)."]
["First time at Craigie and they didn't disappoint!  We were on a limited budget and let them know. They steered us to the bar for the limited supply of bar burgers. Absolutely delicious with handmade bacon and farm fresh egg on top. We added the oysters, pig's tails(our favorite), octopus and fried clams. Our server Monica couldn't have been better!  Her knowledge was astounding and her warm manner was perfect!  Loved dessert and cocktails as well. We will all be back."]
['Wow. What an experience. My boyfriend and I sat by the kitchen - which is the right choice if you want a show while you enjoy uniquely delicious food. The service is definitely the top of the line by everyone - wait staff, food runners, kitchen staff, one of the chefs said hello to us so we could gush about the food and restaurant overall. Seriously such a great place. This is definitely a MUST come in boston. We ordered the crispy pig ear, pork three ways (we got 5 ways anyway because the chef is awesome), and the swordfish. The food was seasoned so well and cooked perfectly- nothing over or under cooked. Temperature was on point.']
["Best meal in boston. Black pasta and blue fish were Devine!!!  Dessert was just as good if you're a foodie go!!!"]
['With memories of that perfect chicken from Craigie Street Bistro dancing in my head, I talked the boy into checking CoM out when our first choice, Salts, turned out to be "closed for repairs". We checked upon entering that they could accommodate a vegetarian, and were reassured. We settled in for a 3 course meal. Cocktails were good, albeit dainty, and the recommended wines were amazing. Service was also quite good, especially the 2nd server, server in waiting, understudy, busgirl, whatever her title -- she was wonderfully refreshing and friendly. I wish the food lived up to my fond memories! The amuses were delicious and appreciated. The boy liked his veg version of the romescu pasta, but was completely underwhelmed by the vegetable glacee with wheat berries main. Probably that order should be reversed, even if pasta is traditionally a "first course". My requested chicken initially arrived as striped bass on a small misstep, but was quickly replaced by the chicken itself. The spätzle accompaniment was delicious. The chicken was tender, if flavorless, and might have benefited from a crispier skin. My octopus first course was just ok (Neptune\'s is amazing and nothing compares). Dessert was interesting and I thought tasty, but the boy was not to be consoled and we left a bit disappointed (and his wallet quite a bit lighter) after our date night. Sigh.']
["Yup, it's the real deal. The whole snout to tail thing (and yes, get the pigs tails) done really well. We got the smaller tasting menu, yet other little things kept coming out of the kitchen so it ended up being 9 items instead of 6. All really well executed, well paced. The room was draft when we first arrived, but warmed up and was quite loud by the time we left. Well worth the $$$."]
['I came here once, about 6 years ago with my then-boyfriend.  We both still maintain that the experience and the food that we had at this restaurant was hands down the best meal we have ever had. I do not remember every dish that we had, but I do remember that we enjoyed every last dish. They asked when we first sat if we had any requests for dishes and I asked for fois gras. It was one of the best fois gras dishes I ever had - light, fatty, but not overwhelming. The meal lasted several hours and the small intimate ambience of the restaurant was a perfect setting for our anniversary dinner. The price is nothing to laugh about, so you will definitely want to save up some cash to be able to afford this place, but you will definitely feel as the money was worth the price of the food and the amazing service that you receive here!']
['Underwhelming and Over-hyped. Had their "signature" dish the Vermont Pork and my  husband had the chicken. I can\'t even remember what we had for apps, it was so disappointing. The wine was also meh. \nMaybe I\'ll go back and try the burger. But never again for dinner.']
['The whole hog dinner was worth every penny.  Special kudos to the manager for making what could of been a bad situation and turning it into an awesome night.']
["Update 2/6/12:\n\nOne of the owners contacted me about my negative review and did her best to address the issues we had throughout our meal. Our experience must not be the norm, based on the reaction I received. They were truly sorry for the mistakes made and I'm very impressed with the response. Its very rare to see an owner or manager who clearly cares so much about how they treat their customers. If we lived in Boston I would definitely give them a second chance!"]
["I can't believe I haven't written a review on Craigie yet! What an utter gem. Chef Tony Maws is a madman genius with his creations. I have had the 10-course tasting dinner. Have you ever been drunk and giddy on food alone? That's the experience. It's joy, fun, and seriously should be the first thing on anyone's list of Things to Do Before I Check Out to the Great Beyond. If it were socially acceptable, we would've started dancing on the tables at the squid noodles.\n\nGo to Craigie. The atmosphere is fantastic, the food is otherworldly, and the whole experience is worthy of your time and money. The staff loves what they do, and that comes across in spades. Brunch, dinner, multiple course menus, or drinks at the bar - just go!"]
['Craigie is so awesome that my 5-star review got flagged and removed...for being too awesome?  Who removes a 5-star review???  \n\nStill my top three fav restaurants in Boston/Cambridge.']
["Pig's head for two sold out! So I got the chicken two ways.\n\nThis is still my favorite restaurant in the Boston/Cambridge area."]
["My husband and I went here to celebrate his birthday. We each got the three-course prix fixe - a starter, an entree, and a dessert - along with cocktails before and coffee for me after.\n\nI agree with other reviewers who rave about the quality of the service. Everyone restaurant employee was friendly and helpful. In fact, when the restaurant called to confirm our reservation, the woman asked me if there were any food 'concerns' we might have. When I said I try to eat gluten free, she assured me they could accommodate me _and_ that the server would be informed, too. Sure enough, while he was seating us, he told me specifically that he could answer all my questions about gluten on the menu. If only all restaurants treated their customers this way!\n\nThe food was excellent, too, an ideal range of poultry, seafood, beef, and vegetarian dishes. The mix of tasty flavors really impressed me as well-- the chicory greens in my salad, the apricots and mushrooms with my slow-roasted chicken, the prunes marinated in port with my husband's pork belly entree. My husband raved about the rustic rolls--crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside. I asked the bartender to make me a mocktail and he sent over an exquisite concoction of grenadine, honey, fruit juices, and ginger ale-- it was peppery and citrusy, not too sweet, just perfect.\n\nI just don't have anything bad to say about our experience. We dined for about two hours, we never felt rushed or overwhelmed by noise--it was just simply a quality meal in a comfortable atmosphere, and I would gladly go back again."]
['Host and wait staff were exceptional - well trained, hospitable, personable, engaged.  Loved them. \n\nKitchen staff grossed us out - chef repeatedly licked a utensil and returned it to food without cleaning it.    Our "medium" steak was super rare, medium-well burger was very rare.  Oysters unpleasant. Fries were really good - but rest of the meal was unmemorable at best.  \n\nOddly, I spent the time to fill out a review card, and, a week later, haven\'t hear from them.  \n\nI\'m not sure what the raves are about.  Overpriced.  Under delivered.']
["Wonderful presentation and great thought behind the dishes. The place always has an energetic vibe. The pig's head is very good albeit one of the most greasy dishes I have ever had!\n\nAlso, if you can get the seats at the dais where you can watch the chefs at work in the open kitchen, it is a great experience that will help you understand how a chef's kitchen works better!"]
["Oh look, another Craigie review! \n\nLook, these guys are crushing it.  It's quite expensive and it just doesn't matter.  It's not about bragging, it's about delivering...and they do.  \n\nIt may not be for everyone, but isn't that the point?  True not everyone wants to eat fried smelts with squid ink, roasted pig's head, fried pig's tail with peanuts and nuoc cham, or $20 burgers...or $18, whatever...add the egg and the bacon it's at least $20 for a burger.  If you like cow, they'll treat it with respect and it really tasted like a tribute to cow.  I know a few extra ingredients that go into it and it's damn tasty!  \n\nnom nom nom...go get one and become the 1000th review on yelp!"]
['When searching for restaurants for our Boston vacation, I happened upon Craigie on Main, and when I saw that they serve fried pigs\' tails, I was sold. I read Little House in the Big Woods as a kid, and was always intrigued by the scene where Laura\'s father roasts the pig\'s tail for her and Mary. She just made it sound so fucking delicious. Here was my chance to finally try it!\n\nCraigie did not disappoint, and neither did the pigs\' tails. They were probably the best part of the meal (I was so attached to the idea of them that I ordered them *in addition to* the eight-course tasting menu -- probably a mistake, as you\'ll find out later), but not by much! All eight courses ranged from very very tasty (the house-made corkscrew pasta) to "holy shit I\'m dying of delicious" (the sashimi with harissa). It was all a bit too much for me, though -- after the 5th course, I ended up having to tell our server to box the rest, as I was beyond stuffed. I managed to save room for a bite of the apricot-marzipan pie, though, which was pretty divine.\n\nOverall, a worthy choice for fine dining in the Boston area. I\'m really glad we went here and I\'d definitely go back, for the pigs\' tails alone!']
['I was really disappointed after my girlfriend and I spent an evening for dinner here with the eight-course tasting menu. I didn\'t at all feel that this place lived up to its reviews and publicity. Everything seemed off.\n\nThe service was uncoordinated--we had been asked several times by whom I initially believed to be our server if we had in fact "met" our server. Drinks were not promptly refilled even after making eye-contact with the members of the waitstaff. Despite the fact we mentioned our previous experience with tasting menus at other restaurants had taken an upwards of 3 hours to get through a dinner, and given assurances that was not the case here, we still wrapped up a 9pm seating at 11:30, averaging about 20 long minutes between courses.\n\nBut the food was the biggest let down. From the cold bread (why even cover it up with a napkin in a basket if it\'s ice cold to begin with?), to the lack luster progression of unpleasant flavors and textures, the inclusion of micro-greens on every single dish (even dessert) led to just a very odd menu. Nothing seemed to be tied to the time of year either--we experienced spring and summer inspired flavors in October. We were also miffed the amuse was counted towards one of the courses. In all of our other experiences this is usually compliments of the kitchen.\n\nThe standout dish was the slow roasted cod which was texturally magnificent, but just didn\'t work with the other elements of the dish like broccoli. The scallop sashimi was overly acidic--like licking a lemon--ruining the subtle sweetness of the scallop. In fact all of the first three dishes shared the same overly bright profile and suffered the same flaws, fatiguing us by the time we got to the fifth course a simple pasta which was just fine. The duck-breast-stuffed porchetta (incorrectly described to us as porchetta-stuffed duck-breast) was throughly gag inducing, basically like eating a piece of solid pig fat--a textural nightmare compared to the cod. The dessert was a major downer. Two dishes, one with fennel ice cream (ugh) and the other, a miso cheesecake, featured puffed rice and japanese sweet potato (just because japanese is in the name doesn\'t mean it belongs in a dessert) both misfired with odd compliments of flavors and ingredients. I\'ve had unconventional desserts that have forever changed my mind about the inclusion of certain ingredients in a dessert; this was not one of those unfortunately.\n\nWe left feeling very disappointed as well as a bit confused. Was there something we missed? Was this an off night? Maybe we just didn\'t understand the food? Is that even possible? Too many questions went unanswered unfortunately.']
['We were here last night to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was raining so, even though we live within walking distance, we drove (using our resident sticker to park). They do have valet parking for $12.There was barely any parking- husband dropped me off at the restaurant for our reservation (which was at the earliest available 8PM... on a TUESDAY). The place was packed and now I\'m thinking that it\'s graduation week which explains why I was seeing parent-looking people in the dining room. \n\nI was seated right away and given a wine/cocktail list until husband arrived. I sat waiting smelling the delicious food cooking in the kitchen (which is in the middle of the restaurant). The service throughout the evening was attentive. We had the same waitress who took our order, but the serving and busing came from all different people. They were well staffed, for sure. The seating area (at least the one to the left from the entrance) is a little tight for all the foot traffic but we were pretty comfortable. \n\nWe decided to do the Prix Fixe menu; this way you can try most of everything and it does save you a few dollars overall (not much, mind you-- this place is muy expensivo). I had the Rose\' they had by the glass ($12). \nBefore we even began our meal, a server gave us two little tastes of something from the kitchen (complimentary). I can\'t even remember now what it was exactly, but it was definitely bacon. :)\n\nTo start we had the Octopus (a large 1st course!) and the Six Oysters. Then, I had the Vermont Pork Three-Ways: Suckling Confit, Spice-Crusted Rib, Grilled Belly and Husband had the Swordfish. For dessert, I had the Apricot Frangipane Torte\n(pistachio, grains of paradise, amaretto ice cream) and husband had the Banana Millefeuill (parsnip, dates, cocoa wafer). Each part of this meal was amazing and delicious. I was pretty full after the second course, but I also had taken my time to savor and taste every bit of the dish in the way I would think the chef would want me to enjoy it. The spice crusted rib: the meat fell off the bone with a little knock from my fork. \n\nHusband and I tasted each others dishes. This was an indulgent meal, so tasty and delectable. Husband received a perfect pour of his Full Sail Session Lager (perfect head).\n\nThe service was classy, with the addition and removal of appropriate silverware, wine service, bottled still water, etc. But, I think you are are reminded you are in Cambridge when the waitress and and staff are unpretentious, friendly and attentive. Everything here is New England local and they list the businesses they work with in the menu. I spotted a sign in the kitchen that reads, "no compromise." \n\nThis is a perfect place for celebrations, client meals and for people who have large wallets. Oh, and PS-- you should make reservations well in advance to get the time you want.']
['The burger at the bar and specialty drinks are top notch. The local food and friendly service are some of the best in Cambridge.']
["Amazing! Go for the chicken for 2, it is the best chicken you will ever eat. Moreover, the service is professional and very friendly, we had these incredibly lovely waiter, he made our night! It's on the pricier side, but if you have special occasion this is the best you'll get!!"]
['After reading all the glowing press for this place over the years, we decided to finally check it out to celebrate a birthday. When we arrived, the hostess apologized for not having a table immediately ready for us (we had a reservation), but offered us the option of trying the Ringside Seats, as the party that had reserved them had canceled very late. She explained these seats look into the kitchen and feature a chef\'s tasting menu. We love a good culinary adventure, so we eagerly accepted the offer.\n\nIt was an amazing experience. First of all, watching a high-end kitchen in action is really fascinating. I\'m not much for reality television, but I understand why people watch shows like "Hell\'s Kitchen." It looks incredibly fast-paced and stressful, especially in a place like Craigie on Main, where everything is prepared in such an interesting way.\n\nAnyway, the food itself was fascinating. I could go into it at length, but I\'ll just say it was one of the better meals I\'ve had in a while. Top shelf fare without the stuffiness normally associated with it. The wine pairings were excellent. It was a tremendously enjoyable experience all around.\n\nNext time we go, we\'ll try to reserve the Ringside Seats well ahead of time.']
["This has always been a top 5 Boston restaurant based on years of reading countless articles and food blog about Craigie on Main. After 8 years, I finally got to visit with some college friends and I'm a fan. I ordered a 3 course fixed prix and got crispy fried Maine clams, venison leg and bittersweet chocolate mousse tart. Another friend got the crispy fried pig tails, chicken sausage stuffed chicken and bourbon pecan ice cream tart and the last got bone marrow, grilled spanish octopus, and sour cream cheesecake.\n\nAll the appeziters were delicious, but the grilled octopus and pig tails were my favorite based on tastiness and uniqueness. For entrees, my venison leg was so tender, but the portion was pretty tiny. For dessert, the bourbon pecan ice cream tart was the winner.\n\nNow I need to plan how I'll get a hold of the burger that is so hyped that it can only disappoint. I may have to take a day off work just to try it at this point."]
['Been meaning to try this place for years.  Every time I try to make a reservation, the place is booked.  Have to book way in advance.  \n\nAnyways, my friend was visiting from LA last weekend.  I was going treat her to a nice dinner.  Luckily, there were tables available early Sunday evening.  Some friends had told me to try the tasting menu, that it was to die for!  The food was amazing.  The dishes started off light and slowly got heavier.  We started at 7PM and left around 11PM.  Our server was very attentive.  I will definitely be going back there again!']
["I had the Pork Three Way.\n\nNormally I jazz up these reviews with sexual innuendo or word puns, but I'm serious.  That's what the damn dish was called!  And much as I could have tried to spin that into some raunchy type comment, I think I'll just let your imaginations run wild as to how decadently amazing it was.  I'll say this though; rarely while eating, do I imagine hearing porn-esque music in the background on my mind.  This dish came with a sex-tastic soundtrack that was banging in my head ALL evening.\n\nVermont Pork Three-Ways: Suckling Confit, Spice-Crusted Rib, Grilled Belly...\n\nMmmm.....\n\n*Bow-chicka-wow-wow*\n\nOther reviews already touch on the basics on Craigie.  Expensive.  Fancy.  Delicious. Etc.  They are all true.  Come here for a special occasion and you won't be let down."]
["Local ingredients, amazing service, five stars all around.\n\nWe did the 8-course seasonal tasting, and after each course we announced that it might be the best we've ever had that food prepared. By the end, we were so happy that the venison dish ended the savory courses, because we knew NOTHING could top it. Even the desserts were fabulous- and the server's wine recommendations were perfectly paired with each amazing course. \n\nI highly recommend you go and celebrate life here with amazing wine, food, and people."]
["Go here for a dining experience with an open mind and a clean palate and you will be rewarded. \n\nThe goods;\n\nDark n' Stormy - the make their own ginger beer with a bit of chili oil, giving it a kick like my favorite ginger beer (Goya), +1\n\nThe following is based on the 8 course tasting;\n\nTuna sashimi - delectable pieces of tuna with a spicy Asian sauce, I made sure to finish the sauce even after eating the tuna +1\n\nMullet - an ocean fish which, according to our waiter, was from a fish farm in Spain.

['Much has been said about the "burger experience" at Craigie. After my stab at it, I can say that I understand why it\'s not on the menu, and why Chef Tony Maws treats it as a bit of a sideshow.  It\'s amazing, to be sure, but there are a few caveats.\n\nEmily G. and I came here with a mission: lets see if the burger experience really stacks up to the hype.  Many of us have heard by now that Chef Maws has created what he believes to be the pinnacle of burger achievement.  For my part, I\'d say he\'s not wrong.  Hugely flowing with umami, the blend of meats, suet, dehydrated miso, and bone marrow creates a flavor and mouth feel that is completely unrivalled in any other burger experience.  My burger was made by someone with a lighter hand on the salt and pepper, and so was just slightly underseasoned, but by no means bland.  The soft but structurally sound bun, the light touch of cheese, just a few rings of red onion, and a thin leaf of lettuce lightly coated with their house ketchup is the perfect base construction, and that\'s how I enjoyed it.  For those wanting more accents, a side plate of extra house ketchup, house pickles and house celery root slaw is served - the last being made with a spicy mustard.  \n\nBut let\'s be clear here: this is a "burger" like a Ferrari F430 is a "car".  Yeah, it\'s got wheels and an engine and you drive it, but you\'re not taking it to work every day.  This thing is HEAVY. And by that I mean, it\'s going to sit in your stomach like a big, sleepy atomic bomb. I love that chef Maws has constructed his ideal of what a burger should taste like, and I\'m happy to have experienced it, but I\'m probably not going to try for it again anytime soon. \n\nRATHER: I\'m interested in trying a tasting menu. After experiencing the pure joy that was the pig\'s tails - little fried nuggets of porky heaven - and the smoky, salty delight of the bacon-roasted corn on the cob, I\'m ready for more of the Craigie menu!\n\nService, is, as many have said, impeccable, and the cocktails here are pure delight.  Never mistake though, this is not your everyday dining destination - prices on everything are pretty high, but that\'s to be expected from a top-tier master chef who creates a seasonal, local menu, and sources his foods responsibly.  \n\nCraigie is, as DeNiro said of the bank job in "Heat", worth the stretch.']
['Having recently moved to the US, we were keen to try out some new restaurants. Having read great reviews about Craigie on Main and tasting samples at "Taste of Cambridge" we were super excited to try it out. \n\nFirst some positive feedback - the burger patty tasted great! \n\nUnfortunately this was the only highlight. The waitress was extremely abrupt. She nearly forced us to order drinks upon sitting down, hardly having time to glance at the menu. Then when we asked for a few minutes, she returned 3 times until we eventually, nervously ordered the first cocktails that came to mind. \n\nShe also told us to have the donut (which was not listed on the menu) as an appetizer. We were not explained what it contained or what it looked/tasted like. My husband has a sensitivity to goat\'s milk. Unfortunately the donut contained it!! Eek - she should inform people about that!! \n\nMy husband ordered the burger. He likes his meat well-done (I know it is not "Michelin" star or whatever) but it is what he wants and is paying for. The waitress just gave him this look. How rude! If a customer asks for something, should they not get it? He also just wanted a plain burger, but she said that is already comes with bacon and an egg so we ordered it like that (he did not eat the egg or bacon, but left it on his side plate) but we were charged for it??? \n\nI had the fish plate, it was lovely. I asked the waitress for a new knife, never got one so had to eat my meal with ONLY A FORK! \n\nAt this stage our new server was a guy. We ordered coffees and profiteroles to share. A new waitress, brought us a panna cotta :-( WRONG DESSERT!\n\nWhy keep on switching waiters if they cannot keep track of the order? \n\nOverall the food was slightly greasy, but inventive.\n\nYet the service was very very poor. \nSuch a disappointment.']
['I took my boyfriend to Craigie on Main on his birthday so we could try their award-winning hamburger.  Wow!  It is definitely on our list of top three burgers we have ever tried!\n\nThe burger ($18) is made of grass-fed Hardwick Beef.  To make up for the leanness of grass-fed meat, they add pure beef fat -bone marrow and suet into their burger mix of sirloin, short rib, brisket and dehydrated miso paste for a kick of flavor.  The burger is then steamed in a CVap oven and then grilled on a steel plancha.  The result is a perfectly charred and juicy patty.\n\nMaws only makes about twenty burgers a day, so if you want to give it a try, you have to go on the early side of dinner (5pm - 6pm) or brunch service.  If you are going for dinner, you can only order the burger in the bar area of the restaurant.  You won\'t find the burger on their menu so don\'t be afraid to ask your server for it.  I also recommend making a reservation a week in advance as the bar doesn\'t have much seating.\n\nIn addition to the burgers, I surprised my boyfriend by ordering one of their delicious cakes.  The cakes are fairly expensive ($42 for a cake that serves 1-3 people) , but you won\'t be disappointed!  I ordered the "pastry chef\'s whim", and we were pleasantly surprised to get a lemon chiffon cake that has layers of lemon chiffon, lemon curd, homemade orange marmalade, and white chocolate butter cream frosting.  Yum!\n\nWe have both tried their "chef\'s whim" tasting menu (which we both thoroughly enjoyed).  However, if you are a burger fan, I highly recommend you go to Craigie On Main to try their burger! \n\nAnd, if you are unable to get a reservation (or they have already run out of burgers for that day), go to Four Seasons.  While we loved Craigie On Main\'s burger, I think the Four Seasons burger is slightly (very slightly) better.']
["So, I am almost afraid to write this review. Everybody loves Craigie on Main! But um, I didn't...\n\nSo I have been here twice now. A few months ago, I was here for my birthday and had the chef's tasting menu. In general at that time, I wasn't terribly impressed, I thought the food was a bit salty and not terribly innovative, nor polished. But I refrained from writing a review, thinking maybe it was just an off night.\n\nSo I went for brunch the other day and had\nthe donut\nthe craigie burger\ntheir hash\nand profiteroles\n\n(yeah I eat a lot)\n\nthe donut was delicious, light fluffy, but it's fried dough right?\nboth their hash and craigie burger lacked the ooMph\nand finally the profiteroles while delicious didn't make me want more than a bite.\n\nI want to like Craigie (I want to be like everyone else daymnit!) , but honestly, if I am going to spend this money, I'd go elsewhere."]
["It's difficult to laud praises that are informative for a restaurant that already has shedloads of well-earned praise for doing so many things so write.  But they so deserve it.  We were greeted by a most lovely hostess who actually remembered our phone conversation when she'd called to confirm my reservation.  In particular, my interest in Craigie On Main's not-so-secret-limited-edition-each-night burgers.  We got two of them.  But before we got there, we started with a cheese plate.  Goat's milk cheese, cow's milk cheese, sheep's milk cheese, with  accompanying almonds, candied orange peel, and a blueberry jam.  Simply amazing cheeses.  Then came our burgers.  They were massive.  Mine was topped with a fried egg (because of course you top it with a fried egg!), and my kid had his with bacon.  Not gonna lie - the burger was so huge it had trouble staying together.  The fried egg made mine a little messier than usual.  But that didn't matter.  Short of the Minetta Tavern's Black Label burger, this was easily one of the greatest burgers I'd ever had.  Done, nuff said.  The other dishes we ordered were incredible, too.  Pasta rolled in a savory sauce made with boudin noir?  So rich and hearty.  One day I'll have to try other things on the menu.  But those burgers are gonna be hard to pass up."]
['One of the best rated restaurants in all of Boston (and for good reasons). The ambiance is high end but sweet and cozy, and the service staff is extremely attentive and top notch. The plating of the food is a treat in itself, extraordinarily beautiful and simply elegant. The food is very savory, their Fois Gras appetizer is one of the best I have ever tasted, a specialty, bone marrow butter - where inside of the bone marrow is melted and can be spread on bread is one of their most recommended dishes. We also had the perfectly cooked Swordfish and Sirloin is superb. The pecan pie ice cream - oh my god, so delicious. The proportions are perfect for the contrast of warm and cold, smooth texture of the ice cream with the bread texture of the pie. Very expensive but you get your money worth.']
["Exquisite and expensive!\nYes, this is the place of the moment. It's very, very fine.  And excels at what it aims to do. Service is excellent, even on the hectic Saturday night prime time when I was dining.  Overall, very well done.  I would challenge them to produce what they do a more reasonable price point (which would still be quite expensive)."]
['One of the best meals of my life. Highly recommend.']
["I went here again with my husband after reading about their Chef's Whim tasting menu. We had a six course tasting menu.  There were no written menus, so each dish came out as a surprise.  The servers were very knowledgeable about the different dishes and the preparation required for each.  I can't remember all the names of things we had, but I was a big fan of pork two ways, one way being a rib sous vide for 12 hours in and then fried to order.  We also enjoyed salmon, fried sweetbreads, and the desserts.  One of the desserts was a malt ice cream with chocolate cake( or brownie?) with peanuts and sauce.  So delicious!  \n\nI knocked down a star just because every time I was done with a course, I wanted more!  Truly gave me a taste of what Craigie has to offer."]
["Chef's Table: Awesome opportunity to the see the chefs at work. Best as a reservation for two people since talking in a line of four is kind of ridiculous. \n\nChef's Whim: 6 Courses\n\nCons: Salt masked 2 / 6 of the dishes\n\nPros:  Fried rib and 24 hour cooked pork belly = MOUTHGASM. \n\nFantastic cocktails. \n\nIt's restaurants like this that make me happy going out to eat doesn't have to be about pouring butter on a piece of fish. Although I'm fine with that too."]
['Pluses: Service, Stripped bass entre, tomato side dish\nMinuses: Bread (expected better from a french restauraurant), tuna appetizer (cooked and tasted like canned), poor ventllation (kitchen fumes were choking dining area at times)\nOK  Expected to be wowed based on all the reviews.']
["I'm giving four stars; 5 for atmosphere and 3 for food.  Really great site but the food just didn't do it for us.  Why? One of us ordered a pork belly strip that was more fat than pork.  I order a tilefish.  It was ok but nothing fantastic, just kind of plain and average.  Cooked fine but not much taste in the whole dish. I did order a side of polenta and, while super rich, it was very good.  In the end, the banana bread pudding was good but nothing over the top."]
["Wow.  Went for the Chef's Whim and the experience was amazing in ever facet.  Each course (opted for the four course option; there is a six course offering too) was delicious.  The carpaccio was perfect and drizzled in a delicious citrus sauce.  The hake was cooked to perfection and complimented very well with a spinach purée.  The chicken was tender and divine.  Lastly the chocolate cake and citrus based cake were  awesome and complimented one another surprisingly well. \n\nService was prompt and fantastic.   Drinks are strong and very good.  \n\nI will return.  \n\nJust a heads up - the Chet's whim changes every week apparently so don't expect the same courses.  Regardless I have the utmost confidence in any course they put in front of you."]
['Went there for dinner with a couple of friends. Food was decent but overpriced. Good quality but nothing to eve about.']
["I and my family had dinner at the place. Few unsatisfactory.  First, when we arrived, the entrance was locked(I don't get it why it would be locked!) no one open it for us until we walk around to try the different door.  Second, when we were waiting to be seated, I saw a chef who's used a spoon to taste the food and stir right back in with the same spoon! At least I'm not comfortable with it. THIRD!  We were only could order one side of the menu for the table. Which I do get it it's easy for time controlling. But I was disappoint with the set menu that I was surprised!  I was served yellowtail sashimi, tempura soft shell crab and stuff!  I CAN HAVE JAPANESE FOOD AT JAPANESE CUISINE. WHY WOULD I PAY HIGHER PRICE TO GET WORSE JAPANESE FOOD AT A FRENCH RESTAURANT!    The most satisfy part was the waitress was nice. But maybe the wine could come before the food."]
["Nice restaurant but very expensive for what you get. Had the chicken for two and it was excellent, but being honest I have to say I was only moderately impressed. Service was a bit slow as well. Waitress was very nice but brought us an app we didn't order and when we pointed that out she took it away but still charged us for it. A bit bush league."]
['I came here to celebrate a very special occasion with a party of 7.  We emailed with Karin, who is in charge of larger parties, and she was pleasant and very accommodating.  \n\nOn the night of the dinner, we had the 6 course Craigie experience.  Our first course was 3 types of fish, cured and smoked, including the smoked bluefish rillete.  Second course was lobster, and the lobsters were cooked to perfection--tender.  Our  third course was the fish course.  This time, the slow cooked Tazmanian trout.  It was the best tasting fish of some people\'s lives as it was proclaimed this evening.  Our pasta course and pork 3 ways were great as well.  The final course was dessert and we had 4 different types of dessert among 7 people.  So we were able to share and taste each other\'s dessert.\n\nThe service here is impeccable as always.  Your bread basket and water glass will never be empty.  And each course came in seamlessly so our conversation was never interrupted.  \n\nOne of the highlights was that Chef Tony Maws came and introduced our meat course, so some of us had "fanboy" moments.  And because it was a special occasion, they wrote a congratulatory plate in raspberry (I think) sauce for us.\n\nCraigie is always a place that I go for an important event in my life.  And they always deliver.']
['The one thing I really want to make clear in this review is that dinner at Craigie on Main is fun!  It was an absolute blast.  The menu is like a culinary safari with some things that I\'ve never seen before on a menu.  For example, you can get fried pig tails as an appetizer, cock\'s comb (you know, the rooster mohawk thing) and braised bone marrow.  \n\nThis was probably the best meal I\'ve ever had.  I started with mushroom ragout, had the pork three ways as an entree and ended with the homemade sorbet.  I never knew that pork could taste so good.  The entree was served as pork rib, pork confit and braised pork belly.  I feel like all of the other pork dishes I\'ve ever eaten was just not cooked right or completely sub par.  Quote of the night from my girlfriend: "I didn\'t know food could taste like this."\n\nOh and let me tell you about the service.  Awesome!  Our waitress was super attentive without being over bearing and she even came through with some great drink recommendations for my lady.  \n\nMake sure you check your bankroll before going though because you\'ll be dropping at least 2 bills on dinner for two.']
["Craigie exceeded my expectations. I can see why it gets all the hype that it does.  That being said...the meal wasn't perfect but the that's me being rather picky.  We were a party of three that sat at the bar (we walked in without a reservation on a Sat at 5:30).  The ambiance was great. The service was stellar. My cocktail was one of the best cocktails I've had in a while. I got the Mellow Yellow..it was very well-executed. The bartender was working the bar very well.  For food we got the octopus appetizer, the burger, and the pig's head (for two).  My favorite was the octopus appetizer. The burger was very good but I'm not sure if I'd say it was the best burger I've ever had.  The pig's head was rather fatty...not as meaty as others that I had.  For a $72 half's a pig's head..I ate everything...fat and all...and it was a lot of fat.  I regret doing that just a bit.  The main gripe though with the hoisin served with it....texture was off..it was rather grainy in texture...you can taste the flour or corn starch or something in it.  And they did not give us enough of the bean sprouts and pumpkin sambal.  Still..given all of that...Craigie deserves 5 stars.  It's definitely a place you must try!"]
['I ordered the chicken entree here which was stuffed with chicken sausage and it was delicious.The cocktails are really good too. Some of the items are the menu were a little out there for me, so this place is probably better for those with adventurous tastes. I would like to try the burger sometime.']
['My boyfriend wanted to go here forever, but he kept putting it off because he was worried they would not have enough options for me (because I am a vegetarian).  I always find something to eat, so I was not worried, but not expecting anything amazing.\n\nI arrived about 25 minutes before my boyfriend, he was late leaving work, and the waitress did not mind my sitting at the table having a glass of wine while I waited.  It was a definite plus that I did not have to wait at the bar alone.\n\nIt is one of my favorite meals in Boston so far, partially because my boyfriend was so happy to finally be eating there, and because we BOTH had such great meals.  Definitely a priority if you are in Boston for only a short time, and should be high on your list if you live here.']
['This is truly one of the greatest restaurants, meals and values for great food I have found in the country ... I am from dc and travel a bunch for great food ... The breakfast hash is one of the most elegant dishes I have had ... And the pork creponettes were solid ... Fu vibe\n\nNote ... Donuts are away overrated cake donuts .....']
["This place really didn't impress me. Maybe if there wasn't so much hype, and I didn't have such high expectations as it was my birthday dinner, it would have been fine, but over all... just eh. The food was uninspiring, and my drink was pretty bland.  It could have just been an off night for the menu, as I understand it changes daily. But if I ever go back (and that's a big if, it's a bit pricey to be so unimpressive) I definitely wouldn't order fish again. \n\nI would have given it two stars, but I must say, the waitstaff was tremendous. Very attentive to detail, and gave me a replacement cocktail when they noticed I didn't like the one I had (the replacement wasn't any better, but I appreciated the effort)."]
["Maybe I was expecting too much...but the tasting menu wasn't worth the $$$.  When and IF I EVER go back there, I WILL NOT choose their multi course Chef's menu.  \n\nBy they way, I got sick when I got home and the toliet was my friend for the night!"]
['I have been dying to try it here for years - and finally went with some friends last evening and was unfortunately very dissapointed.\n\nFirst - they need to PUBLICIZE that you cannot get the burger in the dining room. They should absolutely know that this is what they are most famous for. I recognize it costs  much less than their entrees (more on that later) but we didn\'t know and that was really the only reason I wanted to go.  I also think this is an absolutely ABSURD policy to begin with and I find it rude.  I do give them props for trying to make it up to us by finding space in the bar...then when we couldn\'t move they brought us free samples of the soup and hot chocolate at the end of the night.  Though something tells me this was more a direct result of me putting on Twitter my frustration as it was happening than their flawless manners.\n\nAnother issue I have - I have heard rants and raves about the food - the menu isn\'t very large or accessible - and everything I tasted was GROSSLY overpriced for what it was in my opinion.  I ordered the Cod and found it good, don\'t get me wrong I ate it, but I probably could have made that myself. It wasn\'t anything special and I would have asked for pepper since there wasn\'t any on the table to try to boost the flavor but felt I was already on their sh*t list.\n\nI will say that the Matrie d was adorable and VERY nice. I found him genuine and apologetic.  I also loved the second waitress we were given by the end - she had excellent recommendations on wine.  By the way our first waitress seemed very new...we couldn\'t hear a word she said and she was so awkward but she was quickly replaced without us saying anything.\n\nOverall really not what I was hoping for - less inclined to head back to try this "famous" burger after I found the rest of the menu rather odd and my dish pretty blah. We will see.']
['I guess I\'ll start by saying, I wish nothing but success for the team at Craigie on Main. It\'s clear that they\'re passionate about what they do and are definitely doing something right. Maybe it just wasn\'t for me.\n\nThe evening was a date-night with the lady...something that was long overdue. She had made the original reservations, after reading about the $40 chef\'s tasting. Unfortunately, she missed the part where it\'s only offered after 9 PM and our reservations were for 8 PM. When tried to push the reservation back, we were told that they were completely booked. Nevertheless we changed our mindset and decided to go for a splurge of a dinner.\n\nWe started with two wonderful cocktails. Our waitress recommended Ardoise for the lady while I got the Northern Lights, which was a lovely riff on a Sazerac. Additionally, the service was impeccable the whole night, glasses always full, everyone really chipping in to make sure we always had the appropriate flatware, etc.\n\nThe fish amuse was bluefish pate topped with some black roe...a great way to start the meal with a bright brininess that was pleasantly jarring.\n\nThe mrs.\'s starter was quite nice...a trio of pates with a palette of accompaniments, violet mustard, cornichons etc. Great execution.\n\nMy octopus, on the other hand, was underwhelming. While it was super tender, I felt it was under seasoned and the chorizo sauce was decidedly ordinary. It lacked any kick, smokiness, or richness that I was anticipating.\n\nOur mains followed a similar pattern, with my other-half again ordering the better dish. Her rib eye was easily the best piece of red-meat we\'ve had in Boston. It\'s more memorable than anything we\'ve had at Capital Grille or Grill 23. I only wish I knew how they seasoned the extra tender meat, it was a mix of sweetness and earthiness that was really well balanced.\n\nMy trio of pork, confit + pork belly + rib had a few wonderful elements, but also had some missteps. It had a decidedly Asian flair, accompanied  with the bok choy side with pickled Chinese mustard greens that was slightly soggy. While I appreciate the nod to my peeps, it seemed, out of place on a fine-dining plate. Furthermore, the confit showed up cold and the pork belly was unmemorable. I much preferred the pork belly served as a side at the brunch at Jose Garces\'s Tinto. Craigie\'s didn\'t have that same balance of the sinfully oozing fat melding with the lean meat. I guess it was too dry, which was odd for a piece of pork belly. However, the fried pork rib was outstanding. The prominent sweet flavors reminded me of Chinese sausage.  It was a real treat, probably tying with the cocktails as the highlight of my meal. (The rib eye takes 1st place in the overall competition).\n\nThen came desserts. My apricot torte with amaretto ice cream and pistachios was, so so. The alcohol from the amaretto didn\'t pair well with the sour apricot sauce and both overpowered the pistachios. My girlfriend\'s buttermilk ice cream with strawberries and shortcake was also a little off the mark. The buttermilk ice cream by itself was way too sour. However, when all of the components of the dish were taken together in one bite, it was like you were eating a frosty strawberry cheesecake. \n\nUnfortunately (and unfairly so), I\'m still reeling two days later from the angel food cake with mascarpone gelato, nut florentine and strawberry coulis from Sibling Rivalry (the nutinees of the florentine really elevated the entire dish and added a wonderful contrast in texture to the spongy cake). The mellow tartness of the marscapone was much better at tying everything on the plate together than the cloyingly sourness of the buttermilk ice cream.  \n\nIndependent of the food, the night was slightly marred by the open-kitchen concept. There was a pervasive undercurrent of stress throughout the restaurant. Flashes of rolling eyes and exacerbated sighs from various staffers underlies the exterior of a tightly run ship.  While a small part of me enjoys watching Gordon Ramsay faking aneurysms at "cheftants" who have been exploitatively miscast for his punching pleasure, it\'s not so fun in real life. \n\nI understand that\'s the reality of running a successful kitchen. While the chef tonight was no where near that level of verbal abuse, I lost count of the number of times, "Matty!" or "Runner! I need a runner!" interrupted our conversation. I think the highlight was, "O-K. What does that spell?  Okay!" I guess it\'s not fair to sit in ivory towers, choosing instead to hide our heads in the sand, but snarky condescension can still put a real a damper on a meal.  \n\nLastly, when we left at 10 PM, there were two 2-tops, a 4-top, and 80% of the bar by the kitchen still open. Maybe they limit the # of discounted tastings, but we couldn\'t shake the feeling of slightly mislead.\n\nBottom line: 2 nights ago, we had a 3 course meal (2 apps, 1 app + 1 entree, 1 split dessert, 2 drinks) at a similarly celebrated South End restaurant...for less than 1/2 the $.']
["Truly a 5-star experience &amp; a perfect way to end our Boston trip. \n\nWe lucked out and ended up at the chef's table (some silly couple canceled their \nreservation for the evening)--but their loss was our gain! \n\nLovely &amp; attentive staff, and really inventive and delicious food. \n\nWe tried the tasting menu and enjoyed every single bite. \n\nIt isn't worth listing the courses, as they change depending on the season/evening...but there wasn't one single miss. They also happily accommodated some allergy issues and produced a particularly delicious gluten free dessert option. \n\nIf we lived nearby, I think this would be our go-to special occasion restaurant."]
['Accommodating! Very accommodating.. This is not a trait you find at swanky places that could easily be snooty and dismissive, but they\'re not! They\'re very nice at Craigie, \n\nWe came ready to sit at the bar, have some bar food and a couple cocktails, and it was completely packed. We waited around awkwardly and it was only a few moments before the bartender approached us, and perched us on a counter near the bar. He gave us drink menus and made us feel more at ease. He, like any great bartender should, was able to recommend great drinks based on our preferences. He was also nice enough to make me a great drink not on the menu (Corpse Reviver No 2). Ultimately, he got us a place to sit, and our food was brought to us momentarily.\n\nUh, fried pig tails? I had never heard of this before. And my curiosity got the best of me. I had to try it. And as the bartender described "you have to get messy and get right in it." Pretty true. You\'ll have to use your hands to eat them, but they\'re pretty tasty. Good bar food to go with your alcohol. Good amount of heat, perfect amount of crisp, and the peanuts and garlic go real well with it.\n\nI also tried the seasonal sparkler (can\'t remember what it\'s called.) I\'d say it was a bit on the dense side, but still delicious nonetheless. A very sweet, autumn spice taste at first, and a very bitter ending. Great drink.\n\nI wish I lived in Cambridge so I could come to Craigie more often.']
['I\'ve been to Craigie On Main twice, and I live in L.A.  I don\'t think I\'ll ever visit Boston without trying to get a meal here.  It\'s one of the best restaurants I\'ve ever visited, and I was as happy with my dinner as I was with the brunch in my previous review.\n\nWe arrived early for our reservation and had a drink while we waited.  There wasn\'t a great place to do this, but the staff did their best to keep us comfortable.  I had a disappointing cocktail.  It was $12 and had a preposterous name (Nature of Nurture), so I expected some craft.  Made with hibiscus tea and flower-steeped London dry, Domaine de Canton, Grand Marnier, maple, and sparkling wine, it was overly sweet and medicinal.  As we drank, we saw a burger go by, and for that reason we decided to eat in the bar room rather than our table in the main dining area.  It was a comfortable space, more casual and tavern-like than the other side.  Service throughout the meal was attentive and friendly.\n\nThe food was stellar.  We got started with a nice warm basket of bread, nothing too fancy but certainly good.  There was one wheaty variety studded with sunflower seeds that took the win.  Then we ordered.  With four people, all family, we shared two prix fixe menus and got a couple entrees a la carte.  It was a perfect attack plan.\n\nThe prix fixe is not really a deal, but if you\'re going to get an appetizer, entree, and dessert, you might as well get the amuse bouche and paired dessert wine for a total of $75.  The whole table doesn\'t have to participate, so sharing is good, and you can order your priciest items prix fixe.\n\nWe had a choice of three amuses, of which we tried two.  Both were hard but not impossible to share, and they were excellent.  A chewy squid "pasta" with nuoc pham and tiny sliced radish offered a ton of flavor and a fun novel texture.  Cured goose breast pastrami with pickled okra, carrots, and corn was tasty even in shreds.\n\nThe appetizers were superb.  The grilled Spanish octopus was tender and meaty, and it delivered a fantastic tomato depth of flavor.  It was served with grilled ciollini onion, fresh hearts of palm and lemon salad, and a savory chorizo sauce.  House-made black pepper straccetti pasta with house-cured ham and Peekytoe crab ragout was another wonder, with a strong wheat flour taste to the al dente pasta and great texture from the crab.\n\nI often find that entrees at nice restaurants break the promises made by strong appetizers - not the case at Craigie.  We got fish, steak, vegetables, and a burger, and every one was delicious.  The line-caught tautog a la plancha was phenomenal, a luscious, fatty cut of fish served with toothsome Wellfleet and razor clams, whelks, mussels, and a cardoon puree.  All-natural hangar steak a la Poele was cooked a perfect tender pink.  It came with a sweet beef tongue ragout and spinach, prunes, almonds, and a parsnip tsimmes laced with sweet potato, date, spices, and a lot of comforting flavor.  Craigie can do beautiful things without meat, as shown by a glacée of early spring farm vegetables.  This was an artful medley of beet, asparagus, broccoli, white and purple cauliflower, peas, and more, served alongside a stripe of parsnip puree, spring ramp coulis, and walnut oil, and a heap of five grain and mushroom pilaf.  There were a lot of things going on, but the result was harmonious, with earthy flavors and some definite heft.  And finally, that burger, which was only available on the bar side.  It was a simple burger with Vermont cheddar and crispy onions, and it came with fries, lightly dressed greens, mace ketchup, red wine pickles, and a Southern slaw, all on the side.  The meat had an even fine grind that cooked to a beautiful soft medium rare, and it oozed juice.  The bun did its job and the cheese and onions were just right.  The ketchup and pickles made the burger even better, and I even liked the fat potato wedges, a type of fry I rarely favor, thanks to their significant crispy outsides.\n\nCraigie does not skimp on portions, and we were full by dessert.  Even so, we made quick work of what we ordered, as well as the wine pairings.  I had the sour milk panna cotta at brunch and wanted it again, this time with coriander-cashew granola, dried cherry and kirsch purée, and brown butter.  It was ridiculous, with a lush thick texture and an irresistible tang.  The granola added great crunch, but I could\'ve eaten the pure panna cotta on its own, out of a bucket.  It was paired with a sweet white wine, a golden glass of Sainte-Croix-du-Mont.  The bourbon pecan ice cream tart was almost as good, a hefty slice of pecan ice cream topped with soft chocolate, sitting on a subtly salty bacon pecan crust.  A crunchy crumble and smoked Mexican salt chocolate sauce finished the plate, and it paired well with a bold cuvée.\n\nThe meal ended with some almond rochere clusters, which were quickly replaced when we polished them off.  Like everything else at Craigie, they were just about perfect.']
['Reserve Ringside Brunch. \nWitness the artistry and meticulousness.  \n\nEverything was soooo good.  Try the beef cheek hash and pork belly!']
['See blog for full review:\n\nWalking in to Craigie on Main I must admit I was hesitant; as a matter of fact, for the sake of full disclosure I\'ll note that until Chef Tony Maws won the Beard Award for Best Chef Northeast one month earlier I\'d been ignoring suggestions to add Craigie to my agenda largely because the menu simply seemed too much like everything else trendy out there these days - offal this, local-regional that, and nose-to-tail porkcentricity.  Rarely one to question trusted palates in the cities I visit it was in fact the Beard Award (and particularly who he beat out) that forced me to reconsider my decision and after a week or so of watching the restaurant\'s social media feed I decided to give it a go.\n\nWith the room mostly heavy woods and brick plus some off white wallpaper juxtaposing the white tablecloths and quality service ware I actually liked the feel of Craigie save for one thing - the music which when combined with the open kitchen and room full of graduates, families, and parties was one of the loudest I\'ve ever experienced.   \n\nSeated for approximately 5 minutes before Joseph, my captain for the evening, would arrive my water was filled (and kept nearly filled to the brim throughout) and a menu was delivered by a young woman.  With the menu divided into a la carte options, a six course, and a ten course I asked a few questions (largely to make sure that the main course was not beef and that a copy could be provided) and Joseph explained to me that the way the ten course worked was he would ask if there was anything I really liked and/or didn\'t want and the chef would craft it from there; thinking this sounded ideal and noting my likes and dislikes I opted for the ten course and things were underway.  With the two-top next to me notably requesting the six course (hard not to eavesdrop when everyone is yelling over the din of the room) and the table of six to my left opting for the ten course I will note that although the restaurant was busy service was quite good throughout and descriptions of each dish were detailed - but save for a couple of items it really didn\'t seem like the tasting was tailored at all.\n\nWith the room still loud but starting to fade as the hour approached 9:30 the check was delivered along with two small macarons described as "Chocolate Almond Tobacco" and although their dry texture was not ideal the flavor was certainly intriguing.  Also delivered with the check was a comment card, something I always take the time to fill out whether good or bad but especially in this case as it came with check-boxes a long note from Chef Maws requesting feedback.  Of course, since Joseph had also forgotten to pass along word of my desire for a printed menu I had a good fifteen minutes to fill out the card and as such became rather wordy - mostly praise but also noting that while some dishes shined others disappointed, especially in the setting of a "ten course menu" when four courses could have been served as amuses or palate cleansers rather than proper courses.\n\nHaving now been up for nearly twenty hours I settled my bill and with menu in hand I made my way to the door where my bags were gathered and within moments I found myself in a cab en route for the South End.  Having spent a good portion of the day eating I most certainly was not hungry, but at the same time I also wasn\'t terribly satisfied with my visit to Craigie on Main either.  Sure some of the courses were good - as a matter of fact, some were excellent - but for $150+ I tend to expect more from a Beard Award winning chef...and when I returned home to Ohio perhaps I found out just what I should have expected and received in the form of an apology and offer from Marjorie Maws stating "...of course we\'re upset that you weren\'t blown away by our food. Here\'s a possible explanation (but definitely not an excuse.). You came in at a time when there are lots of out of town visitors who are here for one of the many graduations in the area. We learned a few years ago that many of these diners were not as adventurous as our local crowd and so we made the menu a little more "normal" for a couple of weeks. We do, however, still have several "funky" preparations available and our servers are instructed to ask where each party is on the "funk scale." It sounds like that may not have happened in your case and, if that\'s true, we are terribly sorry.  May I offer you a gift certificate for a return visit to Craigie so that you can enjoy our full range of our selections? Again our apologies and we really appreciate your feedback. We can\'t wait to cook for you again!"\n\nWhile I can\'t say my first visit to Craigie on Main was my best in Boston all things being equal I\'d definitely be willing to give anyplace that classy a second chance and on my next visit to the North East I shall.']
["The place is nice, so does their service.\nWe had 8-course tasting menu and  everything is good. \nThey also gave us sorbet before last dish(dessert), it's an addition and free service.\n\nMy favorite one is the trout which was cooked so perfect and come with their house chowder. They are cooked, but tasted like medium rare.....  so tender and fresh."]
["This was totally my lucky week, because I ate at Craigie's twice. The first time I was at the bar. My friends had the special burger and said it was to die for; I stole their fries and I don't know how you can make a fry extraordinary, but Craigie did. The cocktails were amazing; like Drink, it's the kind of place where you can tell them in general terms what you're in the mood for, and they will improvise something delightful. The Northern Lights cocktail on the menu was tangy, light, yet complex--recommended.\n\nFor the second trip, I took some business partners there for dinner. I had some trepidations because one is a foodie who divides his time between NYC and Paris--so what in Boston can possibly compete? Yet both my guests hugely enjoyed their dinners of steak, octopus, pork, and squash with duck fat.\n\nYes, there is a lot of meat here, but they are veg-friendly too! I had noted in my Open Table reservation that I'm vegan, and Craigie treated me not like an annoying minority, but like a VIP. LOVE THEM! Upon arriving at the restaurant they told me the chefs had conocted a special creamy broccoli soup (smooth, herbal, and divine) AND a special dessert: coconut-based affogato, which I still have swooning memories of. Craigie seems happy to accomodate dietary issues/allergies if you notify them in advance. I was blown away by the special treatment. Totally OTT in a really nice way.\n\nService was extraordinary and efficient. I had been to Craigie when it was on Craigie St. and it was good, but in its new location it is superb."]
["Came here with reservations for 3 and we got seated immediately.  I am giving this place 4 stars only because the service was excellent and I enjoyed the overall experience BUT the food was just alright.  Let me explain.\n\nSome things going for the restaurant was the service as I mentioned above.  They have a row of tables that seats up to 4.  The waitress poured 2 glasses of water on one side, then walked all the way around to the other side to pour the last glass just so she didn't have to reach over the table.  I thought that was above and beyond what she needed to do.  They give a little more than enough for each portion.  Especially when you compare to it NYC, they give more BUT it doesn't taste as good as some of the NYC restaurants for similar or equal pricing, hence the 4 stars and only recommending to come here once and not again.  This restaurant might be the most sophisticated food in town, then I understand why a lot of people gave this place 5 stars.  If it were to stand up against restaurants in NYC, I think it would be around 3.75 rating.\n\nIn any case, onto the food.  \n1st course, we ordered: Crispy Fried Pig's Tails, Grilled Spanish Octopus, and Lamb shank pasta\nThe pig tails was delicious but overly salty for my taste, my companions thought the salt content was just right.  The flavor profile is more asian/thai mix.  The meat was tender but there are some small bones.  The waitress recommended using my hands to eat it, but a fork was just fine and much more civilized.  I would recommend this dish.\nThe spanish octopus in my opinion lacked seasoning.  You got the full tenticles.  Because it was the entire length with varying thickness, the ends of the tenticles were burnt and that ruined my taste buds.  I would recommend preparing the tenticles differently so everything is evenly cooked.  The thicker portions of the tenticles were tender though.  They didn't make it rubbery or chewy, I'll give them that much.\nThe lamb shank pasta was flavorful.  I wish they gave more of the sauce/broth.  The sauce/broth had deep lamb flavors to it.  Absolutely lovely.  Reminded me of a bolognese sauce.  I would recommend this dish.  Earthy flavors to the dish.\n\n2nd course we ordered:\nTor Tor fish? of the day (don't remember what it's called, ugly fish head which is dis proportioned to the rest of the body), Venison, and beef brisket (forgot the full description).\nThe fish did not complement the red beets at all.  Didn't go well together and didn't taste good.  My assumption is that they tried to use the beets to cover up some of the fish taste.  It didn't work.  I think the fish would have worked with just seasoning and pan frying it.  Then combine it with a liquid sauce, maybe an earthy type of sauce.\nThe venison was cooked to perfection.  Loved the marble meat.  Definitely enough pieces on the dish if you want to share.  Flavors went well together, quite a heavy dish.  \nThe beef brisket was decent.  Lots of sauces and it was basically a well season brisket, nothing spectacular.  But I preferred the venison much more.  \n\n3rd course we ordered:\nBanana Millefeuille, Apricot tort, and Cajet Creme Caramel.\nLoved the millefeuille, lots of banana flavor and the glazed sugar over the banana on top really added to the dish.  \nThe apricot dish was presented beautifully but it's on the tarty side.  I think if you just ate the apricot with the ice cream and pistachio without that yellow gel on the dish, it would taste a lot better.\nThe cajet creme caramel was decent as well, but it was my least favorite out of the 3.  If you don't like kumquat, then you won't like the dish.  The kumquat just didn't complement the other components, the flavors from the kumquat was just too strong.  I think they should have just made it a powerful dessert dish.  \n\nOverall, decent meal but I would only go once."]
['Went their a couple of times and most recently for the New Year brunch.\nThe food is very good and consistent.\nGreat flavor and quality.\nOnly downside for the (one off) NY brunch was a slight disappointment with the Tuna tartar and sturgeon caviar , the overall taste was dominated by a very fishy taste and the consistency reminded me a little bit too much of canned tuna. But than again I may have been spoiled having been to O Ya for the dinner the evening before :)\n\nI think I prefer to go there for their evening tasting menu as it gives you a much better experience and exposure to their capabilities.\nCraigie is famous for their use of bone marrow so if you go for dinner you certainly should consider their bone marrow burger. \nWaiters are friendly and efficient. A little sterile for my liking , not much personal interaction and seemed to be not very keen on offering suggestions/ideas.\nThe only gripe I have was that they have not been able to offer a skim late or sweetner (I know this  not the place to be carb/calorie cautious but being diabetic I still want to be good in some areas :)  ) .']
['Tried a roasted veal sandwich, AND IT WAS AMAZING!\nInteresting, interesting place!']
["My only complaint about Craigie is that I wish it was closer to Brookline, because this was one of my favorite dining experiences I've had since moving to Boston five years ago.\n\nMy fiancee made reservations--months in advance--at the chef's table for my birthday.  We started out with a cocktail at the bar.  I ordered the Civilian, a mezcal based drink featuring Thai chiles, which boasted incredible flavor.  The bar area, and the restaurant as a whole, is no-nonsense, and all craft, from the bartending to the atmosphere to the service. \n\nOur meal at the chef's table was enlightening.  Watching this team of professionals turn out such delicious, enticing food so rapidly was a pleasure to watch.  It was no surprise that the food was so delicious.\n\nMy fiancee and I both ordered the Prix Fixe menu for $65.  For starters, I recommend the Sashimi, which just wows the palate.  The octopus was delicious too.  For the main, go with the pork three ways, featuring suckling confit, spice crusted rib, and grilled pork belly.  The rib really shines.  For an extra $10, a side of bone marrow is a MUST.  I had never eaten bone marrow before, and this dish was a revelation.  We finished the meal quite nicely with Banana Millefeuille and a selection of house sorbets -- can't go wrong with either.\n\nThe service was excellent throughout the meal -- attentive and informative without being overbearing.  Craigie is a wonderful place to eat a delicious meal.  For a special occasion, a trip to the chef's table is a delight.\n\nCraigie just does things right, which is why we'll be back, hopefully soon to sit in the bar area and try that famous burger of theirs."]
["I came here with my husband for their tasting menu, and we were not disappointed.  It was a fantastic meal, and all things considered, the price was very reasonable for the quality of the food and dining experience.\n\nThe tasting menu as we had it was 9 courses, and they did not provide us a menu before, but asked if there were any specific tastes or flavors we saw on the standard menu that we wanted to incorporate.  I found that to be unusual, but lovely.  We specifically mentioned we wanted to try the bone marrow and the pig's head.  Oddly as we looked at the menu forming, we noticed we were eating a large quantity of milk-fed animals... a lesser person would have found it disconcerting, but I assure you it was all delicious!\n\nThe pig's head meat was fantastic... very tender with crisp skin (eat it there, do not attempt to eat this later at home...), and the Peking duck treatment was great.  The bone marrow was very good, but I've had a lot of great bone marrow. This one wasn't a magical standout. The ingredient is going to always be good unless it's massacred.\n\nThe fish dishes struck me as being excellent.  Delicate enough to taste the quality of the fish, and a nice balance of textures and flavors.  We had a veal dish, and a young goat dish as well, and both were top notch. \n\nI appreciated their service as well. It was there if you needed them, never hovering, casual, informative, and friendly.  They asked us about our wine pairings, and tailored each again to the food and our palates. My husband and I each had different wines, and they were all suited well to the food, but even more so to each of us. Had I had his wines, the experience wouldn't have been nearly as good, and vice versa. All in all, the next time I'm in Boston, I'll be back."]
["I am certainly not in the five-star club here about Craigie...not even the burger, to be honest.\n\n4 stars? Absolutely.  4.5? yeah, maybe.  But 5 stars? I just don't understand what makes this a five-star place over somewhere like, say, Bondir or Asta on the high-end.\n\nMaybe Craigie is a victim of its own hype, destined to be a letdown to those who have built it up so much?  Maybe my changing tastes and my newfound appreciation for price-to-value scrutiny have left me unable to 5-star this famous restaurant.\n\nNow, that said, hyped? Sure. Still incredible? Absolutely.\n\nYes, there are plate-swooshes and formal service and multi-courses and hefty-price-tags, but at least it's cozier than L'Espalier and smaller/more quaint than Menton.  You must still wear your Sunday-best (well, you don't have to, but when going to a nice, expensive restaurant, get rid of the jeans, will ya?  You're ruining it for everyone else), but you'll be very at-ease in this bustling, loud, busy, small dining room...even more so if you sit at a table overlooking the open kitchen.\n\nThere are three experiences here, all of which I recommend, and all of which have their rightful place in the community.\n\n1. Sunday brunch.  If you do this route, sit at the aforementioned seats facing the kitchen.  It's laid back, it's fun to watch the chefs run around back there, and let's be honest...brunch is an unpretentious and informal meal.  Order a bloody mary (they make theirs with gin, thank God) and tuck into a plate of duck confit hash for the long-haul\n\n2. Burger at the bar.  The rumors are true - they only make like 20 per day, only serve these suckers at the bar, and there is ALWAYS a line to get in at 5:00pm to have one.  Go early, line up, sit at the bar, enjoy one of their (small selection, but very expertly chosen) draft beers or a cocktail, order a burger, split with your partner.  Split it?  Yes, split it.  These things are injected with bone marrow (I call that CHEATING, but whatever), topped with bacon, and served, cheesy and delicious, on a fluffy, buttery roll.  It's a rich burger, so tackling one on your own is aggressive.  The fries?  Skip-em.  They're too thick and greasy on the outside, and any fry-lover would likely turn a nose up to this.  In my opinion, the only real fail of the dish.\n\n3. Dinner in the dining room.  This means dressed up, full-on date, order a bottle of wine and everything.  Take 3 hours, have many courses, drink a little too much and fall into a nice, warm, fuzzy, wine-and-food soaked lull while you laugh, kiss, hold hands with your date across the table like the world around you doesn't exist.  While I was in love with my better-half before he took me here (to settle a bet, no less - a bet I made with him to sucker him into taking me on a date.  Girls are so transparent), by the time we left, I was completely enamored.  There's something about an evening here that does this to ya.  It will be among your fondest memories with your significant other...not because the food is outstanding (it is very good), but because, at Craigie, they create a whole experience of touches, tastes, sounds, smells, and a visual that will knock your socks off."]
["My husband and I have visited Craigie several times in the past and we have always loved it, however last Monday's experience (6/8) has solidified Craigie as our favorite restaurant in Boston.  It has even inspired me to write my first Yelp review!\n\nWe made reservations to celebrate our 1 month wedding anniversary (I know, not a traditional milestone, but we make any excuse to have a great meal).  \n\nFOOD: we were hoping to both try to Throwback Bistro menu (45 dollars for 3 courses...we are both residents after all).  Upon arriving, we were informed that they had run out of 1 app and 1 entree from the menu.  We were a little bit disappointed initially and my husband ended up ordering off of the regular menu.  We were both blown away by our meals!  I had the asparagus appetizer, bluefish and chocolate mousse from the discounted menu.  The fish was so delicious, the skin was very flavorful and the fish perfectly cooked.  My husband raved about his chicken and proclaimed it the best chicken he had ever eaten.  The only course that was slightly underwhelming was his pavlova dessert.  We would have appreciated a bit more tart flavor, perhaps a plain or greek yogurt to balance out the sweetness of the meringue.  But altogether amazing food.  And almost forgot, we were given many freebies - a seafood appetizer, a mango sorbet and a grapefruit granita which were all so tasty!\n\nAMBIENCE: lovely as always.  Modern and elegant.  We always ask for seats overlooking the kitchen so we can pretend to be Padma and Tom.\n\nSERVICE: now this is what really blew us away.  The service was fantastic during the meal, our waitress was lovely and attentive, however at the end of the meal, another staff member approached us and apologized for running out of 2 of the prix fixe items.   We reassured her that we were absolutely delighted with our food choices.  On our way out, at the coat check, she presented us with a 45 dollar Craigie gift certificate - the exact cost of the Throwback meal.  Wow.  Thank you Craigie for a wonderful evening!"]
['We were given a gift certificate to visit Craigie and had a nice experience. The menu was unique and the dishes primarily centered around comfort food. I enjoyed the food but it was not "stop in your tracks" delicious. Perhaps my expectations were too high? The service, on the other hand, was wonderful. Our server was very knowledgeable and served the dishes at the perfect tempo. We were enjoying our experience and so we wanted a slower pace and our waitress was able to sense that and present the courses at the appropriate speed. The atmosphere is upbeat and upscale but not too loud. The open kitchen helps enhance the home-style feel of the menu. Overall, we enjoyed the experience but it was just a "nice" night out, nothing that knocked our socks off.']
["I've been to Craigie twice (once for the tasting menu and last night for the burger), and I think it's easily one of the best restaurants in Boston.  Not only is their food incredible, but their service is also on par with what 5* restaurants should aspire to.\n\nLast night we took a group of friends to the bar to try the infamous Craigie burger.  Due to some miscommunication when I called a couple of weeks back, I thought they didn't take reservations in the bar (they do apparently).  The manager was incredibly sympathetic and helpful, and we worked it to split our group into 2 smaller tables.  She kept checking up on us, brought the ladies out a bowl of the brussel sprouts to taste (awesome), and was super attentive even when we were only ordering off of the bar menu.\n\nNow on to the burger: The beef is sourced from Hardwick beef in Western Mass.  It's mixed with miso paste and bone marrow, cooked in a CVap open and quickly charred on a plancha.  It's topped with cheddar, fried onions, and house-made ketchup.  It's served with perfectly seasoned, slightly spicy steak fries.  It's indescribably good, incredibly rich, and quite simply the best burger I've ever tasted.  The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare, stays unbelievably juicy because of the cooking methods, and the bone marrow takes it to the edge of being too rich... without quite getting there.\n\nIt's great to see how versatile Chef Tony Maws truly is... Craigie is known for unique culinary masterpieces, but Maws also can perfect the burger for the bar.  Combine this with awesome service, and you've got Craigie on Main.\n\nTips: For the burger, try to make a reservation at the bar - they apparently have like 4 tables you can reserve.  Otherwise, get there early (they open at 5:30), grab a seat at the bar, and enjoy.  I've heard they run out of burgers, because they only get enough beef for 20-30 per day."]
['My husband recently went to Craigie on Main for the first time for a business dinner. He mentioned to me that he greatly enjoyed the meal and that we should go back sometime. I went online and made us a reservation without doing any further research. \n\nYesterday a few hours before our reservation time I went online and looked at some customer reviews. I nearly cried! I saw people complaining about the cost, about portion size, about snotty service and I thought "Oh no this is not the experience I am looking for at all!" \n\nMy husband and I live about 40 minutes outside of Cambridge and have 3 children that need to stay with a babysitter when we go into the city for a nice meal. We don\'t eat out often and have decided we would rather splurge on a very nice meal once in a while than eat fast food on a regular basis. So for us an evening out really needs to be an enjoyable relaxing and special experience. After reading some very negative reviews I was quite upset that our special night out was going to be a bust.\n\nI was so convinced that we would have an awful time that I would have cancelled our reservation but with it only being a few hours beforehand, already having the babysitter and knowing we wouldn\'t be able to get a reservation anywhere else on a moments notice we decided to take our chance at Craigie.\n\nWe were pleasantly greeted and taken to our table right away. Very shortly after sitting down we were greeted by a cheerful waiter named Rob. Patiently and knowledgeably he answered our questions about both the menu and the drinks list. We decided to do the prix fixe menu which is $67 a person and allows you to have an appetizer, entree and dessert. They brought bread to the table and our appetizers of fried clams and another of linguine came out shortly after. They both were of a very normal size for an appetizer and were delicious. My husband ordered one of the special cocktails and I ordered a locally made farmhouse ale that was fairly new to the menu, both drinks were excellent.\n\nFor our main course I had the Vermont Pork cooked 3 ways which also had red cabbage, barley and mushrooms with it. Again the portion was perfect and all the flavors were a true delight. My husband got the Craigie burger and loved it. For dessert my husband had the 3 flavors of sorbet which were delicate, fresh and full of fresh fruit taste. I had the beignet which is a type of deep fried doughnut which was unbelievably amazing! Warm, crispy on the outside, moist and light on the inside with a light dusting of cinnamon and sugar. \n\nHonestly I cannot come up with even one thing to complain about from our evening at Craigie on Main. I am very picky about service and I thought the waiter, his helper and the manager who I spoke with briefly when he checked to see if our table was enjoying ourselves all were attentive and courteous. \n\nRegarding people\'s complaints regarding portion size I just don\'t know what to say. I have a healthy appetite, I\'m not one of those people who just picks at a salad and I was unable to finish all of my main corse or my dessert. If a diner is looking for the typical american main stream experience that you will get at a place like The Olive Garden or Applebees then yes in comparison you are going to say the portions are small. The plates do not come mounded high with more food than a human should reasonably consume in one meal. But was I left hungry or even wishing that maybe there had been just a little bit more, no absolutely not. In retrospect I wish I had not touched the bread they brought to our table because then I would have been able to finish the rest of my meal which was definitely the best part.\n\nIn respect to price, no it\'s not a cheap meal. I would expect that most people going know that they are going to be spending more on a meal than they might in other places. If you are in need of having a less expensive night out while still enjoying the excellent food offered at Craigie you could have only a main course and dessert or a main course and appetizer only. You could also have no alcohol or just one drink as opposed to many. These options would allow you to enjoy a great meal for less than it would cost if you did the tasting menu. As I mentioned we each had the prix fixe menu option, we had 3 alcoholic drinks and I had a coffee with dessert, before tip our bill was $165. This is within range of other restaurants we have enjoyed dining at in the area.\n\nI very much want to offer other diners an honest review by which to judge this restaurant as I know how helpful it can be when deciding. I walked in the door of Craigie on Main with great trepidation the other night and came out with a full belly, a smile on my face and the memory of a truly excellent dining experience. My husband I would not hesitate to go back or recommend it to friends.']
['Craiggers, I\'m a bit surprised....had dinner like a real grown up person in the restaurant instead of at the bar and it was a letdown. Probably my expectations were too high. I was hoping for transcendent and got just fine.\n\nI had been thinking that my companions and I would go in for a tasting menu, but we were all exhausted and didn\'t think we could do 6 courses, so we just did the pre-fixe. I was in a weird mood and ordered two things I never order-- soup (pumpkin) and chicken (stuffed with chicken sausage).\n\nBut before I go any further about the menu or the food, I need to say this: the bread basket is so perfunctory/terrible that I wish they just hadn\'t brought any bread. I mean, the bread was COLD, colder than room temp.  And not baked on the premises, I\'m pretty sure. The butter was also too cold to be spreadable.  Look, I don\'t advocate filling up on bread before what is meant to be an amazing meal, but I just found it strange that Craigie wouldn\'t try to do something to make the bread not suck so much. The bread basket made the statement that no one should care about the bread basket. It was a mockery of bread baskets and diners who love their free bread.  \n\nNow that that tangent is out of the way, here\'s how the rest of the food went down: pumpkin soup was good, but not amazing. Came with a delicious sliver of grilled cheese and pork belly panini.  It was served with a comically large spoon. Friends got fusilli with confit chicken and veg and the smelts. No rave reviews on either -- but no complaints.  My chicken was very tender and obviously high quality meat -- but there was very little sausage, like a small "ribbon" of it through the breast. And it just wasn\'t that flavorful. I did taste my friend\'s swordfish and thought it was very good -- I probably should have gotten either pork or fish. \n\nWe also shared a side of brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. They were tasty and I love b sprouts, but I couldn\'t really detect the duck fat flavor....which I thought was what was going to make them special/memorable. They smelled amazing, though. \n\nMy panna cotta for dessert was excellent -- light but creamy, and the granola gave it a nice crunch.  \n\nAll in all, nothing was bad, but nothing was stellar. And for what you\'re paying, it should be stellar.']
['This place is what everyone says it is. I would bring friends here, hands down. Our table of 4 ordered the 6-course dinner. 3 of us ordered the "house" dinner while 1 of us ordered the meat-only dinner. All the food was excellent. \n\nThe staff was on-point with everything. All plates were served together and the staffs\' description of the dishes was very detailed; good for us foodies who wonder what ingredients are used! All dishes were cooked very well. We enjoyed the atmosphere and the experience. The pinot was a recommendation by our waitress and went well with all dishes. \n\nThe only downside we thought was the bone marrow. The marrow was prepared beautifully and it was very light in flavor. We were expecting a bolder experience. \n\nThis is a great place for any celebration/occasion.']
['I have been coming to this Cambridge location since it was "La Groceria"... When Craigie had first opened I was very skeptical and sad that the old 30 year old Italian restaurant had closed.\n\nHowever, I must admit I was wrong. Toscanini owner, Gus, suggested me to go try Chef Tony Maws cuisine, and so I did. I was simply blow away. It is one of the most interesting and satisfying culinary experiences I have ever had. Since my first visit I have gone there about 4 times, but it is really hard to get reservations especially in weekends and in 4+ groups.\n\nRecently they became very famous for their burger and the bar, which indeed is very good but is not the best thing that you can get there. The menu changes daily based on what the chef finds on the marker, but some plates are classics. The mushroom ragout, the pumpkin soup, the bone marrow, the pigs head (Yes the real deal) and all the different amazing deserts.\n\nThey also have a great selection of wines and beers especially. Definitely one of my favorite places in MA!']
["Our highly anticipated second visit to Craigie did not disappoint. The food is one of my top dining experiences. This is a great place if you are adventurous in nose-to-tail eating or if you are more conservative in your food choices. \n\nFor the appetizer I had the ragout - which was one of the tastiest things that I've ever eaten. It had cock's comb - something you don't see much of on menus, and it was so meltingly delicious. My entree was the pork three ways - which was what I had last time and it was every bit as tasty as I remembered. The best one was the rib, then the belly, and then lastly the confit. The bf had the sirloin, and it was perfectly tasty. The desserts were great but not the highlight of the meal. \n\nThe only tiny wrinkle on the evening was that the waiter had a slightly condescending attitude, but it was hard to disturb the bliss of an amazing dining experience."]
['Inventive and gourmet but in a laid-back, friendly atmosphere.  Would certainly recommend it for special occasions.']
['Service\n\nI went here for dinner, and signed up for a tasting course. When I first arrived, I was immediately asked if I had a reservation. The restaurant was already full, so I waited about 30 min and was able to get a seat. CALL AHEAD! As I was waiting, I was given an area on the nearby banister / half-height wall, leading down to the bar area. Surprisingly, it wasn\'t that bad. I got a full view of the open kitchen, a hostess ordered a drink for me, and I really enjoyed watching the kitchen staff work.\n\nOur bartender was Jared, and he impressed me the entire night. He clearly had a thorough knowledge of spirits, wine, and food. A rare mix.\n\nCocktails + Wine\n\nOnce my friend arrived, we chatted for a bit. The hostess brought her a cocktail as well, and after a few minutes we were given a seat at the end of the bar. We both started with the "Northern Lights" cocktail, it had St. Germain, Scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki Bitters. We decided to go for the 8 course chef\'s tasting menu, and split it. I\' do tastings once a month, they take 2+ hours to do, and many times it\'s hard for me to actually eat all the food served, so splitting a tasting menu for 1 actually works well for me.\n\nI next had a glass of Alsatian white wine, it reminded me of a riesling with a touch of wood (turpine, not oak), citrus notes, and a medium rounded body. It paired well with the first few courses. Next I had a glass of the Vin de Pays de Vaucluse \'Le Pigoulet en Provence\' H. Brunier; a Provencal red with nice complexity of fruit and tannins. Followed later by a glass of Italian red, Sangiovese; a solid all round red, the most common grape grown in the area. Finally at the end of the meal, we finished each with a shot of W.L. Weller Bourbon, that has a complexity on par with a good Scotch, at a lower price. I was hoping for a "rusty nail", but oddly they didn\'t have any Drambuie..\n\nFood\n\nHonestly, I can\'t remember every detail of the 8 course tasting, however I was thoroughly impressed. This was one of the best meals of my life! Keep in mind, I cook things like beef bourguignon, duck confit, and frog leg curry, as well as going to tastings regularly.\n\nOne dish my friend and I found a bit odd was the scallops with asian pear. The flavors paired well, but the texture contrast of creamy scallop with fibrous pear was a bit weird. One of the deserts was a celery ice cream, and it wasn\'t bad, just a bit odd. The top highlights to me where the variety of fish served, the pork 3 ways, and the sweetbread! I love sweetbread / thymus gland of a cow or big generally...\n\nAtmosphere\n\nThe open kitchen really impressed me. I tell my friends, the mark of a top-notch restaurant is when they let you peer into the kitchen, because then they can\'t hide anything. The patrons are upper-middle class, lots of "new money", and a bit of "old money". The staff is very polite, and will usher you through the restaurant by stepping out of your way. Noise levels is moderate, I didn\'t notice any background music playing. Definitely a great place to get a nice meal.\n\nOverall\n\nI was thoroughly impressed by my time here, as was my friend. You will pay for the experience, but there are few places in the city that can match this. Keep up the great work Jared!']
['I should have written this review a long time ago so I could give my fellow Yelpers the play-by-play of an excellent dining experience, but since it\'s been almost a year since I visited Craig on Main I\'ll give you this summary instead.\n\nOverall Thoughts: Craig on Main is one of my very very few FIVE STAR ratings.  This place serves up everything a five star restaurant should: superbly delicious food, beautiful plate presentation, perfectly trained wait staff, and an atmosphere that is elegant and inviting without being pretentious or overwhelming for the average Joe who also enjoys a $5 burger meal from In-N-Out on occasion. \n\nFood:  My date and I each ordered the chef\'s prix fixe meal.  Our server asked us if we had any food allergies or aversions and from there every item placed in front of us was a surprise.  A delicious surprise!  Not one serving disappointed.  \n\nService:  The service was probably the best I have ever had.  I have eaten at other "five star" restaurants where the wait staff was so attentive that I felt like they had joined the dinner table with me; not so at Craig on Main, there wait staff are like ninjas.  They just show up quietly and without intrusion when something is needed and then they quickly vanish without a sound.  \n\nPrice:  For a cocktail at the bar while waiting for you table, the prix fixe with wine pairing, tax, and gratuity expect to pay $125 per person.  If you love food and good service, then you will surely get what you pay for at Craig on Main. \n\nSide Note:  The day I ate here, I came down with a head cold and was not in the best of moods when we went for dinner.  None the less, the experience was great!  Next time I\'m in Boston I will be returning for sure.']
["Easily my favorite restaurant in Boston. \n\nWe've had both the tasting and the pre fixe dinner option. Looking back, the pre fixe dinner option was more satiating but both were exceptional. While I realize the menu changes per what's freshest that day, I highly recommend ordering the fried pig's tails for the pre fixe appetizer or the lamb with wild mushrooms and egg if it's on the menu. \n\nWe ordered the marrow side and the memory of it renders me speechless. Only sad thing was there was only two of us and I'm the only one who loves marrow. It broke my heart to not be able to eat it all--do make sure you have a a few helpers when tackling the marrow. \n\nReally, you can't go wrong here. I've never had a disappointing dish and every  aspect of the meal was perfect. You can tell there is great care and pride put into crafting the menu at Craigies. The service was great--super patient and helpful with explaining the menu and making recommendations for courses and drinks. \n\nAnd I'm always looking for another good excuse to go back soon :)"]
["When we heard that this restaurant served THE BEST hamburgers in the Boston area, my husband, being the burger connoisseur that he is, anxiously made a reservation. People, oh my heavens! The burgers were amazing. I don't even really eat meat all that often, especially not burgers, but this one was truly delicious. The house-made ketchup, the peanut oil-fried fries, the grass-fed beef ... all of it was excellent. Even the waiter's beautiful description of the food enhanced the overall experience. The service was friendly and attentive, the atmosphere was elegant, and the philosophy of the establishment was exactly my style. Oh, and I especially loved that the owner was in-house, acting as head chef. We loved this restaurant and will definitely be returning to experience the 'finer dining' side in the near future.\n\nOne more thing: I was especially pleased to find that the staff was more than willing to accomodate our toddler, taking the stroller upon our entering the resturant, providing a high chair without us having to ask, and offering to create a healthy whole-grain pasta &amp; vegetable dish since there wasn't anything on the menu that seemed suitable for a young child. It was easily one of the most pleasant experiences I've had taking my son out to eat."]
["We just did the 8 course tasting menu (for $10 more we went for all savory - this is not on the menu but they work with you) and it was a life changing dining experience. Just wow. The 8 courses turned into 10, compliments of Tony, who brought out one of the dishes himself. We also got a couple of complimentary drinks. The service was spectacular. 3.5 hours of dining heaven!\n\nCraigie should be on everyone's list for that special celebration of a birthday or an anniversary, or just of life and great food."]
['Very good Sunday brunch at Craigie, with friends who live nearby and have been a number of times before.\n\nBright, comfortable room with an impressive open kitchen and decently-spaced tables. Service was friendly, professional and polished.\n\nI had the corned beef cheek &amp; smoked beef tongue hash with poached egg and onion rings -- a moist, flavorful and savory dish, with a runny yoke to sop up with sturdy 7-grain toast. One companion had the ham, comte and cheddar panino with potato fries and fried egg, and the other had the chicken-fried country pork terrine with egg and black-eyed peas -- both of these were very good as well.\n\nWe did note a wide variation in portion sizes -- the hash was relatively modest with a single piece of toast, but the panino was a very ample affair, almost twice as much food on the plate.\n\nFor dessert we shared the almond bakewell tart with yogurt ice cream -- this was decent if not memorable.\n\nCoffee was under-roasted (with slightly sour overtones) and not strongly brewed -- this could have been better.\n\nOverall, though, a very fine brunch indeed. I look forward to returning for dinner some time.']
["Loved loved loved for brunch. Definitely need reservations. I had house made spaghetti with pork ragout, husband had grilled cheese with veal\n Both were amazing. Also j\nHad homemade donut which was good, but I'm a yeast donut kind of girl. A little pricey but food is worth it for sure. \nOne strange thing happened when we got there. We had 115pm reservations and showed up a few minutes early (1:11pm to be exact). The hostess told us she couldn't seat us until 1:15 which I thought was strange given there were several open tables. No big deal really, just odd."]
["Amber, do you go anywhere aside from Craigie when celebrating an occasion? No...not really. So here I was at Craigie again for a belated graduation celebration with one of my best friends who offered to take me here for dinner. I have great friends...who apparently love me enough to take me to my favorite restaurant ever! This particular evening ended up being a book signing/tour event so there were several ingredients and plates on the menu that are not usually there. The bartender also made a drink up for that evening that went with the prix fixe and it was pretty darn tasty.\n\nFor appetizers I got the ragout and the bone marrow. The ragout had veal sweet breads and cocks comb on it that evening. I've been dying to try cocks comb and while they were prepared fantastically, but they are not my thing I've discovered. But at least I get to cross it off of the list...As usual, the egg on top was cooked perfectly and the yolk flowed beautifully. I love a well cooked egg. The marrow was absolutely sublime as well and I never noted this before in any of my reviews, I think, but I love the fact that they cut the bone for you so it is easier to get all of the marrow. \n\nFor my main course I had venison 2 ways -- sausage and steak. This was a real treat as I rarely get to have venison in a restaurant and it was cooked to perfection -- medium rare, with a beautiful center. \n\nMy dessert was absolute heaven. I got the chocolate tart with salted butterscotch, a huckleberry sauce, and white chocolate-miso ice cream. I was super excited to try this because the ice cream alone sounded really interesting. It was a fantastic mix of salty and sweet and provided a great addition to the tart. \n\nAfter we left, I noticed there is a pumpkin soup on their menu that sounds great. Time to save up for another trip to Craigie! :)"]
['We returned to Craigie on Main for a birthday celebration and decided to go all the way with the Eight tasting with Pig Head option.  Fantastic dishes: Appetizer (bite each of Uni, Monk Fish Liver, and Sardine), scallop with refreshing sauce, slow roasted tasmanian fish, grilled cheese with mushroom and squash bisque,  braised mixture with egg on top, whole wheat pasta with ham, Pig head with pancakes, Vermouth gelatin, Cheesecake, Coconut espresso, Mexican Hot chocolate, and Almond cluster.  Drinks - Cabernet by the glass and Bourbon Manhattans. Over 3 hr to finish :)']
['I had been looking forward to trying Craigie On Main for over a year and my boyfriend made a reservation for our anniversary a little earlier this month.  I actually started a countdown the week we were going because I was so excited.  \n\nOur reservation was for 9PM and it was still bumping in there!  I liked looking into the kitchen and seeing everybody bustling around and preparing the plates.  To my dismay, we were led around the corner to a table right next to the kitchen door.  I was trying to not let it get me down, but it set the stage for the whole evening, and put a sour spin on what was supposed to be a special occasion.  There were no other tables available at that moment, so there we sat.\n\nService was mostly good and like others have mentioned, all of the waitstaff pitches in.  Our "main" waiter was an older gentleman and I felt uncomfortable asking him anything - it was almost like he was too busy to take much time with us unless we absolutely needed it and when I saw him laughing and joking with other tables around us, it made me wonder what the deal was.  This really bothered me.  It was a very awkward dynamic.  \n\nWe got the prix fixe menu and I started with the octopus, and my bf had the Maine clams.  Both were delicious and cooked to perfection.  The octopus took me back to my year spent working in Spain.  For our mains, bf chose the rib eye, and I had the pork three ways.  I wasn\'t crazy about my dish due to the suckling confit and the rib being a little dry, but I tried a few bites of the rib eye and it was everything you want a steak to be.  For dessert I got the sorbets and I loved the grapefruit, felt ambivalent about the mango, and was slightly repulsed by the yogurt flavored option.  The bf was very happy with his choice of the malted milk parfait.  \n\nAt the start of the meal I had wanted a glass of wine.  Not being familiar with the whites being offered by the glass, I asked our waiter for his recommendation.  He seemed confused by this and asked me what kind of wine I usually liked.  I said I wanted something slightly sweet and crisp.  Apparently this was not enough information, so I said that I generally enjoy most Rieslings.  I felt kind of stupid at this point.  He offered to bring a half bottle of Riesling.  I really only wanted a glass, but bf said he would partake in a glass of wine as well so we went along with it.\n\nI didn\'t notice until the next day, but I thought that the bill was a lot higher than I had expected.  I asked my bf to see the receipt and discovered that we were served a $60 half bottle of wine.  My bf told me not to worry about it, but I was upset.  Presumably if somebody asks for a glass of wine then they are not looking to spend that much on a half bottle, especially when there are full bottles of Riesling on the wine list that are within the same price range.  It\'s just another way that our waiter came off as careless about our visit.\n\nI was really hoping for a special night and this fell short.  The food was overall very good but I didn\'t feel welcome and don\'t think I will want to give it another shot in the future.']
['We went there for Easter brunch，it was a three-course meal with wonderful pastry and coffee. I had granola and yogurt for the first course, lamb leg and double eggs for main course and a chocolate flavor thing for dessert. Everything was so good, my friends and I really enjoyed it. Service was good too.']
["My personal heaven? A ten course tasting menu complete with cocktail, beer and wine pairings. On the evening of January 30, 2009, I'd thought I'd died and gone to straight to that big chef's kitchen up in the sky. It was my birthday and at precisely 7:30pm, our cab pulled up to Craigie on Main, our destination for the evening's celebration. From start to finish, the entire experience (nevermind the food) left me asking for nothing.  Every person we encountered graciously wished me a happy birthday, including chef Tony Maws, who delivered the last savory course himself, a trio of pork: prepared confit, with pig's feet and crispy pork belly.\n\nA meal of this proportion is not for the faint of heart or small of tummy. Though they are tastings, ten course is a lot. And give that each some comes with an expertly paired (thanks to Bar Manager/Mixologist Tom Schlesinger-Guidelli) wine, beer or cocktail, I was near-begging for mercy by the end of our meal. A course of ceviche seafood, oxtail, striped bass, turnip soup...I should be ashamed that I cannot remember them all. Pairings included sav blanc, a rare belgium beer, several cocktails, and several more wines.\n\nOur dessert courses included with two tea-infused panna cottas, profiteroles and some cardamom hot chocolate. Of course, we could not escape the evening without a nightcap of Fernet Branca on ice with just a hint of mint.\n\nA special occasion can be spent in no better way in my opinion, than with good food and wine (and cocktails and beer), and in good company. The attention paid to us throughout the evening was some of the best service I've experience in all of my dining experiences (from the card on the table wishing my a happy birthday from the chef) to each course being explained with attention to detail, and all my questions answered with ease. \n\nThough most of my experiences at Craigie are summed up by sampling a few cocktails at their very chill bar, tasting treats like house-made vermouth, I knew I couldn't review Craigie until I had eaten a proper meal here. Eaten I had. And proper it was.\n\nArrival Time: 7:30pm,\nDeparture Time: 11:30pm\nStatus: Happy Birthday, confirmed."]
['Just an update from our Boston friends.  The couple with whom we had our miserable experience went back to Craigie to give it a second chance.  They, and another couple,  said it was MUCH better.  The food was better and the service flawless.  They commented, "It was if we went to a completely different resturant.". I\'m glad for them, and Craigie,  but it just made our experience now seem even worse.']
["Lots o' good, a dash of snobbery. \n\nBoth cocktail and food (main dining and bar) menus are good. I had pork 2 ways as my entree, and it was absolutely 5 starts delish. Everyone seemed to enjoy their food and drink both times I dined there. \n\nCraigie loses one star (well, 1/2 for stupid name, so I guess half a star) for thinking it's God's gift to restaurants. Unaccommodating hostesses who seat my party in the bar area without warning=bad. Demanding a credit card for my small party on the weekend and my larger party during the week=bitch please! Once I've dined at your place and dropped several hundred dollars don't make me give you my credit card to hold my reservation like I'm some train-jumpin' hobo who may or may not show up. Get over yourself, you're a bistro, not heaven."]
['Ok...I am in the minority as I see glowing reviews\n\nThere is a ton to like about Craigie.  It is a nice space with an open kitchen in the front, a dining room to the left and the bar to the right.  The decor is very tasteful\n\nWe sat on the chefs table for my birthday.  The service is very officious as each waiter knows the food and wine.  The problem on that night was the food\n\nMy salmon was slow cooked so it had a different hue.  All of this was explained by the knowledgeable waiter.  Unfortunately, slow cooked can still be overcooked\n\nMy girls pork was also overcooked.....Now the hostess saw that she barely ate the food and she removed it from the bill.  We did not even ask.  \n\nI wanted to like this place, yet did not....However, I understand even the best have an off night and respect them for at least caring enough about customer experience to do the right thing\n\nAdded Star because the owner cared enough to call']
['Superb ingredients.  Excellent technique.  But in the end, and for the price point, nothing special.  Mostly all kind of bland.  Maybe they are going for subtle and delicate.  I dunno.  For $130+ per person with wine, completely  not at all worth it.\n\nI tried the squid noodle (best savory item I had, but as the amuse it was teeny), sashimi (boring but fresh) , pig tail (very nice), pork 3 ways (salty), the sausage stuffed chicken (bland), and the haddock (was ok).\n\nThe best thing I had all night  was the apricot-almond torte.\n\nAlso, THERE ARE TOO MANY PEOPLE WORKING THERE.  I have never seen anything like it.  There were never fewer than 5 of them crowding around our table chatting.  Sometimes 8 or 9.  It felt freaky and circusy.']
['after hearing so many good things about craigie on main i was excited to come here. the bff and i decided to try out their brunch first since its rated "One of the \'Hot 10\' Best Brunch Places in the USA" - Bon Appetit Magazine\n\nthe place wasnt packed. i made a reservation earlier this week and we were seated quickly upon arrival.\n\nwe both ordered freshly squeezed grapefruit juice.\n\nand we both ordered House-Smoked Scottish Salmon &amp; Albacore Tuna Rillettes with bagel and traditional accompaniments\nthis was pretty good. onion cream cheese + bagel + salmon and tuna ummmmmmmm. i also had two caperberries in my dish which i thought it was intelligent. ive never had it before, it looks like a olive and taste kinda like a olive but sour like a pickle and it has orange seeds inside. it def goes perfectly with fish giving a refreshing taste. the smoked salmon wasnt super salty like most smoked salmon.\n\n\nthe thing i also wanted to mention about this restaurant is that their service is fantastic. at the end of the meal i wanted to ask for check, so i turned around to look for our waiter. a guy (dressed in a blue shirt and didnt look like he\'s a waiter) saw me and approached me immediately and asked me if i needed for help. i thought that was pretty impressive. i wonder if he just stands there and observe if anyone needs help. i also had to go to the restroom and i asked a random waiter where the restroom was. instead of just pointing it to me which he totally could he actually walked me all the way to the restroom, it was very nice of him to do that.\n\nthe meal was pretty good and very well made but i dont think it wowed me. i def loved the friendly and professional service and the casual relaxed atmosphere. that\'s how every restaurant should be cuz i would not like a restaurant if they have bad service NO MATTER how good their food is!!!! even it\'s best food on earth or from heaven!!!!!']
['I was very excited to bring my girlfriend here for valentines day. It was a set menu and I knew it was going to be $150/person going into the dinner. So with this, we were expecting this meal to blow us away as it should at this price. The food was very good, but not amazing. And in my opinion when paying about $400 (with tax, tip, and a couple drinks) for a dinner for two, we should have had one of the greatest dinners of our lives. I believe that while the food was very good, it was almost a bit rude to price it this high. I would go back again, but would only want to pay 50-75% of what I paid.']
["What an amazing meal. Let me tell you --\n\nWe started with cocktails, the ardoise and something swizzle. The ardoise was beautiful, it's hard not to drink 100 of these. My swizzle drinks flavors unfolded as the ice melted... I'm pretty sure that's never happened before, but it was amazing. Highly suggested.\n\nThe atmosphere here is dimly lit, dark, romantic, with an eclectic flair. Bring a date. ;) We spoiled ourselves with a bottle of Barolo which was recommended by the waiter after I told him I was a fan of Italian wines, and wanted something big and jammy with no spice whatsoever. And he couldn't have suggested something more perfect! For the amuse bouche, I chose seafood, he chose meat. Mine was better, ha! I had squid noodles topped with crunchy garlic (so sad it was just a bite...). He had something with a bit of beef and beet, really pretty and delicate. First course, absolutely delicious. Especially the tuna which was layered with watermelon and pickled cucumber (? ...think cucumber salad cucumber). I chose oysters with a candied lemon mignonette that was just so dainty and fabulous. Second course, we both chose the beef...I was hesitant over the Salmon, but with this big Barolo, baby, I couldn't help myself. It was fantastic, dressed with greens, beets and carrots. Just lovely. And for dessert? Oh, just a little magic to finish off our palettes. I chose the goat cheese and pears which, if you love goat cheese as much as I do, you'll be in heaven. Pure bliss. They don't slack on the goat cheese either, just so ya know. He got a parfait, which was good, but really cold on my teeth. Haha, but hey -- I wouldn't have ordered it anyway. I was torn between the pears and the cheese spread. \n\nAll in all, it's pricey, but worth every penny."]
['Empty plate....burp !']
["I always rolled my eyes when hearing about the locavore movement, but Craigie on Main presents your tastebuds a compelling case. I personally don't care where any of my food comes from as long as it's not filled with mercury, lead, or other toxins, so I glazed over a bit when the waiter told us about tomatoes from farm x and beef from source y. The eggs were the freshest ones I've ever had, though!\n\nI try to go back whenever I can, and my goal next time is to try to pay attention to the waiter's presentation."]
['A certain generous lady recently got her tax return and decided it was time to break out of a frugal stretch in style.  I\'ve read up about Craigie and had been dying to try it for quite some time, so we decided on this night to dive in headfirst with the ten-course tasting menu.  Our server was very attentive and helpful throughout the meal, and it seems as if he spent quite a bit of time replacing the silverware for each course.  As most tasting menus are pretty much set in stone, I was surprised to be asked if there were any foods I didn\'t care for, or alternately, things I\'d like to see.  \n\nMany of the early courses were lighter seafood dishes, including a trio of squid noodles, sardine and tuna terrine topped with caviar.  Yellowtail sashimi was garnished with, among other things, some of the freshest salmon roe I\'ve ever tasted - the "pop" was miles ahead of most sushi bar salmon roe.  \n\nAround course five, a buckwheat pasta dish with uni and salty pork came out and represented a transition between the ligher seafood courses and the later meat-oriented dishes.  I wouldn\'t have felt right about it without more pork, and I was not disappointed with a beautifully prepared pork belly course. The meat and the preparation were top-notch, but some bites were a tad on the dry side... probably the only thing in the whole dinner that wasn\'t a slam-dunk.  A lamb course featured loin and lamb tongue, which I\'ll definitely be looking out for on future menus.  The lamb was brought out by Tony Maws himself - not sure if he does this for everyone, but even a brief visit from a chef as acclaimed (not to mention busy) as Tony was a really nice touch.\n\nSeveral dessert courses rounded out the evening, to which I added a glass of Blanton\'s bourbon.  I should mention the wine - the bottles aren\'t cheap and I was surprised, with the focus on local foods, to find that most of the wines were European.  Of course, I\'ve got no problem at all with that, and we enjoyed two pricey but thoroughly enjoyable bottles with the meal.  \n\nThe 349 reviews that came along before this one can attest to this as well - Craigie is big-league.  A destination for foodies from down the street and across the country.  While the total bill had a rather eye-popping figure at the bottom, at $110 a person the ten-course tasting menu might even be a deal.  Sadly it\'ll be awhile before either one of us can afford this again, but I\'ll be back for the pig\'s head and the marrow bones.']
['Very eclectic menu and great service. Did not get the tasting menu, but I would next time since our selections were very good. I am having trouble remembering what I ordered, but everything was delicious and creative.']
['Completely over rated joint in my opinion!\n\nWine, bread and coconut sorbet were very good....\n\nService was courteous and professional....\n\nBurgers and fried clams were a real real disappointment.... \n\nI will definitely try to digest the $215 spent on this meal.... Not worth it!']
["My wife and I had a fantastic evening at Craigie on Main.  Arrived at 7:45 for our 8:00 reservation. Our table was waiting for us. Service is absolutely top notch.  We were celebrating our 5th anniversary and it seemed the entire staff knew.  The atmosphere is perfect.  Not pretentious at all.  \n\nWe were welcomed with a drink compliments of the owner just as we sat down.  Our server was quite nice and recommended a fantastic, yet reasonably priced bottle of wine after inquiring as to what our types we typically like.  \n\nWe went with the prix fix option for $65 each.  Includes an amouse bouche starter, app, main and dessert.  \n\nMy amouse bouche was a duck breast with mushrooms and beets, my wife had squid noodles with something.  Small, but amazing.\n\nFor apps I ordered the pigs tail.  First time I've had pigs tail - like a bacon chicken wing.  Excellent.  I would have been more than satisfied if that was my main course.  My wife ordered the squash soup with pork belly grilled cheese.  Fantastic.  The chef sent over another grilled cheese for my wife when they saw she ate it so quickly.  First time I've experience something like that.  \n\nFor our main course we went with the roast chicken for two.  It came with a rice polenta.  A staffer brings out the chicken whole (cooked) then takes it away and carves it up.  They come back with two plates and all the hard work done.  By far the juiciest and most delicious chicken we have ever had.  \n\nFor dessert I had a chocolate mousse with white chocolate icecream and my wife had smoked pear with a scoop of icecream and cracker crumbs.  Both were great.\n\nBig surprise, another well deserved 5 star rating for Craigie on Main.  we cannot wait to go back.  \n\nForgot, after dessert a staffer brought over a couple cookies for us that looked like mini Pepperidge Farm Milanos along with another 'Happy Anniversary'."]
['I waited to write a review until I completed my own personal Triple Crown/Treble/Tricycle at this restaurant:  1) brunch, 2) dinner, and 3) the burger at the bar.  The summary of this review is CoM is a spectacular restaurant.  The passion for their food permeates through all of the staff.  I find its casual upscale vibe very appealing.  My basis is limited (mostly restaurants in Chicago and Boston) but this place is my gold standard for restaurant excellence.\n\nWhat\'s amazing is I\'ve dined here over a handful of times and I remember everything I\'ve eaten from the rotating seasonal menu except for maybe the desserts (I\'m not much of a dessert guy).  Notable standouts include olive oil poached halibut over beets (the best fish dish I\'ve ever had), pork three ways, and grilled octopus with citrus flavors (an appetizer).  I also recommend getting the bone marrow as a side to share.  \n\nThe first time I dined here was for brunch with my now fiancé.  We started playing a game to see if our glasses of water would ever go beyond half empty (it was a warm summer day).  They never did.  Needless to say we left well hydrated and were impressed by the attentive service.  For brunch, I usually look for something with a poached egg and the donut and the hot chocolate (containing flavors I\'ve never experience before) are worthy additions.  \n\nMy most recent visit here was to try the heralded burger.  My fiancé and I arrived 30 min early on a Saturday to make sure we would be seated at the bar.  We ended up being the first ones served the burger that night.  I ordered the burger medium rare with bacon.  In short, the burger is perfect and I wouldn\'t change a thing.  It is beyond me how it is so juicy.  The flavor of the bone marrow that is added to the patty really comes through.  I really like their house made ketchup (conventional ketchup I find too sweet) and the potato wedges are a great compliment to the burger.\n\nMy final note is half the times I\'ve dined here, I\'ve been served by the older gentleman.  I have to admit, I initially thought he was a little brusque.  I also tend to mispronounce the French terms on the menu which elicited a look from him as if he\'s saying "are you sure you can handle the level of food you will be eating?"  But like any good server, he is attentive and politely answers any questions.  He ends up being the perfect server for enjoying this restaurant.\n\nIn short, a terrific restaurant and one that I look forward to each time I visit.']
['This place is really good. From an expensive night out ordering the tasting menu or getting a burger at the bar, so consistent.']
['Had a delicious meal, and was VERY impressed by how KIND everyone working there was.  \n\nWent with two friends; we shared the $10 bone marrow special as a "starter"--greasy, fatty, salty goodness!  And a bargain price for a very generous portion (three bone shanks, so each of us got one good serving).  My friends had the burgers and also really enjoyed them.  We ended with dessert--goat\'s milk sorbet that was a nice mix of sweet and almost tart (goat\'s milk) and a DELICIOUS mascarpone with almond crust.  In many ways, a lick-the-bowl-clean good meal.\n\nI also recommend the signature cocktails.  Between us we tried three or four of them, and each of us enjoyed our drinks.  \n\nWe ate at the bar, and Anne, our bartender/server, was wonderful.  She was kind and patient when I arrived worried about getting in the burger orders on time, provided excellent advice re drinks, and let us enjoy a break between dinner and dessert without pressure to either order more or get out of the way--on a Friday.   The other bartenders and servers were also great.  I\'d never had bone marrow before and the woman who brought the plate over very nicely explained how to eat it.  In addition, as I observed the waiters, hostess, owner (?) during the evening, I noticed they were always polite, nice, and observant of what people needed, giving the whole restaurant a comfortable, relaxed atmosphere.']
["My husband suggested coming here last week for two reasons: 1. He heard that the Craigie burger was the best in town and 2. I was feeling under the weather and he's convinced that fatty burgers cure sickness (Is this what they teach in med school?) We arrived at 5:30. I thought that my husband was being consider and planned this so I could go to bed earlier, but now that I've read through some reviews, I've learned that it must have been because there are a limited number of burgers served a day. The actual number of burgers Craigie limits itself to seems to be somewhat of a mystery since various reviewers are throwing out different numbers (18, 20, 25?). The point is, it's limited and in high demand.\n\nThe burger came out and I immediately knew I would have trouble holding it. It wasn't wide, but it was pretty tall. When I tried holding up the burger, the patty started sliding out of the buns because the juice from the patty made it slippery. Then, the bun started falling apart because it was soaked in juices too. When I was finally able to bite in, the meat looked on the rare side even though we asked for medium rare. There was a puddle of oil and blood forming on my plate so I had to place a piece of bread on top of it to soak it all up so I wouldn't have to look at it. I, along with my plate, was a total mess. It was one of those tricky situations where I couldn't place my burger down because I would cause a bigger mess, but then I really wanted to put the burger down so I could grab a napkin so I could wipe my grease-covered hands on something.\n\nTo sum it up, the burger itself was good, but a little too fatty for me. I've had better at a couple of places in SF and even within Boston, I think the burger at Radius (now closed) was a better fit for me. The potatoes wedges were great and the red vinegar pickles were amazing. Wish I could buy a jar of the pickles alone."]
['1st stop on my best burger in Boston tour\n\nMy girlfriend and I tried this place out after hearing about "The Burger". I\'d seen write up on MSN, and had multiple friends tell me about it, and we finally got to try it. \n\nLet me start with the fact that the burger blew away my expectations, and this was after I\'d been told it was the "best burger you\'ll ever have." \n\nWe arrived at the restaurante just before 5:30 on Sunday, which is when the open, and there was a line of people waiting at the door. We sat at the bar, and the bartender, Anna, was extremely nice, knowledgable and quick. We ask her multiple questions about the drink and food menus, and she responded with no hesitation. \n\nThe food was great. From the bread that came out, to the burger (a perfectly medium rare), the cheese , the bacon on the burger (probably the best slice of bacon I have ever had) the french fries (crispy on the outside, perfectly seasoned and cooked)\n\nMaybe I should have waited to go to this place, since it\'s not really fair to compare other burgers to this one...']

["One of my favorite restaurants in Cambridge. The chef's whim is a great deal, and the bar is wonderful. The octopus appetizer and the hamburger are among my favorite dishes."]
["OK, everyone is just saying that it is a great place. So I decided to give it a try. I wanted to spend a special evening and didn't want to make a mistake. Well, the place was crowded and noisy. The waiter super kind but exaggeratedly acting. The style of the place pretentious but neither classy nor cozy.\nThe dishes were nothing special (more an them below) and everything was extraexpensive (for what they offered). Just to give you an idea, we had only two courses, a shared dessert and two glasses of wine. Total=140$. Well ... at least the dishes ought to have been special. They weren't. My partner had a cod and she send it back. I had a Vermont pork. It consisted in three small pieces of pork meat. One of them was just a little ribs with no meat at all on it. \nDefinitely, I will not return. If I spend that kind of money, I like to have to spend a nice evening, eat nice food (in reasonable quantity), not being compelled to fight against the noise and the like. \nBottom line: pretentious, expensive, overestimated."]
["After a long afternoon spent in the rain, we settled at the bar about twenty minutes before our reservation.  The adventurers that we are, we couldn't decide between the half pig's head and the tasting menu.  Our server told us that both could be accomplished and that it would be filling, but not overfilling.  My stomach would beg to differ.\nThe courses before the pigs head were small enough that the pigs head seemed reasonable, but perhaps the suggestion of three half bottles is what made our experience a little too indulgent.  \nIn hindsight, I don't regret the experience.  The stars of the night were the expertly created craft cocktails (they actually carry Arak!) and the pig's head. We had pork in many forms, but this is probably my favorite!\nIf we were to return, I'd most likely order off the menu.  Everything is seasonal, and the pasta and veg were fresh.  Try Craigie for a casual or nice night out."]
['Like others, I really wanted to like Craigie.  We went once before, sat at the bar, had a fabulous burger and delicious wine &amp; it was a blast.  This time I made a reservation as typically you can\'t just walk in and get a spot at the bar.  I was told it was for one of the high tops in the bar area, which was fine with me.  \n\nWe got there and were told to wait near the bar (their waiting area) and someone would get us a drink.  Like other reviewers, we were ignored for the drink order (but given plenty of water??)  and actually never ended up ordering anything because by the time they came to us, we had drank enough water to fill us up.  We decided to wait for our seat.\n\nWe ended up getting seated in the main dining room.  I really like the bar area, so I was slightly disappointed.  I then realized that the burger was not on the menu.  So when the super sweet waitress came back to ask us what we we were thinking of for dinner, I told her I was really looking forward to the burger that I keep seeing go by.  She seemed put off, and blankly said that the burger is ONLY available in the bar.  \n\nThat was it. No offer to get me one anyway.  Just no.\n\nIf you\'re a foodie, you\'ll enjoy this place.  I like good food, but am by no means a foodie.  This menu is too eclectic for me.  But I figured I\'m about to dish out some REALLY good money for this meal, so I\'m going to try EVERYTHING that comes to me.\n\nI got a vegetable salad, which seemed like it should have been warm, but it wasn\'t.  I tried each vegetable, and actually thought I made a respectable showing, but apparently I did not.  The woman who cleared my plate asked if I wanted to take it home.  I very nicely &amp; sweetly said No I\'m all set (because I know it is good food, and just because I don\'t like it, I didn\'t want anyone to think it was bad. It just wasn\'t my taste)\n\nThen right before our main dish came, a different woman came by and asked if I wanted something else, because she realized I didn\'t like my salad.  Shocked, I said oh no thank you, I\'m all set.  She left and my husband said to me "did you say something??" - to which I answered no.  I purposely did NOT say anything because I didn\'t want to make a scene.  \n\nI had the swordfish, which was much less cooked than I like, and small pieces for the price.  \n\nIn the end I really just wanted their burger.  Lesson learned.  I should have told them that my reservation was for a table in the bar, so I could have GOTTEN the burger I wanted, and not spent $350 on food I really wasn\'t into.\n\nyes. $350.  So maybe our wine was pricey (and the best part of the meal), but still.  that is a lot of $$ for a meal.  You\'d think they\'d make an exception for a patron who asked for something they actually sell on the menu.']
["I hated every last minute of my meal here. Just kidding. It's as good as everyone says it is. Highly recommend trying the tasting menu at least once. It's quite the culinary experience. \n\nDidn't enjoy hearing Maw throw a fit in the kitchen, but the guy is fantastic at what he does and I can't blame him for being a perfectionist. \n\nLong story short: eat here."]
['Definitely better than our last experience when we had the six course tasting menu. This time we decided to go the a la carte route.\n\nThe fried pig tails alone are worth coming back for! We loved them so much we ordered another serving to go. So succulent, slightly crispy and savory. Nice touch of cilantro to brighten it up. NOTE: the take home order was much fattier with less meat...maybe it was ordered late into the night that they ran out of the good stuff?! \n\nThe whole chicken was definitely above average. Moist chicken with slightly crispy skin...could have been crispier. But the taste was good. \n\nThe bone marrow was nice. Could have used a touch more salt. The duck fat brussel sprouts were pretty good. \n\nThe octopus was nice and soft but the sauce was a touch too salty. \n\nAll this with a very good bottle of wine recommended by our super helpful and knowledgable server...Domaine du Gros Nore 1999 Bandol']
["We showed up to Craigie on Main for the Sunday brunch with dreams of a perfect hamburger. We were not disappointed.\n\nThe atmosphere of Craigie during brunch is pretty relaxed, aided by the ample spacing between tables and the midday sunlight filtering through the wooden blinds. We were twenty minutes early for our reservation but were seated immediately.\n\nOur inaugural time at Craigie, the hamburger, corned beef and hash and a doughnut were ordered. I saw videos of the hamburger being prepared, and I was worried that the hype was greater than the meal would be. This was happily not so: the burger was wonderfully rich, flavorful and pink on the inside. Delicious. The fries were perfectly crispy, and the condiments (especially the pickles) were great.  The corned beef and hash was also a wonderful dish, perfect for brunch. \n\nWe finished up with the doughnut which was a cake-style type with a caramel sauce. It wasn't too sweet, was crispy on the outside and not dry on the inside. I think I've never had such a good cake doughnut. Its actually fortunate that there was only one, because it might not be the kind of pasty where two could be consumed. \n\nThe brunch was a great meal, and we will definitely be returning to try other menu items!"]
['I feel like such a hater giving only 4 stars, but after my second visit, I cannot say I have found perfection here yet. The first time here, I got the "big" tasting, and it was overwhelming to say the least. After half the meal, I could barely taste the remaining, because I was so focused on just getting things in my stomach. I cannot even remember anything I ate...\n\nMore recently, I returned for burgers. They are good. Really, really, really yummy - 5 stars all the way. But, I could care less for the thick starchy fries. And the salad had too much frisee to my dismay (I HATE frisee). The dressing was pretty good. What else did I have? Oh yes, pig tails. Mmmmm. It\'s all about the sauce though. There\'s no reason to use pig tails, instead of any other type of meat. And we got a side of brussels sprouts roasted in duck fat. I LOVE brussels sprouts, and I also prefer my veges soft rather than crunchy, but these were way too soggy. I also could not distinguish anything different about roasting in duck fat. I was too full for dessert, but instead received a free little hot chocolate. That was pretty divine - superbly balanced between sweet and bitter and spicy. \n\nCraigie is a very very fine restaurant indeed. Definitely worth a visit, and maybe some repeats, but not something I spend my days at work dreaming about.']
["Maybe my expectation was too high.  I found the food here is good but not impressive.  It is more for people who are more adventurous with what they eat.  They have a great wine list though (a lot of French wine).\n\nYou will need to make a reservation if you want to eat there on Friday or Saturday.  You can sit at the bar too (and you can order burger there).  They don't offer burger on a regular menu."]
['Extraordinary and certainly 5 stars. The 6-course tasting meal was unique, exotic, and so delicious.  The chef accommodated a no-pork request in our dining party and provided inventive, delicious seafood replacements. At the end of the 6-course meal, we were happily full but not uncomfortably stuffed.  Only criticism is the price of wine bottles. Sure, restaurants have markups on wine bottles but some were just way too high.']
['On a recent visit I ordered the tasting menu for the first time.  The menu featured mostly fish and left me wishing I ordered a la carte.  The stuff on the a la carte just taste better.\n\nAt no fault of its own, the atmosphere at Craigie On Main has changed from a local Central Sq treasure to the type of place that business men go to and take clients out.  Long gone are the days of a casual local Craigie; except the ingredients are still local!  I guess this is what happens with James Beards and other accolades.  The food is still superior.']
['Imagine my excitement when I discovered that Craigie on Main made birthday cakes to order! I quote:\n\n"Pastry Chef Jessica Scott has come up with yet another winner: Cakes for your special occasions - birthdays, anniversaries, and others. With 48 hours notice, she can create a cake for your table in flavors ranging from peanut butter, to burnt caramel, to chocolate infused with espresso, to a traditional carrot cake and beyond. Or, if you just can\'t decide or are feeling adventurous, have Jess choose for you! Our Pastry Chef\'s Whim is guaranteed to delight. Just give us a call at the restaurant if you\'d like to order a cake for your special occasion."\n\nThen imagine my extreme disappointment when I called a week in advance requesting for one and was denied because the restaurant does not entertain pick up orders but only for dine-in customers only--This was not entirely clear on their website at all. Seriously, I don\'t think all 30 of my guests can afford to dine here just to have a slice of cake (even if they wanted to).\n\nI was just surprised that the restaurant was willing to forgo my business when I all wanted was to do a pickup for the half sheet ($95). I wish I had known this earlier so that I could make other arrangements because this glitch totally messed up my party plans as I had to scramble for another bakery to take my last-minute order. \n\nI\'m a fan of your food, CoM, but this is not cool at all.']
['Absolutely Appealing and Almost Affordable\n\nAll of their flavors are strong yet sane,\nAssorted menu, seldom mundane, \nAs you dine, sip some champagne,\nAnd service is a beauty and brain (neither a pain nor plain!)\nAn open kitchen to witness your meat slain,\nAlbeit, worry not, it is all humane, \nArtery it clogs though and the vein,\nAfter many courses it will you detain,\nAppetizers over main courses reign,\nAlthough the price makes your head spin in vain, \nA-minus grade goes to Craigie on Main.']
["This place ...transcends.  It's the first time I've ever eaten somewhere where I felt that I lacked a sophisticated enough palette to enjoy the food offerings properly.  For my money it's the top food experience in Boston I've had.  The staff here is..mm..elegant.  Even the people bussing our table knew everything about what we were eating, where it was grown, what to suggest for drinks - offered very informed suggestions when they thought we may enjoy another wine more - the whole deal.  \n\nFrom what I understand, the menu changes daily as everything is chosen fresh that morning.  The night I visited last week, one of the specials was a pigs head meant to be shared - my friends and  are rather adventurous so we went for it, and while a bit daunting it ranks as the most amazing culinary experience I've ever had.  If you're there - definitely order a pigs head.  I've never tasted anything quite so savory and delicious.  There are few dining experiences I can point to and say I will remember that night for the rest of my life, and that was definitely one of them.  :)"]
["What?! Still trying to figure out why this place is so well-known for its food!\nProbable the worse Monkfish dish I've ever tried ever!\nJust a huge waste of my money and time.\nOnly thing good here was the wine list. \nIt would be a 1 star if it wasn't for the wine list."]
['In my humble opinion, this is the best Restaurant in the Boston area. Atmosphere is upscale casual, services is on point, bartenders/drinks are excellent, and the food is the best. \n\nI have been here 4 times, 2 at the bar and 2 at tables. I had the burger at the bar and it was the best burger I have ever had. The bartenders are super friendly, and willing to share their endless booze knowledge. \n\nSitting g at the tables, the services was great and all of the dishes were inventive and delicious. \n\nthe fried pig tails are a must try. \n\nexpensive but completely worth it.']
['My travel plans were spoiled one Friday night, so alone in Boston for the weekend, I treated myself to dinner at Craigie - something I had wanted to do since I moved to the city.\n\nSomething about dining in such decadence alone made me feel uncomfortable, but the hostess was friendly, seated me at the bar, and my fears were assuaged. I had gone in for a burger, but upon seeing the open kitchen and the bartenders enjoying mixing cocktails (and other solo patrons at the bar), I decided I was in for the long haul. I ordered the seven course tasting menu.\n\nThree cocktails, eight PERFECTLY executed courses and one encounter with Tony Maws later, I hopped in a cab - blissful about my poor circumstance.\n\nWith a date or without, this is a must-must-must do.']
["My husband and I went for dinner the other night.  And I have to say that everything was excellent - the food, the atmosphere and the service.  So, why I don't give it five stars?  Honestly, if I could give it four and a half, I would but I couldn't bring myself to give it five for a couple of reasons.\n\nFirst, you really have to know what you are getting into.  The food, although excellent, is overly stuffy. The ethos of the restaurant really is that the chef knows best. Obviously, the chefs are very good but it was tough for my husband and I to find something that we could eat with enthusiasm.  Be prepared to be adventurous and to not be overly controlling of your meal. (Think half of a hog head landing on a table next to you - in full form. That actually made me give up me (excellent) tea and leave. It might make me a wimp but I just really couldn't stare at it.)  My husband's meal was cooked to perfection. Mine (the sirloin) had some really tough parts to it.  I do have to say that I normally don't like clams but their clam appetizer was really good.\n\nSecond, the service is really attentive.  However, it is not exceptional.  To me, exceptional service is when you don't even feel the waiter's presence. Things happen and are moved along precisely when they need to.  My husband and I felt that we were being asked how things were every 5 minutes. Attentive - but intrusive as well. I often felt interrupted, rather than helped.  However, the waiters communicate all your needs with each other.  When a new waiter came with our dessert menus, they already knew what we could and couldn't eat due to religious restrictions. It was a nice touch.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth a try. But, will I being going back whenever I can? I don't know - I think I prefer a homier, simpler aesthetic to my food.  But, if you want good food creatively prepared and are ready to be adventurous, this is a really good option for you."]
["I'd been told I had to go to Craigie on Main for their tasting menu, and I will be back for it but my first visit was for a Sunday brunch. You must get the doughnut. Best $5 doughnut ever. The coffee is fantastic. The side of house smoked pork belly was salty and meaty and perfectly crisped. I had the House-Smoked Ham, Comte and Shelburne Farm Cheddar Panino which was the perfect combo of cheesy, greasy, melty and sour with the garden pickle thousand island dressing.\n\nMy boyfriend got the famous burger which was decided to be famous for very good reason. The spicy bloody mary was quite tasty and spicy but a bit full of chunky things once you got to the bottom, not the best part. The service was very attentive although we did see various bussers more often than our specific server but it all worked out.\n\nI'd been a tad nervous about a dress code because the place is so high-end on cost but we turned up there in jeans and sneakers and no one blinked an eye. It was a fun and delicious time for sure and we'll be back (once we've saved a bit more money) for the tasting menu (for which I'm told it's best to pull up to the bar and chat with the chefs)."]
['Amazing food, that takes full advantage of the farm to table movement.  The octopus and pork 3 ways was pitch perfect.  Service was amaze-balls: the wait staff was spot on with their numerous recommendations.  One downside: chef was in Uber Gordon Ramsey mode and we saw several loud and rude exchanges between line chefs and the master. Off-putting and clearly within ear range of upper dining room.']
["My labmate James and I went on a whim on the snow day here in Boston.  The scene was busy, but still very intimate.  We arrived around 6 and were the first table seated, and didn't feel rushed at all even though we enjoyed our meal over 3 hours.\n\nWe decided to have a pig fiesta.  Appetizers: pig's tail and rye fusilli with pig confit ragout, entree: the pig's head for two and desserts: valrhona chocolate cremaux and the creme caramel.  Drinks: Northern Lights, Orchard Mule, Plainfield Swing and the Martinez.  The pig's tail and the pig's head were amazing:  confit done perfectly, crispy skin, succulent flesh, and yes, fatty, but overall very enjoyable.  I agree with the other reviews that an acid would have helped cut the richness of the pig's head, but  even without it was a great dish.  In our ignorance, we expected the pig's tails to be the cartoon-style curlicues but instead it was more like oxtail - fatty tender meat on the bone.  The drinks were also fantastic, intriguing flavor combinations that didn't overwhelm any of the food.\n\nThe desserts left a bit to be desired - great textures, but the anise of the Chartreuse in the chocolate was a bit overwhelming and the creme caramel was tasty but not something to write home about.\n\nThe service was a definite highlight:  our server was very charming and knowledgeable, and steered me away from drink selections that wouldn't pair well with the food being served."]
['If Cragie isn\'t the best restaurant in Cambridge, it\'s surely right there at the top of the list. There are two distinct areas in the restaurant, the main dining room, and the bar area. Both are amazing, and will be covered in the review. The main difference is that the bar tends to be a bit louder, but it\'s a nice and lively environment. \n\nFood: Chef Maws and the entire kitchen crew do an amazing job taking local (and high quality, seasonal, organic) products and giving them a new American twist. They also show their "nose to tail" philosophy by serving both pigs tails (in a spicy nuoc cham sauce) and a 1/2 pigs head for 2 people. The burger is one (if not the) best in Boston. Sides of bone marrow appear as massive bones split length-wise with plenty of Iggy\'s bread. Having eaten at the bar several times, as well as a la carte and tasting menu in the dining room, I\'ve never been disappointment by anything.\n\nDrinks: Let\'s start with beer, being the most straightforward. The selection is small, but very well selected, and rotates frequently. You will probably find some local brews, along with some European brethren. Wine, the wine list is very well selected, and has many odd/funky bottles from areas that are lesser known (try the Philippe Bornard "Tant Mieux" with the pig head). Now lets get to the cocktails, Craigie is a restaurant that I would go purely for the drinks. Get a seat at a bar, and chat up one of the bartenders. Much like the food, I\'ve never been disappointed by any drinks. If I\'m at the bar, I\'ll usually ask for drinks that pair with whatever I\'ve ordered. \n\nAtmosphere: The bar is busy, but never overly so. It gets lively, and with enough people enjoying themselves it can get a little noisy. The dining room is calmer, and a little more upscale without being stuffy. Everyone is very friendly and accommodating, service is very professional with still being friendly. It is also fun to peer inside the open kitchen. \n\nFinal Thought: A must try! Go to the bar with a friend and get a burger and drinks. If you are looking for a special occasion dinner, Craigie should be at the top of your list!']
["Did a 6 course chef's whim for restaurant week.  Very impressed with the cocktails and desserts.  Service was impeccable and the kitchen is frenetic, completely controlled, and very fun to watch.  Squid noodles &amp; fish sauce 5 stars, yellow tail sashimi 4 stars (delicious), Grouper &amp; beets 3 stars, Duck Egg 3 stars (lentils were delicious, dish overal sorely needed acid though),  Chicken 4 stars (awesome), 5 different desserts each of which were spectacular.\n\nSeveral dishes lacked acid in some components that screamed for it.\n\nOverall I had a great time, given the price and the small missteps I might suggest cocktails and dessert at the bar rather than a tasting menu though."]
["This is an updated review. I have not gone to this restaurant in 4 years. My friends and I are going to Boston Mag's top 50 restaurants each month and of course, Craigie on Main was on the list. I went with one companion and we chose off the prix fix menu. I had the octopus appetizer, the sea trout with a hazelnut sauce and the chocolate decadence cake with ice cream. My companion had the beef entree with the beet salad with the fruit sorbets for dessert. The food was divine and the portions were perfect. I left there full but not overstuffed. The octopus was a very big portion compared to other restaurants I have had it yet and was delicious. The trout was slow cooked so it was very lightly cooked (kind of like tuna). The flavor was mild, texture lovely and the hazelnuts gave a nice crunchy contrast.   The decadence cake was really good and it had a chocolate crunchy crumbs sprinkled over it. If you grew up loving the chocolate crumbs in a Carvel cake- this was the big girl's version. Great service and I look forward to having dinner here again."]
["We've been going to Tony Maws' restaurant since it was the Craigie Street Bistro. \nIf there's better, I literally can't imagine it. \nEvery time, we surrender to the Chef's wonderful manifestations of culinary creativity and precise execution. The wine pairings deserve separate praise, and speak to the thought put into your experience. \nSure, it's expensive, but for the special occasions when we dine there, they have always hit it out of the park. Absolutely worth it."]
["The only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars was that we had to wait 45 minuets for our table, and we already had late reservations. We called several days in advance and the earliest table we could get was 9:00. As we waited for our table we ordered a drink, but never got it. Apparently there was a mistake at the bar. Once we were seated and they realized what had happened, the bar tender personally came over to apologize, and brought us a complimentary cocktail that he had just prepared with fresh peach puree. \n\nThe rest of the evening went smoothly the wait staff was wonderful, they all seemed to work together. One waiter, who wasn't ours, over heard my friend say that she needed a new napkin and came right over with a replacement without us even asking. \n\nWe both ordered the 6 course tasting menu. I can't remember everything I ate because it was a little while ago, but it was amazing! The Amuse Bouche was so tasty and probably not something I would have ordered myself. The softshell crab tempura was perfect. The balance of flavor and texture were right on. I have never had tempura so perfectly crispy like that before, not even in good Japanese restaurants! \n\nIt's quite pricy, however, reviewing the ingredients in each of the dishes I had no issues with the prices. The food was exceptional and I left feeling overly stuffed! because we were seated to late we ended up missing the last T and had to take a cab home, so I would recommend trying to get earlier reservations if you are going to have the 6 or more course tasting menus, because it's an experience that can take time. I won't say exactly, but our bill had some adjustments to it for the trouble we had had earlier, which we weren't expecting and appreciated!"]
["This is a hard restaurant to review.  (Though just to put it out there first, the service is fantastic. They treated us wonderfully. This is a review of the food and the environment.)\n\nThere are about three different ways I can think to review Craigie.  \n\n1. Is it worth 350 dollars for a dinner for two?    -- Maybe\n2. Is it the best restaurant to spend 350 dollars for dinner for two?  -- Probably not, I think there are better ones. But its worth it for novelties sake.\n3. How does it compare to other restaurants I've been to:   It's one of the best in Boston but have no desire to go back.\n\nCompared to the average Boston restaurant, Craigie on Main is much better, much different. But the whole appeal which you are paying for is for it to be better and different than your average Boston restaurant. So its a low bar, which they and about 30 other restaurants easily clear.\n\nThe other thing that makes it hard is that the experience of Craigie is very different depending on where you sit. We asked to be sat at the bar that looks into the open kitchen to see all the meals being prepared.  Which I would recommend, though would caution that if you are someone that gets anxious for other people, your entire dinner is side-lined by the fact that you are hoping that that one cook that dropped the four nearly done haddock doesn't get fired  because as instant replay would have totally shown that the oven has pretty serious design flaws or that the fresh out of culinary school chef that prepares the little appetizers will get more confidence and guidance throughout the show.  Because basically if you are sitting at the table you are enjoying a show, The food you eat isn't really enough to tear you away from it.   If you don't sit at the open table, you are probably just going to hear dropped pans and people screaming, but miss all the aggressive comments muttered under breath, all the panic. \n\nWe did the tasting menu, the 8 courser.  Which with the number of small addons they give you is actually an 11 courser. And its a gut puncher. You are going to need to walk home.  For me, the dessert, a three course service disguised as the final course became anxiety-provoking. How rude is it to just say I am sure so much care went into this intricately prepared chocolate roll but if I eat it I might throw up? \n\nThe main damning critique for the restaurant, is that none of the meals were especially memorable. When counting up/down the courses we couldn't  really remember them all. There were only two that really stuck with us, the polenta and fried egg, and the plum soup soda, as these were the gustatorially surprising and fun, interrupting what felt more like a conveyor belt of high quality but not especially interesting courses."]
["Tried their burgers. Really nice. Dinner last weekend with friends in US. Last 2 in the house at just 7pm. Luck they reserved 2 for us so we shared. Didn't make reservation and wanted to sit at the bar but full just 15mins after they opened for dinner, 5:45pm. Good that we decided to stay. Ordered the rib eye to share. Nice. Ordered the pig tails for appetizer. Really good. Nicely cooked. I am a Chinese so I know how a good cooked pig tail taste like and it was so good."]
["I had Chef's whim dinner at Craigie on the Main with a bunch of friends Sunday.\nService was very good.  There were a variety of bread that taste pretty good, but can be better if they warm them up.\nThe food was ok for me.  A couple of dishes are spectacular, rest does not fit with my taste well.  I really liked the fresh egg/crab meat dish and the fried smelt with squid ink and   I am ok with the sashmi dish (not any better than a sushi restaurant) and mussel.  I am not a big fan of pork two ways (too fatty for me), asparagus ice cream (some things are better as vegetable), and coffee ice cream (sometimes normal ice cream is good enough).\nOverall, I am not wowed by the food, and given the price, probably won't go back."]
["Five start service. Great setting. Lovely menu. Just as simple as a star off for the food (it was very good, not at all great) and a star off for the price (the food is not worth the price). $74 for a half a pigs head? Oh, vegetables are extra. I'm used to a glass of wine costing as much as a bottle.\n\nYou know, the prices would be fine, if the food was AMAZING, it isn't. It is very good."]
["My sister, friend and I went here last night. All our first time. We all started with a cocktail. I had a twist on a Manhattan which was quite good.\n\n Small bites came out first, my was some sort duck with a tart veggie base under it. Absolutely divine. 1st course came next, I had the sashimi salad with watermelon. This was bright, fresh and delicious. My sister had the grilled octopus and my friend the winter point oysters. They enjoyed them a lot.\n\n Next we picked out a really good bottle of Sancerre 'L'Autentique' which was a really amazing sauvignon blanc. After the wine came out our server (who was helpful and knowledgeable) suggested a few sides that weren't on the menu. We went with the bone marrow that came with a nice toast and sea salt. I have to say this was my first time and it was one of the more savory delicious things I've had in some time!\n\nMain Course was the pork belly wrapped swordfish. I'm normally hesitant getting fish in most restaurants but this was cooked just right. \nClosed out the dinner with a raspberry chocolate dessert that was quite good. \n\nExpect to spend a hundred plus for the full experience but it comes with a smartly done dinner with exceptional service.\n\nNote: After ordering the marrow and enjoying with no tact or discretion (I joked of gnawing at the bone itself), three of the surrounding tables ordered it in turn!\n\nWell worth a visit."]
["Excellent service, amazing burger!\n\nWe went to the Craigie On Main while we didn't have a reservation for the bar section (They only serve their famous burgers in the bar section!). We didn't want to sit in the main seating area because it was later in the evening, we had our young child with us and we didn't want to stay there for hours, and go for a multiple course dinner. \n\nAlthough they were full in the bar section, they set a new table for us and accommodated us very nicely with two chairs and a high chair. We truly enjoyed our dinner. We paid $60 for two burger dishes (Burgers come with side salads and awesome hand-cut fries) and two soft drinks including tax and 25% tip (we loved the service!). Reasonable price for such food and service!"]
["Only one word can properly describe Craigie: HEAVEN.  It's that good.  \n\nThis was, simply put, the best dining experience of my life.  The waitstaff was excellent - very attentive while also managing not to disrupt your conversation or overall experience.  They also managed to be very funny and upbeat. \n\nThe food was amazingly delicious.  What was my favorite of the tasting menu? The venison was sublime and left me speechless.  The apple cider foam was addicting (excuse me, can I get mass amounts of this delivered to my apartment on a daily basis?) and the fish courses were exceptional.  \n\nThe drinks (and bartenders) are also amazing.  You can get an excellent craft cocktail here or choose a wine from an varied selection.  The waiters are helpful and spot on with giving recommendations.\n\nThis place is definitely deserving of all the praise it gets (and maybe even some additional praise) - it's a wonderful experience.  I can't wait to go back!  This is truly how fine (yet casual) dining should be."]
['You know how women like a man with confidence?  Not cocky, just strong and confident?  That\'s sort of the way I felt Craigie on Main was treating us as restaurant-goers.  They led me and my girlfriend in and said "Just get comfortable, and let us take care of you."  Honestly, if the restaurant had a voice it would sound like Barry White.\n\nThe treatment began when we first walked in about 10 minutes early.  They took our coats and led us to an open spot on the ramp down to the bar.  They gave us a drink menu and poured us glasses of water.  And that summed up the entire evening.\n\nNow, I know this seems like a little thing, but it was a fascinating piece of service psychology.  Instead of "go to the bar and wait" it was "you\'re our guest from minute one, and we\'re going to look after you."  Honestly, we didn\'t even really need glasses of water, they were just establishing that space for us and nobody else.  Even if we didn\'t have a table yet, it was: "Right now, this is where you belong."\n\nOur choices in drinks were complimented.  Later, our choices in food were complimented.  Our waitress seemed the entire time to be assessing our level of food knowledge, without judging it.  When things arrived they were explained, but only lightly.  With our appetizer plate of pates she listed what everything was but didn\'t say "this is x, which is y made with z."  Again, they have a lot of confidence.  "We know you wouldn\'t be here with us if you didn\'t know what we were talking about."  But never cocky.  Never "you\'re lucky to be eating here."\n\nI should mention the food.  The pates were excellent, great mustard, great selection of sauces, lots of toast points.  My Chicken stuffed with Chicken sausage was expertly cooked and delicious.  They offered a side dish of marrow, which I\'d never tried before and jumped at.  It was a huge beef bone split length wise and grilled, and when I asked what kind of bone it was (one of those questions that sounds incredibly stupid the instant it leaves your mouth), our waitress treated it seriously enough to actually go back to the kitchen and ask.  Turned out it was a femur.\n\nObviously, this is a five star restaurant with very good food and impeccable service.  But when I was done with the meal and getting ready to leave, I found myself comparing this great place to others I love in the city.  If you\'ll indulge the "seduction" analogy I started earlier, I think I can classify it this way: Craigie on Main is a one night stand.  It\'s an amazing night you never forget, but it isn\'t a "form a loving partnership that lasts for years" kind of place.  No matter how many times I go back, this place is too well-done, too indulgent to ever think of as "MY place."  But for that one night, it will make you, as a diner, feel special, loved and respected all at once.  Now THAT is a smooth talking restaurant.']
["I brought my clients here for a dinner, there were eight of us. We all got the ten course meal they offer. Think it was around $120 a person. The individuals I brought have a lot of allergies and I let them know before we came, I must say the restaurant did a great job catering to the allergies. Every course was well presented and well described. Overall the service was great except for one major reason that I'm giving them three stars. One of the waitresses was a straight up bully. We didn't have any wine connoisseurs so we looked to her to recommend some good bottles. She let my clients choose between a $400 bottle and a $750 bottle without anyone knowing the price. I understand that I could have gone out of my way to ask her what the prices are but this was my most important client and I didn't want to look cheap. She could have easily just said to me, this is one of our more expensive bottles. The second bottle was $400, also pretty expensive. Anyway, this would have all been fine if she showed even a little compassion that she cost me over $3,000 for a dinner but when I said wow I didn't realize the bottles would be this expensive she just didn't care at all or show any compassion that she totally screwed me. When I said this will probably get me trouble with my company, she again just basically said shit happens (not in those words)."]
['I\'ve been to Craigie probably ten times now, and it\'s just a place that makes you feel comfortable and happy to be there. Tony Maws says he\'s a T-shirt and jeans guy who likes champagne and caviar, and it shows in his restaurant. When Craigie first moved to its Main St. location, my husband and a bunch of coworkers called them up on a Tuesday and said, "We have no reservation and we\'re not dressed nice." Craigie: "Come on over." You can propose to your girl/boyfriend or just drop in for a snack here, and it\'s not unusual for Chef Maws to bring the meal to your table himself.\n\nThere\'s several ways to eat here, depending on what you\'re after. You can do an eight-course ($118) or six-course tasting menu ($98) or a three-course a la carte ($68). You can sit at the bar and order a few snacks, or Craigie\'s famous burger, a bargain IMO at $18. Every night I\'ve been there, they\'ve offered sides of duck fat brussels or bone marrow for $10. Or you could eat my favorite way with the four-course, $45 chef\'s whim, offered on Sundays after 9 and made of whatever Maws feels like cooking (well, and needs to use up).\n\nThe wines, beers and cocktails are consistently excellent. The menu changes but the emphasize is always on sustainable, local sourcing and French influences, with Maws\'s Jewish roots coming through now and then. Some of my favorites have been the charcuterie, the grilled Spanish octopus, the house-cured fishes, the orange blossom beignets, of course that burger, and, on one whim night, crispy Chinese duck necks.\n\nThe last thing to say is that Craigie is an amazing supporter of the neighborhood, staying open to feed us when weather closes every other place. It sure is nice to come in from a blizzard to a Valrhona hot chocolate or rum punch.']
['Excellent dinner. All 3 courses were interesting. However service needs to be improved. We had to remind server to pick up our main courses. Servers do not seem well trained. Also very high markups on good wine. Markups on medium wine not too high.']
['We started with high expectations and we left with those same expectations embedded - nearly. It was a fine experience although for what we paid it nearly had to be perfect.\nWe sat at the counter overlooking the kitchen and had the privilege of watching an integrated team at work.\nWe were attentively looked after - the balance was good without being overbearing however there was a moment of real surprise after we had both choosen the eight course degustation.  The server then offered further dishes not on the "ultimate" experience! \nOnce over this the following hour and  half was real enjoyment of an array  of wonderful dishes. We varied the degust menu by substituting the Pigs Head in - our idea. We were encouraged to do this by the serving person and it was a great decision. We also added a side of mushrooms too.....delightful. The pasta with it\'s subtle flavours and the soup with crustation were the other highlights......along the way we enjoyed a complimentary cocktail.\nThe wine list is excellent and the French Cotes du Vivarais Syrah that we enjoyed balanced subtly with the dishes.\nThis dining experience is expensive however you pay for what you get. It was a dining pleasure and worth the money in nearly ever sense.Four stars, well  for the spend it was not quite perfect................']
['Came here for cocktails. The drinks were great, and the bartender lit one on fire, which is always fun!']
["Second time at Craigie, this time for its brunch. And my research showed that brunch at Craigie means two things: the house made doughnut and the burger! \n\nNow the judgement:\n\nThe doughnut: simply the BEST i have ever had. I am constantly overwhelmed by how much sugar Americans tend to put into their pastry, but this doughnut has just the right amount of sweetness. Even better than those asian cakes! The camel sauce compliments the bun so well, and the texture inside is close to a cornbread. Very very nice. You have to try it.\n\nThe burger: I am not sure if the brunch burger is the same one that everyone is raving about, since i have the feeling that most people (at least from previous reviews) got their burgers during night when eat at the bar, however the burger is a really popular order on brunch menu. It is a beautiful, beautiful burger with soft,fresh house-made buns, AMAZINGLY delectable potato wedges (the wedges are to die for) and some greens (mainly lettuce but the dressing is kind of weird), but the patty is way too dry for my taste. I was expecting something really juicy and tender, like those patties in Shake Shack's burger, especially when i heard that they mix bone marrow with the meat. Maybe it's because i asked for medium well not medium rare, or maybe it's simply because they use grass-fed beef, which we all know lacks some juiciness compared to corn-fed beef. When they came over to check upon me (i think it's the manager), i mentioned this to him and he apologized instantly and offered to make me a new one (talk about service!). Since i was already half-way done with the burger and really full (it is a big burger), i told him not to go through this trouble since it is still a pretty good burger. Later they told me the burger is on the house. Major plus. I even felt a little embarrassed about this.: )"]
['This was one of the best meals I have ever had! I could not have asked for a better birthday dinner :)\n\nThe dishes we had were very complex, yet approachable and familiar.  Amazing use of seasonal, local food with a constantly changing menu. Definitely worth a visit for a special occasion dinner in the Boston area.']
['Well, finally got a chance to try Craigie last night, after hearing so much about it. We did the Ultimate Craigie experience which was the 8 course tasting menu.\n\nHaving tried a lot of what the restaurant is about, I will say this: for the price, it\'s a solid 4 stars.\n\nThe food ranged from very good to a-maz-ing. The starting hor d\'ourves were good (plate of three tastes) but one stood out - the chilli squid roots? I think that\'s what they were. Whatever it was it was one mouthful of out of this world. Then, later, the homemade pasta with ham and crab - wow-o. Unbelievable. Everything else came in after this in terms of impressiveness, though the pigs head stood out for the experience as much as the taste.\n\nThe service was friendly and attentive. The people working there are all pretty relaxed which I personally liked. It\'s fine dining, but it\'s not too formal. Also in the positive column, there were a couple of complimentary things sent out way during the evening. Thanks guys!\n\nSo given all this, why not 5?\n\nFor the price we paid - for two people, we dropped $400 with a bottle of wine - you have to manage to make everything AMAZING, not just a good part of it. I didn\'t think it was at that standard. None of the dishes were bad - don\'t get me wrong - it\'s just they all weren\'t 5 stars.\n\nBut the thing that got me the most was this, however: after selecting the "ultimate craigie experience" of 8 courses, the first words out of our waiter\'s mouth were "would you like to get the beef bone marrow as well? how about the mushrooms?". I didn\'t quite know what to say to that. We had just opted for an 8 course tasting menu - the "ultimate experience" - and now you\'re trying to upsell us? Clearly, it\'s not ultimate enough. Craigie: if you\'re going to put something like this on your menu, please put your best foot forward. We should not be asked if we want other things because they\'re "so good tonight" - they should simply be included. This extends to the pig\'s head pancakes, which again, we had to pay extra for. That is clearly part of the zeitgeist surrounding your restaurant, so include it in the ultimate tasting menu. If you have to increase the price, fine, but the way you\'re doing it at the moment feels like I\'m being upsold at a cheap and less reputable institution.\n\nIn summary: it\'s good, but not good enough for the perfect 5 stars.']
["We had wanted to go to Craigie on the Main in search of their tasty burger that is available in the bar area (only 18 served a night). But alas, we could not get one.\n\nBut I want to first say their service and hostess were top notch. They were very accommodating and understanding why we wanted to get a burger. In the end, we just barely missed getting the last one. So we still got some apps before leaving. My sis had heard that the pig's tail was delicious. \n\nWell we ended up getting two orders of it! It was perfectly fried and very flavorful. The other item was a charcuterie plate. I remember thing everything was tasty and I wish there was  more to eat. All the stuff accompanying the meats-pickled onions, mustard etc were delicious. \n\nWe need to go back again to get our hands on that infamous burger! Totally worth a trip back there again!"]
['This is also more like 4.5 but is the best food I had in Boston. I lived in the city for a month tried many places and while this was fairly high end price wise it was worth the money. They food was diverse, it was all well prepared especially the raw fish dishes. I had the tasting menu and would recommend it to anyone who is eating here for just one go on a trip or vacation. Bartender is very talented and she was very knowledgable about whiskey which I appreciated tremendously.']
['Good reviews are boring, so I shall try to keep this brief;\nWonderful, expensive but worth it (if you can afford it) and classy (writes a European).']
["This really is a 5 star establishment. I was introduced to Craigie (when it was still on Craigie St) by my former roommate who used to be a server there. Since that first amazing experience, I've been back for a birthday meal with my parents, a birthday dinner with my girlfriend, a Chef's whim experience with roommates, and most recently, brunch yesterday. Each of these meals has been nothing short of incredible, and all shared the extreme satisfaction with the food, top notch service, and leaving the restaurant knowing that the money spent (while expensive) was well worth it.\n\nDinner is a meal that is always awesome at Craigie. It's definitely the least economical offering they have, but you need to eat right? Ranging from a la carte meals to a prix fixe and a tasting menu, the choices really depend on how hungry you are and how much you care to spend. Obviously, the more food you get, the happier you are going to be, because all of the parts of the meal are executed incredibly well, each course is better than the next.\n\nThe Chef's Whim menu (I think it's just on Sunday nights at this point) is an awesome way to taste really good food at a more affordable price for a prix fixe. You don't know what you're going to get for your three courses, you just know that it's going to be awesome. The only thing the server asks when you order the Chef's Whim is if you have any allergies, other than that the meal consists of whatever the Chef wants to make. It can involve parts of animals you wouldn't otherwise try, which makes it a delicious, adventurous event!\n\nBrunch yesterday was awesome. The coffee was flowing - delicious and strong. The bloody mary was spice well with fresh horseradish. I got the hash - made from beef cheek and beef tongue with a poached farm fresh egg. Just incredible. My girlfriend decided she was more in the mood for lunch and went with the burger. What can you say about a burger that amazing? I can't really put it into words, other than saying it was amazing! Check out Boston Burger Blog's Rich C,'s review for a better description than I can give the burger justice (http://www.yelp.com/biz/craigie-on-main-cambridge#hrid:DwJwPOolwMb_MhAQHV5odQ).\n\nThe best advice I can give about Craigie on Main is to make a reservation, and go hungry!"]
["Extraordinarily disappointing meal tonight. When I spend well in excess of $100 per person, I expect an exceptional meal, and my dinner tonight was anything but. First, the seats my wife and I sat in we're very cold, a complaint you'll virtually never hear from me. I ended up putting my jacket back on and wearing it through the meal. We also waited about 40 minutes before we had a drink order taken. That was followed by a decent appetizer and then a very cold pork entree. Additionally, my wife ate almost none of her undercooked swordfish entree. I expected so much more, and am deeply disappointed, particularly given the positive reviews that I had previously heard."]
["Eh - was actually underimpressed with the food. Not to mention, everyone working in there got that scruffy Ben Afflack in a dumb movie about Boston crime look to them. Too much facial hair close to my food? Plus, it wasn't that imaginative, given the price. Not sure i will be stopping here again."]
["I've only made it to the bar, but this place has a great vibe. I am a self-proclaimed foodie and I conduct serious restaurant research when I am away from home. This place is spot on. The food is phenomenal. I have to admit that I had the fish for dinner and then ordered the burger to take with me for the next day. The burger never made it to the hotel that night. Absolutely delicious."]
['I\'ve been here twice - I came here because my friend was in town. Her brother is a regular here. I came a second time for my birthday with a friend. She knows her food, so I thought that if my taste buds were pleased, she\'d at least like it. Duck fat roasted brussel sprouts, and bone marrow filled me up and I really thought there would be no room for the burger. The burger was huge but it was so good the steak potato fries were perfectly seasoned. Whoever gave them the title of "best burger in MA" definitely got it right.']
['There really isn\'t much more that I can say about this place that the 329 previous reviews hasn\'t already touched on.  The service is warm and inviting, as is the decor.  A meal there is expensive, but the food is well worth the price.  Craigie is one of the better dining experiences I\'ve ever had (and I\'ve been fortunate to have a lot).\n\nThe only thing I want to emphasize is how amazing the slow-roasted pig\'s head is.  The dish serves two, so you have to find someone who\'s not just willing, but excited to eat it with you.  \n\nLet me digress for a bit.  I used to think that the only people I didn\'t want to eat with are picky-eaters and vegans.  I have discovered through bitter experience that half-hearted adventurous eaters are even worse because they pretend to be open to new experiences and then half-ass it.  So, a typical meal goes something like this:\n\nMe:  "So what do you think about [interesting house specialty] on the menu?"\nHalf-Ass:  "Looks great!"\nMe:  "Are you sure?  Get whatever you want.  I\'m just being a food nerd." \nHalf-Ass:  "Nope, I\'m willing to try anything once (I\'m soooo adventurous, la-di-da), get the [interesting house specialty]."\n(food arrives ...)\nHalf-Ass takes the barest of nibbles:  "That\'s disgusting!"\nMe:  "I\'m sorry, why don\'t you get something else?"\nHalf-Ass:  "No, I\'m fine." (proceeds to tell me during the rest of my meal how disgusting she thinks the food is).\n(days later, in a conversation with other people ...)\nHalf-Ass:  "Kalun L. and I ate this [interesting house specialty].  Have you ever tried it?  You really should (I\'m soooo adventurous, la-di-da)"\n\nANYWAY, I was fortunate that my dining companion last night tackled the pig\'s head with the same gusto that I did.  The dish is amazing, smoky, sweet, rich, with crispy skin like a Peking duck, served on house-made mu-shu pancakes with hoisin sauce and a vegetable sambal.  It\'s also fun to eat.\n\nHere\'s the take-away:  \nThe service and decor at Craigie is great.\nGet the roast pig\'s head, but only if you\'re likely to appreciate it, otherwise, it\'s a waste.\nDon\'t get the pig\'s head if you can\'t eat something with a face.\nOh my God, the pig\'s head ...']
["Craigie has been my favorite restaurant for a few years but since having our little one, it's been hard to go for dinner here! Brunch a few times was good, but we decided to risk it and bring our now 3 yr old for NYE dinner. Great idea! Every course was delicious. Kampachi sashimi app, celery-root velouté w/scallop, then cod. All was excellent, though Black Forest dessert wasn't my fave. Hubby got foie and pork instead of velouté and cod. Ordered a pasta for little one which was also good, though she ate plenty off our plates. She couldn't get enough of the kampachi. We remarked that she eats a lot faster at Craigie than at home, so I guess it's her favorite restaurant too. \nService was great, friendly and efficient."]
['Shortly after I posted my initial review of Craigie, the owner contacted me personally and was genuinely upset that we had not had an amazing experience at her restaurant. She then offered to send me a gift certificate with confidence that we would receive a superb meal next time. I was really really surprised - that level of hospitality is rare, especially in fine dining. I accepted her offer, and my BF and I returned to Craigie in late February. \n\nMy only complaint for the whole meal was that our cocktails took a REALLY long time to come out. (I\'m talking 25 minutes here, we were already enjoying our appetizers when they were finally delivered). \n\nIn short: the pigs tails were one of the best things I have ever had. Totally not what I expected - deliciously crispy with interesting, well balanced flavors.  Several "amuse bouche" were delivered throughout the meal, which were always a welcome surprise. No complaints on our entrees, either. The chartreuse syrup on the chocolate dessert we had was a really cool idea, too. \n\n(side note: As a cook, I always find it really disappointing to hear the staff being verbally berated by their chef - especially in an open kitchen. It seems tacky. Pursuit of perfection is one thing - total disrespect is something entirely different. I applaud the rest of the staff for holding their tongues and maintaining professionalism.)\n\nI\'ll give Craigie 5 stars for Boston; however if it were in NYC, Chicago, LA, or most other places,  I\'d say only 4 stars. Still worth checking out.']
['Had the 6 course tasting menu, was worried it might be too much food but it is just perfect. Every dish is thoughtfully and carefully prepared. Great service. I think the Scottish trout was my favorite dish.']
['This is a great restaurant.  The food is really innovative, presented professionally (complete with amuse bouche), and the meal was just an overall great experience.  \n\nA couple highlights:\n-homemade pasta with boudin noir ragout: the flavor of the ragout was extraordinary\n-yogurt sorbet: this was a sorbet that was yogurt flavored, and it was oddly delicious']
["Went here for a birthday dinner with family. Opted to do the whole shebang tasting menu. I will say that the majority of the food was absolutely creative, delicious, well prepared, and thoughtful. However, great food isn't the only part of a great meal. \n\nHere is where i deduct fractions of a star from Craigie: We were never offered cocktail menus, and i was insaaaanely jealous of the awesome looking cocktails that went out to tables around us. Yeah the two bottles of wine we had were great, but i love pre-wine cocktails, and i was not facillitated in getting one.  Despite discussing meat and meat free amuse bouches, we were never brought one at all. Which was disappointing. The side of the evening was roasted bone marrow, we jumped all over that. Unfortunately, waiting with quite bated breath, it never came. I was deprived of my meat jelly experience! There was much wailing and gnashing of teeth over this. Also, it doesn't effect the rating negatively,  but i was confused why the first 4 courses of an 8 course menu were all fish. Seemed very fish heavy, but it is summer i suppose. \n\nPositives: staff was pleasant and informative, nice wine list, the assortment of desserts for our final course was really nice, we all got to try different things and share around. Nice to see an open kitchen, and how focused their team is. I was fascinated by the pull down food heaters at their expo station. We were all pleasantly surprised when Tony Maws came out to say hello.\n\nAh! Final point of contention: The chairs Craigie supplies for you to sit on, for a 3 hours multi-course tasting menu are torturous. No amount of adjusting, squirming, or talking walks between courses could bring a semblance of comfy feeling to my bum. Dead leg by the end of the meal is not pleasant. \n\nOverall though, i really did enjoy the dining experience!"]
['Consider my mind..... blown.\n\nLike Paula Dean always says, "Mmmmm...mm.mmMm.MMMM."\n\n"Mmmm."\n\n10 Course tasting menu. \'Nuff said.\n\nCraigie on Main will change your life.']
["A solidly gourmet meal that may or may not live up to expectations.\n\nCraigie has been on our Restaurant Bucket List since it was the Craigie Street Bistro.  After finally coming around to it again, we decided to give it a try for a post-Christmas / early New Years meal.   The expectations were high given that this place is always on the Best of Boston List and scored one of the highest of Phantom Gourmet (before they switched to only reviewing oohhy---gooyey pizza and burger places).\n\nSetting: Casual, romantic, french farmhouse inspired.  The kitchen is open, so you can see the young chef staff working furiously on your meals.   It was nice to see owner Tony Maws keeping it real and actually cooking in the kitchen (and not off doing some celebrity chef television show).\n\nFood:  They make a big point to stress that this is a farm to table restaurant with very fresh and local ingredients.   The front of the menu lists all of the farms the meats and veggies come from.   We tried the 3-course prix fix (versus the 7-course tasting menu) since we had a late evening reservation.   The appetizers were outstanding (spanish octopus and then mushrooms with sweetbreads) that were cooked perfectly.   The entrees were of excellent quality (venison and then trout), but nothing that really set it apart from other quality farm to table restaurants in the city.   And that's what cost Craigie the 5 star rating.   This place has superb quality and cooking technique, but I feel like you have some truly innovative expensive restaurants out there pushing the envelope, and making Craigie feel...ordinary.\n\nDrinks: The wine list is exclusively European, with a heavy dose of French.  We know our way around Californian, Australian, and even South African wines, but French leaves us lost.   The descriptions of the wine are also non-existent (it's almost like they expect you to know all about them), and the prices are high ($48 - $250 for a bottle).   Luckily, you can order by the glass (which we did considering we couldn't agree on a bottle).   \n\nService:  Our waiter was a true professional, and was proud of the restaurant and it's reputation.  He helped us through the wine list (though always suggesting some of the priciest wines).   The only small gaffe was that he send a glass of wine to the table with dinner that I had considered, but never officially ordered.  Also, I should note they have great hosting and valet service.\n\nOverall, I really like Craigie...it's quality, conservative, farm-friendly, and remains true to it's original mission.   I just wish it took a few more chances or pushed the envelope slightly more with some risky culinary combinations.   For some people, this is all they'd ever want in a high quality meal, but for me at the price...I like a little more adventure in my meal."]
["Craigie was one of the first restaurants I fell in love with when I moved to Cambridge. It's lively, not too pretentious, and the menu is very interesting. If you're like me, and you're not very good at choosing between equally delicious-sounding options, try the chef's whim or the tasting menu: you won't be disappointed, because everything that is served here is daaaamn tasty. Sometimes, almost too tasty (yes, there is such a thing)! This place is about unsubtle, bold, loud and proud flavors. The portions are not particularly large, but maybe because they are so flavorful, they feel dense and sit heavy, especially for dinner. One last thing: if I had to choose a meal to eat here, I'd pick Sunday brunch, because the doughnut they offer is orgasmic/out-of-this-world."]
["If there is an afterlife, I hope it's a bar. I specifically hope it's this bar, and I say this because I think that the cocktails are actually crafted by god. \n\n I was tipsy from just one Mezcal drink called the Loose Translation. For my second drink I asked for another Mezcal creation, but didn't want anything from the cocktail list. I let our waiter know I didn't want anything too sweet, and the barkeep sent over an Indian Summer: Mezcal, Green Cardamom, Homemade Pineapple Syrup, Pimms, and a twist of lime. There are not words for the level of satisfaction I experienced sipping this masterful concoction, so I won't even bother. \n\nMy date and I attended this Sunday's Chef's Whim and had the 6 course tasting menu. From Cod Balls to Sweetbread to some crazy banana custard, everything was phenomenal. (Sweetbread is not brains as it turns out, but the thalamus gland. Of what I'm not sure but I think it was veal, and at any rate I still feel like less of a zombie...) Basically sh!t I would never have ordered off of a menu no matter how good the restaurant was supposed to be. I ate all of it. It took me 2.5 hours or so, but it was worth every bite, and every minute. \n\nThe waiters were actually so good, I'm surprised the bill didn't come with an optional happy ending.  They were precise, knowledgeable, courteous, friendly, and their execution was so impeccable, I would have eaten sweetbread if they put it in front of me. Wait, I did. \n\nYay for culinary adventuring! (But I think that the cocktails were actually better than the food which was pretty top notch.) We are going back for the Bartender's tasting menu as soon as we recover. I can't wait to see the bar menu!\n\nIn my opinion, this is the best restaurant in Boston. Thank you all for making my evening flawless."]
['Second time having brunch at this place. The first time was a more formal occasion whereas this time it was a smaller group and we took counter seats. At first I was reluctant to sit at the counter but it ended up being a great choice. The counter looks right into the kitchen and it was lovely and warm and bright. We all started with the homemade donut and then I chose the whole wheat pancakes with fruit. The pancakes and fruit were delicious but I could only finish half after that donut. We also ordered a side of the potato galette, which is like a slice of magic fried hashbrown pie. Coffee was great, service was excellent and I felt like I was on the Food Network with our front row seats to the kitchen.']
['In Short:  A restaurant with great aspirations to cuisine, but which falls short by relying on ingredients with no real thought to composition and flavor harmonies.  Unremarkable waitstaff and an ungenerous kitchen.\n\nMy Girlfriend and I decided to celebrate a year and a half together with a dinner at Craigie on Main.  We had the 10 course tasting menu.  I don\'t usually do this, but I want to throw in the disclaimer that I am comparing this experience to Eleven Madison Park, which may just be unfair.\n\nI will not go into the individual dishes, both because that would be extremely long and the dishes are constantly rotating, so there is no guarantee you would ever get any of them again.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed is that there was a MASSIVE variety in the sizes of the plates.  The first three were absolutely tiny (think about 4sq")  and I found myself gorging on bread so that I wouldn\'t have to try and find late-night food in Somerville.  Then came dish four which was the cheek of some massive fish (were talking a meal of meat on its own).  By the end I was so full that I found myself merely tasting the dish because I simply couldn\'t eat anymore.\n\nThe dishes themselves were obviously made from very high quality ingredients.  That seems to be this place\'s shtick.  The scallop sashimi was divine and had a hint of the vinigeriness of ceviche.  Yet none of them transcendent the sum of its parts to create a greater whole.  The fish cheek was overpowered by a chili-oil sauce.  The first course, a collection of three amuse bouche each was a bit interesting, but they didn\'t play off of each other in a way that would explain why they were served as a single dish. \n\nThe wait staff was casual, but not unpleasantly so.  I, however, am used to giving my tastes at the beginning of a chef\'s tasting menu and I am used to having the kitchen at least consider them.  For example, I love lamb and all lamb related products, and when I told my waitress this, her face read "So?  Then you should have ordered lamb."  Now maybe that is more of an issue of restaurant policy than my waitress and maybe I am being unfair.  I also told her I loved bone marrow.  However, rather than having bone marrow as a course, it was brought out as  $20 10th  course (wedged between 6 and 7) and was served so late in the night that I had trouble really appreciating the texture and flavor because of how full I had become.  \n\nA quick note on the deserts.  One was simply a slice of the a la carte cake and the other was a thimbleful of hot chocolate.  Neither was great and both were frankly disappointing.\n\nNow maybe this seems harsh, but I think that if you are going to offer a $115 10 course chef\'s tasting menu, there better be some good thought going into it and you better come out of it feeling like a king.  It didn\'t and I didn\'t.']
["I've had several delicious meals here, both for brunch and dinner. In addition, this place is very accommodating and respectful of those with celiac disease. This was the first place that I dined at after being diagnosed and the servers were so knowledgeable that they ended up educating me. Could not recommend this place enough!"]
['How\'s the food? \nJulia F: I couldn\'t tell you. Didn\'t get any. The plan was to eat dessert there and have a few drinks..\n\nWhy\'s that?\nJulia F: I couldn\'t be seated.\n\nWho told you that? \nJulia F: The woman at the front door. Gotta tell you, I was less than impressed with the presentation, and the communication was less than desirable. \n\nWhat did you do next?\nJulia F: We waited "first in line" as some sort of fire hazard, lined up making the ramp connecting the bar area and the kitchen impassable. \n\nDid you find this upsetting?\nJulia F: Greatly. We weren\'t told upon arrival that only people who had reservations for dinner (at 10pm?) were the only ones who could sit at the tables (of which there were two available upon our arrival...) had we known that, we may have made an informed decision to stand in the way of the second means of egress, or leave.\n\nWhat did you end up buying? \nJulia F: Two caipirinhas, which we had to ask for simple syrup to doctor the oppressive lime taste out of, shortly after we received them. Not only had we JUST left a bar that made them PERFECTLY, but these specific drinks took an AGE and a half to get to our hot little hands...\n\nAnything that you did or didn\'t like that you\'d like to add to this?\nJulia F: The space is nice. I really like what they\'ve done with it. The open kitchen is a nice concept, I wish the bar was larger, or the seating area around the bar were broken up a little bit so that while you waited to be seated you didn\'t feel like a loitering bum on a handicap ramp.\n\n The service needs to step it up a little bit with the communication with patrons.    There were two ladies, neither of them told us why there would be people seated before we were, until we stopped one of them and asked. I may come back, if I can get myself to a table -  but it\'s fairly to very unlikely. I SO wanted to be wowed, but in a very different way.']
["One of THE BEST dinners we've experienced. Rivals Eleven Madison Park in creativity and is (at least i think) in a more comfortable space ... who needs to feel stuffy when eating?! \n\nLoved doing the 6 course tasting that we helped build with the chef. Everything was incredible, but the squid noodles were off the chart. It will be a splurge, but its SO worth it. Boys, take your lady (or guy) here for your next special occasion."]
["Wonderful service, interesting people, delicious food and drink.  While their cocktails are magnificent, I wouldn't mind a more extensive and varied beer selection.  \n\nMore than enough has been said about the burger but I can't help myself.  The Craigie burger is an edible celebration of the cow.  Were I a cow, I would be honored to give myself to this burger."]
["I came here yesterday for Sunday brunch and had an amazingly enjoyable meal. Arrived 30 min early for a noon reservation and we were seated in 15 after enjoying some of the best coffee I've had while standing by the bar. Service was extremely attentive throughout the meal, and the manager came over to chat half way through the meal. \n\nI got the burger which had a wonderfully buttery flavor, I guess due to the added bone marrow. Came with fries (good, not amazing) and a simple salad (delicious and perfect to counter the very heavy burger and fries) as well as house-made ketchup, pickles, and slaw. My one complaint about the burger is that it was next to impossible to eat with my hands. I took two bites and realized it just wasn't going to happen and resorted to the knife and fork, making me feel a bit affected and snobby. \n\nI also ordered the doughnut with dulce de leche which was truly amazing. Tasted kind of like a high-class funnel cake. \n\nFor dessert I got the light-as-air and silky smooth sour milk panna cotta, which I highly recommend. \n\nOverall, a great experience and wonderful food."]
['A review of the late-night 6 course tasting menu ($57). I\'m a foodie, my date was a...newbie.\n\nWe enjoyed the meal tremendously. This isn\'t Michelin quality, but they\'re not going for that flawless, neurotic perfection. Meat, fowl, or fish - they employ the very best techniques. Not every side sauce will be perfect, nor will every microgreen stand magically on its narrow stem. Focus on the goods, and you\'ll have a great time.\n\nService specifics...\n\nThe front-house staff noticed us staring at the pass, so they found us two rink-side seats. Much appreciated!\nWe ordered drinks while we waited. I asked for a bourbon recommendation, and they made a great choice.\nBeyond that, our service was good, not great. I relish interacting with knowledgeable servers, and I was grateful for every course introduction we received. Later, we were asked, "How was your___?" What this really meant was, "Do you have any complaints?" I made the mistake of attempting to discuss the merits of each dish; it was clear our server had other places to be.\n\nFood specifics...\n\nBluefin amuse and Duck rillette - forgettable. The duck featured an fatty goo on the rim, which was more a commentary on fowl than a good idea. The mustard was the standout.\nFried clams w squid ink - you weren\'t craving them, but they\'re the best fried clams you\'ll ever have.\nSwordfish - couldn\'t be more tender or juicy. I craved a crispy skin, but I got that with the...\nPork Two Ways - an ode to an amazing creature. Spice crusted rib and a crispy crackling. Delicious.\nChanterelle mushrooms - how did they acquire that lovely taste of sage (rosemary)?\nSweet corn and buttermilk ice cream - what a terrific idea! My date doesn\'t like corn but loved this.\nHer dessert: something with chocolate (great!), white chocolate ice cream (great!), and a sauce that lacked the tingency to be a factor\nMy dessert: corn grits with a berry sauce and anise ice cream. This is a very good idea that ought to be refined. I love the combination of warm and cold. The ice cream, if you like anise, was lovely. Berries - can\'t go wrong. But the brulee on the grits didn\'t come through - too much going on. The grits did for this dessert what rice does for teriyaki - provide a staple base for the sauce on top. But why would you need that after a 5 courses?\n\nA very good meal, with minor flaws. It\'s certainly worth more than the $57/head they charged.']
["So I finally made it to Craigie.  After all the hype and amazing reviews, I can't say that I was blown away like I expected to be.  The boyfriend and I chose the 10 course tasting.  I will say the service is a solid five stars.  Sam was incredible, checking in at just the right times and just frequently enough to make us feel like we were his only table, but not too frequently to bug us.  His pacing of our meal was also great and he made great wine pairings with the meal.  The chef did stop by the table to serve up the last meat course, which was quite nice.\n\nAs for the meal, I would imagine that the 6 course tasting would be a better value and more impressive than the 10 course that we had.  After hearing so much about Chef Tony's love for the pig (we absolutely love Kevin Gillespie's Woodfire Grill in Atlanta for this reason), we were disappointed that only one of the courses featured pork.  The first four or five (I can't remember now) courses featured seafood, which I didn't mind, but I don't feel it showed off the chef's strengths.  Although I will say the squid noodles were the best showing of the night.  As part of the first course, I just couldn't get it out of my head and perhaps that spoiled my view of the rest of the courses.  \n\nDon't get me wrong, all of the food was cooked and seasoned wonderfully, but I would have liked to see what everyone else is raving about.  Sam told us that we could suggest some items off the menu that we might like to see, but after asking for the raw oysters (they can't add that) and the pig's tail (chef said he was already featuring pork), we just went with what the chef chose to serve up.  The couple next to us got the bone marrow and loved it, so perhaps that's the next thing to try.\n\nThe desserts were great.  We had a sour milk pudding that was absolutely delicious, and a frozen yogurt with beet that was quite good also.  Although assured by Sam that the portions were not that big, it was quite tough to make it through all 10 courses.  Perhaps the portions could be sized down just a bit more for the 10 course option.\n\nAll in all, it was a fine meal, but nothing that blew us away.  The amuse bouche that is typically offered with a tasting meal was absent, which was somewhat disappointing.  The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice, intimate but not too much so.  The open kitchen was also really great to see.  If we return, we will either order off the menu to pick exactly what we have heard is the best of show or perhaps try the 6 course Chef's Whim.  I'm still looking for all five of those stars."]
['On Saturday, 4/26, I dined at Craigie On Main. It was my first time ever dining at the lauded restaurant and the experience left me rather disappointed and unsure if I\'d go back. \n\nAs a party of 8 women, we had an 8:30pm reservation but had to wait approximately 45 minutes (in heels) to be seated. Of note, the staff offered us sparkling wine, which without their saying it, we took as an apology for having kept us waiting, corralled in a tight, inconvenient space where we were bumped about and shuffling out of passers-bys\' ways.  \n\nThere is some sort of confusion about where we were supposed to be seated as my friend who made the reservations was under the impression that we were going to be seated in the dining room; however, it became clear that they were setting us up in the bar area. As she attempted to discuss the situation, my friend said that the hostess was rude, impatient, and dismissive.\n\nFinally seated, our experience improved significantly.  We had a serving duo with one of them Jeremy, a new server, who was particularly attentive and pleasant.  At about 9:40pm, about 20 mins after being seated and 70+ mins of waiting, I had to ask our female server if we could put in our food order, to which happily obliged.  When someone ordered the hogshead, she appropriately alerted them that it would take about 45 mins to prepare. \n\nAll of us quite enjoyed our appetizers as they were served rather quickly and were enticing. Additionally, the the hogsheads came up in the window of time she stated.  Unfortunately, the hogsheads was not a hit with the women who ordered it but the staff was quick to remove it from the table and from the check, offering other food options for my friends. I was impressed by the gracious and swift handling of this situation. And as for me, my sirloin was cooked perfectly and was delicious. So what had started off as a frustrating experience, made a full turn throughout dinner. Unfortunately, it was during the dessert course that the "wheels fell off the wagon" once again. \n\nFor dessert, my friend prepaid for one of Craigie\'s cake. The brought it out and presented it to the table, but then took it back to cut it. At this point, it then took about another 30 mins for them to cut and serve the cake, which seemed excessive and only fanned the previously weaning flames fire of frustration, though not specifically for me. Instead, I had my own separate issues of frustration and very poor service. \n\nWhile waiting for the cake, I asked the female server what teas they had, she just named "black, green, and herbal." I was surprised at her response but politely asked her to be specific about the herbal teas. She initially stated they only had only two herbal teas, a red zen and a rooibos, but then added that there was a third blended tea. I said I\'d hope for something fruitier but I\'d take the red zen.  About a min later, I asked our other server, Jeremy, for the dessert menu so I could see it since I\'d never dined there. Jeremy brought the menu back immediately and I saw that there were about 6 different herbal teas, specifically they had a simple hibiscus tea, something I mentioned I\'d like, to the female server.  Jeremy called her over and I asked her if she\'d already put my order in for the tea because I actually wanted the hibiscus instead. She told me it was okay and that she would update the order, however, only mins later she returned with a pot of tea, poured it, lied to me when I specifically asked if it was the hibiscus tea (she said it was) and sharply responded to me that "it was fine" when I asked if it had enough time to steep, and then walked away and did not return. I asked Jeremy to come over and verify that I received the correct tea, because it appeared to be the red zen. He took it to the kitchen and returned with the correct tea, apologizing for the other server\'s mistake. \n\nI can not say if this server either made a simple mistake, mistakenly underestimated my knowledge of tea to know the difference, or if she is working as a lead server but does not know Craigie\'s featured teas.  Yet, this whole tea exchange was the tipping point for me and my personal experience there. \n\nThroughout the evening, I anticipated moments of waiting since we were a large party. I also appreciated that the management tried to offer some sort of amends for keeping us waiting for so long. Furthermore, I was happy with my meal and found the food worthy of a positive review.  The service to our large party, on the other hand, was deplorable.  \n\nI write this review unsure of whether a large parties happens to be Craigie on Main\'s Achilles heel or if the fact that our particularly diverse, large party played some part in us receiving poor service. Most of the other women in our group do not share my concerns as to the reason we received such service, but we all undeniably agree that our service was unacceptable (with the clear exception of Jeremy).']
["One word.  Overrated...........Overrated.  Overrated.  The people over booked(even though we took a later time)  and the food is not worth it.  Actually two words.  Overrated, pretentious.  The three stars are for Travis who was a great waiter and turned around a 300$ cluster f$$$.  The bartender asked for an opinion he clearly didn't want(wise crack remark to my girlfriend and walked away before I can smack your stupid bow tie in circles).  The dessert however was fantastic.  I want something I CAN'T make at home!  We were so disappointed.  My suggestion is to not try and make 30 different things mediocrely and make 10 things amazingly.., but hey what do I know I've just been everywhere."]
["My husband and I went to Craigie on Main to celebrate our first anniversary and we couldn't have been happier with our choice.  It is a great restaurant that really knows how to take care of their diners.  For starters it felt like we were being served by every worker in the restaurant.  At one point Chef Tony Maws came out himself to present the last of our 6 course meal. Both Jon and I thought that the staff and service were top notch.\n\nNow for the food.  Everything we had was super delicious.  I don't know if it's too helpful describing what we ate since their menu changes all the time based on what's in season.  However I will say that they sure know how to cook and appreciate pork.  Also, the 6 course tasting menu was a perfect choice for us since it was our first time there.  It was a good mix of dishes on their menu and those made special by the chef.  If it is your first time there or if you are just being indecisive, I highly recommend it.\n\nWhat sealed the deal for us was the complimentary dessert we got to help us celebrate our anniversary.  It was a thoughtful, classy touch that left us completely satisfied and feeling all warm and fuzzy."]
["Came here the other day with my girlfriend for the Chef's Whim. We got the 4 course option because we weren't expecting the courses to be as small as they were. First course was squid noodles which were interesting, but probably the weakest part of dinner. Next we had a sashimi, I don't remember what kind of fish it was, but it was very good. Each course was better than the next. The third course was fried clams. They were really delicious and the squid ink sauce they came with was amazing. Lastly, we had pork three ways. Each style was delicious and the sauces accompanying them were great as well. \n\nFor dessert they brought us random dessert. My girlfriend got a chocolate tobacco dessert which looked really really cool and I was given an almond lemon bar dessert which didn't look too great. At first sight, I was not excited. After tasting both desserts it seemed like mine was much better! They were both very odd and a picky eater probably would not have liked either, but I thought they were both good, although the desserts at L'Espalier at much better, these were enjoyable. \n\nDuring the dinner I also had a couple of cocktails. First, I had the Northern Lights which was very good and although I don't like citrus much I thought they made it work very well. Second, I had the drink under the Northern Lights. I don't remember what it's called and it's not on their website, but it was made with gin. The waitress assured me you couldn't taste it, but the gin made the drink dry which I personally did not like. The drink was very cool though it had a large cube of ice with a blood orange on top of it. After dessert my girlfriend had a cappuccino which was also very tasty, but nothing incredible."]
['We love to try new restaurants and especially experience tastings with creative chefs.  We have lived in 4 countries and eaten at the best restaurants both domestically and internationally.  The tasting we had at the chefs counter was clearly one of the best meals we have ever experienced.']
['I went to Craigie almost a month ago, on June 29th (My amazing boyfriend, Sahil G., took me there for my 21st birthday -- read his review too!). It\'s clearly taken me awhile to write this review, but the thing is, I can still taste the food. The flavors of all the amazing things I ate at Craigie are permanently imprinted in my mind and my mouth. Hands down, my meal at Craigie was the most memorable of my life (yes, I know I\'m young, but still - it was extraordinary).\n\nSahil G. and I arrived about 5 minutes before our 7 PM reservation, and the very friendly hostess directed us to the bar for a drink while our table was prepared. Within seconds a waiter came to give us a cocktail menu, and then returned soon to take our order (Hendrick\'s gimlet for me, Sazerac for Sahil G.). Not soon after, the hostess came over and said that there had been a cancellation at the chef\'s table, did we want it? Um, YES. \n\nWe sat down at the Chef\'s Table -- bar seating right in front of the kitchen -- and our waiter came over to offer us water and drinks. We told him that we had put in an order at the bar, and he promised to go get him. I wish I remembered our waiter\'s name, because he definitely deserves compliments! He is tall, with medium length blonde hair. He was extremely attentive and polite. \n\nAbout five minutes later, another hostess came over to us with our drinks, which she told us had been comped because of the wait. I honestly felt that the wait was reasonable, but this is just a testament to the outstanding service that all of the wait staff at Craigie provides. The free drinks made me feel appreciated and important, which is exactly how you want to feel when dining at a nice restaurant (though sadly, this is often not the case). \n\nSahil G. and I had originally planned to do the 4-course prix fixe menu, but since we were seated at the Chef\'s Table, we felt obligated (both to the staff and ourselves) to see what they could do with the tasting menu. We told our waiter we had no dietary restrictions -- we wanted Chef Maws and his staff to give us whatever they wanted to. \n\nThe food was unbelievably good, and while the actual meal was "6 courses," it actually ended up being 9 when you factor in the amuse bouches, etc. In order, we received:\n\nSeafood three ways (Squid noodles, smoked halibut, cod fritter)\nHalibut ceviche with lemon oil and dehydrated corn\nFried frogs legs with chorizo\nRabbit and ancho chile filled pasta (this dish was my absolute favorite, hands down...I still dream about it, and I swear if I could pick my last meal it would be this)\nVeal sweatbreads with hominy\nDuck two ways -- confit and tea smoked breast\nblackberry and plum sorbet\nsheepsmilk yogurt cheesecake with blackberry tequila compote\nsweet corn grits with brown sugar, raspberry compote, and anise ice cream\nrhubarb hibiscus foam with yogurt\n\nEach dish was brought out by a waiter or manager who explained what was in the dish and how it was prepared -- and Chef Maws came out to explain the duck two ways, which was very cool. I could go on for hours, literally, about how good this food was, but I will refrain. You just have to go and eat there yourself.\n\nMy experience at Craigie was unforgettable. The food was out of this world, and so was the service. I absolutely cannot wait to go back there.']
['I have been living very cose to Craigie on Main for a few years. All that time, I thought the restaurant was a random low-scale (up-scale wanna be) place. Little did I know that it was actually a quite famous upscale place.\n\nCheck out my girlfriend\'s blog. She has some really nice pictures of what we had!\nhttp://beanosbeantown.blogspot.com/2013/12/new-orleans-and-craigie-on-main.html\n\nI heard from a few friends that the place is actually quite nice and especiall the bar was pretty nice. I went there a few days ago with my girlfriend to check out their bar. We went around 10pm, well after we had dinner. The place was still pretty packed both with pople having dinner as well as grabbing drinks. As soon as you walk in, you can see their "open kitchen" and see all the chefs working busily, which I especially liked. Everybody from the host, waiters/waitresses, bar tenders were very nice and welcoming.\n\nWe had to wait a bit for the bar. There were only about 10 seats or so at the bar and it is first-come-first-serve. My girlfriend had a cocktail called sunrise something... and it was probably the most delicious cocktail I have ever tried. I had a somewhat dirty martini and it was excellent as well. We also tried their $18 cheese platter... but I didn\'t like it too much. 3 not so large slices of cheese and they were ok. Nothing special.\n\nWe heard so so much about their famous burgers from friends. (Presumably the best burger in Boston if not in the whole U.S.) We were so curious that we returned the next day to try their burger and bone marrow.\n\nKey is to come for an early dinner. They open at 5:30PM on Saturdays so we went right around 5:20 and waitied. The door was actually locked and we were the first in line. Within a few minutes, people started lining up. They all looked like they were coming for the burger.\n\nOnce we got in and took a seat the bar we ordered a burger with a fried egg and bacon. Price = $19 + $3 (egg) + $3 (bacon). Bone marrow ($10) had 3 pieces of oven roasted (?) with salt and pepper + maybe some spices.\n\nTo be honest... the burger was just ok. It was definitely rich. Not too big in size, but a bit tall. But it feels like it lacks.... something. It doesn\'t taste that special. Some might not agree, but I actually would prefer shake shack or in-n-out or one of those burgers over Craigie on Main. The bone marrows were pretty good. Pretty good portion actually for $10. Very rich but I guess that\'s bone marrow.\n\nOverall... The ambience is good. Some cocktails are quite good. Burger is just ok.\n\nI will update if I save enough money to try their regular dinner menu. Hopefully the 8 course tasing? :)']
["By the grace of the heavens I was able to come here while in Boston on a work trip.  Who am I kidding, I would have paid for it anyway!  I managed to score a random table on a whim (at opening time there were two tables left for the whole night on a Thursday), and I'm so glad I did.  We did the eight-course tasting and ordered a bottle of wine.  Pre-dinner, waiting for the table to be available, we had a cocktail with sage called an Arboise (I think) and it was delicious.  We hand-muddled the sage leaf a bit and it was even better.  The wine was of fantastic quality.\n\nThe dinner was just amazing.  I was concerned it would be pork-heavy given the fact that I watched someone torch half of a pig's face in the kitchen (yes, really did), but the chef presented us actually with mostly seafood, which I thought was great.  And I learned something - the Tasmanian trout looks like salmon.  You know it's a successful dinner when you're full, happy, a little tipsy, and you're smarter than when you went in!\n\nI won't describe every course, but every bite was worth it.  Things I didn't think I would like (I like seafood in theory but rarely in fact), I loved.  I loved all of it.  We never wanted it to end.  If I had to pick a favorite, which would be difficult, it would be the rye tube pasta with the mushroom sauce.  It's nearly an eight-way tie however...everything was just amazing.  Never have had panna cotta that perfect in consistency and flavor.  I didn't know you could neutralize the stank of pate with chilled lobster.  The whole thing was totally worth the money, for sure.\n\nThe really special thing about this place is that it's not all stuffy and pretentious.  Even the layout is designed to be open and effortlessly cool; the first thing you encounter when you come in is the open kitchen where you can see everybody working and just marvel at it all.  We came in wearing jeans and didn't feel out of place at all, but neither did the more formally dressed.  All staff, from hostess to the guy opening the door when you leave, were super nice and friendly, and seemed genuinely so and not just faking it for the dollars.  Chef even came out to our table to discuss one dish and introduce himself, and he seemed really nice, cool, and welcoming.  Our waiter made great chit-chat with us, talking to us and joking about different wines and courses, which really made the experience fun as well as high end.  Yes, you can have it all!  And at what I consider to be an excellent value!"]
["Craigie is very expensive, but it's totally worth saving up for a special occasion. I loved the service and the ambiance - it was relaxing and calming and the staff were very friendly and down to earth (I love that they wear jeans). \n\nWe had the six course tasting menu, and it was paced very well. Although I didn't personally love the first three dishes (although the person I dined with thought they were superb), I still give it five stars based on the overall experience, the quality of the entree and dessert (phenomenal!) and the wonderful wine advice from our waiter (he suggested a surprisingly affordable wine that went with everything very well).  Sure I winced a little at the price tag, but I can't wait to go back. :)"]
["Go on a Sunday night at 9 pm (if you don't mind eating late the day before work) and get the Chef's Whim (4 to 6 course tasting menu). My fiance and I finally went here after hearing so many things about Craige on Main. We were not disappointed! The food was great! And the wine was also excellent. The service is also attentive and we were overall really satisfied with our meal. The bill was really high (to be expected) so don't go if you're not ready to spend a decent bit. It's a great place to take a date since not only is the food and wine great, the atmosphere is really nice too - very intimate and cozy (even though it's not that small)."]
["I dined at Craigie on Saturday night with my grandparents (yes, it seemed the most affordable route).  Everyone I have spoken to had nothing but praise for the establishment and I truly looked forward to trying it out.  Overall I have no complaints.  I was aware going in that this was a very expensive restaurant so I wasn't super shocked by $18.00 apps and $37.00 entrees.  We ended up getting a last minute reservation in the lounge.  It was fine, I've enjoyed better lounge type dining but I don't think I've had better lounge service.  \n\nFrom the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by extremely friendly waitstaff, our coats were taken for us, and our table was ready immediately.  Our server was very friendly and helpful yet not overbearing and she dealt with my grandparents well who can be a bit old-fashioned.  \n\nThe oysters I ordered were delicious.  I was hesitant at first because they were described as coming with a candied lemon topping, which threw me, but they really pulled it off.  The wine I had was also very good but for $12.00 per glass they were a little on the smaller side.  All of our entrees were wonderful and cooked perfectly.  This is the kind of place you might want to go if you have the extra cash and you really want to impress your first date, but I would say, call in advance and try to get a seat in the dining area.  As good as this experience was, I probably can't afford to go back except possibly for a drink and I'm okay with that."]
["A friend with a gift card offered to take me to Craigie on Main, so I was glad to take him up on a free dinner. Oh man, was I glad I did. This wonderful restaurant restored my faith in Boston dining. The grilled octopus appetizer was out of this world. The tender, almost dough-like octopus left me wondering what I've been eating all these years. Then, organic Vermont pork done three ways left me feeling like the chef timed the dish perfectly. Three pieces of pork, each cooked just right, each with it's own signature flavor. Dessert was a most mouth-watering fruit cobbler. Peaches, cherries and other summer fruits a la mode was heaven. Paired with a delicious dessert wine, this prix fix was right on. \n\nHonestly, every plate I saw that emerged from one of the most professional open kitchens I've seen made me want to return. Pricey, yes. But my buddy with the gift card?  That's a true friend."]
["The rating speaks for itself. I was very impressed with the quality of food and service. We got the 6-course tasting menu which surpassed any expectations I had of this place. I've always heard really good things and have read rave reviews but now I could actually attest to the great testimonials. \n\nIt is highly suggested to make reservations because the place is not that big and it is always packed. Also, it is worth spending a bit more to get the tasting menu. The servings are not that big so if you are worried about not being able to handle all that food, I wouldn't worry. \n\nBon appetit!"]
["Great service, lovely interior, and fabulous food.  Five stars all around!\n\nI visited Craigie on Main for a special occasion dinner and we had the six course chef's choice.  Here is our meal: 1) Smoked bluefish with caviar, 2) Raw bluefin tuna with fresh cucumber and beets, 3) Swordfish wrapped in guarcino in a French curry with garbanzo beans, 4) Grilled scallop with a summer squash potage, 5) Pork three ways (blood sausage, belly, and something I can't remember), 6) Apricot tarte with amaretto ice cream and a fresh panna cotta.\n\nAmazing!  Unfortunately I don't like seafood very much (I knew I would be faced with many seafood options ahead of time) but each course was presented well and paired well with the wine we ordered.  The service was polite, professional, and cheerful.\n\nLoved my evening at Craigie and will definitely return!"]
["So I ended up back at Craigie on Main, after taking a spell away after a pretty mixed experience (some fantastic food incomparable to other places, some middling over priced dishes, and very odd customer service) while my friend Hannah was in town.\n\nThe glue that binds Hannah and I together the fact that will eat just about anything, that weekend included two types of beef stomach, pigs ears, rabbit liver, beef tendon, pigs intestines, durian pudding (nauseous yet?), chicken feet, and more.  A.K.A. a typical weekend when we get together.\n\nCraigie fit right in.  So Hannah, Damon, and I hit up Craigie for a mix of reasons; nose to tail dining was definitely one of the biggest ones. \n\nI'll admit, I should have written this review sooner because I can't remember all of what we ordered (but I could certainly tell you what I thought if you reminded me of what it was), though I suppose it'd be off the menu anyway...\n\nGiven there were 3 of us, and we were def't going to be sharing everything, we wanted a table.  It was a Sunday night, so we figured it wouldn't be too hard to drop in, but we called ahead to make sure, asking if we could make a reservation for 3 in the bar area, they said they didn't take reservations but it should be fine to get a table at the bar space.  \n\nWe got there and they said to just get our selves to the bar area, where we did... There were a couple of tables free there, so we sat down at one only to be informed of them being occupied.  We reminded them of our call, but had to sit at the bar anyway.  \n\nThankfully I was acquainted with one of the waitresses, who said a table may be opening up soon but we could relax at the bar, muse about our orders, and enjoy our selves with a few drinks in the meantime.\n\nI don't know what boutique places like Craigie on Main or No. #9 Park go to to find their bartenders, but they are certainly a special sort (have you _seen_ their anachronistic and well-styled facial hair?). Delightful and masterful, always glib and entertaining; Craigies 'tender is no exception, fashionably or otherwise. \n\nAs for the food, I recall that we got the grilled Spanish octopus, pig's ear salad. Hiramasa sashimi, an arctic char entree, the Craigie burger, and bone marrow with crostini, and a couple slices of pie (the chocolate pie and the peanut butter pie).  I am probably leaving something out there, but that is certainly most of it.\n\nIt is hot and humid and I don't want to wax food, but needless to say everything was quite good.  The marrow is a particularly good deal, at 10 dollars it is easier and cheaper than doing it your self. The arctic char was one of the more forgettable dishes, wonderfully cooked, but...\n\nIt seems like the entrees aren't always the best option, and if you want a variety of food, the money is better spent on their side dishes.\n\nThe service was much improved, none of the odd over intensity and inconsistencies of my previous time.\n\nI will definitely be back to get the pig head, one of these months, now perhaps a little sooner rather than later. \n\nAll in all a good restaurant with some pretty exquisite food, not cheap but some items could certainly be more expensive (others, perhaps a little bit less), unlike any other eating experiences in the area.   This restaurant can fit a whole variety of experiences, from dates, to snacks with friends, and congratulation-style dinners with the family."]
['So the manager contacted me and was very nice. That makes up for the service on my previous visit and I will give the server the benefit of the doubt as just maybe a bad day. Everybody has them. The food was good and now my opinion of the service has changed and I am adding a star. Thanks for having good customer service reply. I like that and it should be complemented!']
["The food at Craigie is always good, but you'd better have a reservation! We went recently with a group of 6 to celebrate my wife's birthday. She wanted one of their amazing burgers, but we were sat in the main dining room and they don't serve the bar food there. Small sadness.\n\nMost of the table got the steak. It had a sauce that some felt was too sweet and others felt was perfect. It was unanimous, though, that the steak lacked a robust beefy flavor. Disappointment all around.\n\nI had the veal tenderloin and sweetbreads. I was a little nervous about the sweetbreads since I'm not big on organs and glands, but it was delicious. It had a springy yet soft texture and a very mild flavor that was complimented well by the sauce. The tenderloin was tasty but nothing really to write home about.\n\nWe also got a side of brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. Even if you don't like brussel sprouts, do yourself a favor and get these if they have them. The sprouts are halved and then browned in a pan with the fat giving them a rich, smoky flavor that was to die for.\n\nThe staff was friendly, attentive and quick. Craigie's always been a good bet for us when we want to have a special night out but don't want to spend a fortune."]
["I was here last Friday for my one year anniversary with Jacob. It was a nice experience overall, but I would say the food did not live up to the expectations (and prices). \n\nThe service was superb. Our waiter was very nice, and we were given a complementary cocktail for our anniversary! We ordered 4 appetizers and 1 entree. \n\nThe first app was the sashimi. The fish was good, very fresh. However, the avocado was brown. For a place that is all about the freshest produce, I was unimpressed.  The next was the lab ribs. Incredibly salty and fatty. There were 2 ribs, and actually the one Jacob took was good because it had more meat, but the bottom one I went for was only fat and salt. Don't worry though, because it got better. Our next two apps were yummy, although not perfect. The poached egg over oxtail pastrami was delicious! Fabulous flavors! The egg was very lightly poached/soupy, so there was little to no egg taste. I would prefer a more poached egg/sauce taste. The pasta with venison was delicious as well, I could have used more meat/mushrooms, but I'm a chunky sauce kind of person. The wheat taste of the pasta was overwhelming without more chunky sauce.  \n\nThe main course was lamb 3 ways. The neck was also very fatty and unappetizing. The tongue was actually fabulous, as weird as it looked in its curled up presentation. The breast was very good as well, very tender! I could have used a better side, the veggies looked like the stuff that comes out the frozen package, and tasted like butter. I would like more complex flavors for my veggies for fine dining. \n\nNow, the desserts were AMAZING. The sweet grits were to die for! Definitely the highlight of the meal. We also had the goat milk cheesecake, also yummy.  \n\nIn all, the food had its ups and downs, but for an over $200 bill, there really shouldn't be so many oversalted or all-fat cuts."]
["This was the best dining experience I've had in Boston so far.  We came here on a Sunday night for a six-course Chef's Whim tasting.  We started with an amuse bouche of squid noodles and crispy garlic and it only got better.  There was a crab salad dish, a seared scallop dish, faro pasta, hangar steak, ice cream and flan, even some macaroons which came with the check.  For $55 a person, dinner was a steal.  The only issue is you have to make a reservation for after 9 pm on a Sunday to get this offer, but it's totally worth it.  \n\nThe ambiance was classy without being snooty, the noise level was boisterous without being overwhelming, and the wait staff are courteous and attentive.  Amazing all around."]
['Amazing! Our favorite restaurant in Boston, our visit happened last year and was a memorable one, one that we still talk about these days.  Outstanding service and attention to detail without being overwhelming.\n\nBut make no mistake about it, the food is the star, incredible, a journey of flavors and the season.  Really wish there were six stars to truly reflect what we thought of our experience at Craigie.']
["Deeelish.  Service was outstanding, so was the food.  We had the pig's head, which, while wonderful, was so fatty and rich, that while I'd happily recommend it, I'd suggest that everything else you order be on the lighter side, or you'll feel like a rhinoceros when you leave.  Which means you wouldn't try the pig tails, which would be a shame, 'cause they were spectacular.  Drinks were all just wonderful.  Plus the pre fixe price at about $60 was pretty great, as the portions were quite generous.  Desserts were lovely but the chocolate one was by FAR the best, maybe even the best thing of the night.  It was huge, rich, deep...perfect!  I'll be back next time for the burger!  Thanks, Craigie!"]
["I am not sure that it gets much better than this- Craigie is an experience that we should all have at least once in our lives. (or once per month if your bank account can handle it) \n\nThe service is impeccable without the snobbery that you can run into at an establishment of this caliber. The waitstaff was friendly, knowledgeable, and more than happy to help with wine selections as we gorged ourselves on amazing food. \n\nThe meal was perhaps one of the best that I have ever had. Fresh meat, fresh vegetables, and interesting combinations. You can't be picky if you want to eat here as the menu is changed daily and based on what is available at market but my god you will not be disappointed!"]
['Okay, so to get right to the point.  Whereas some businesses don\'t seem to care what experience people have in their establishment, Craigie on Main really cares.  I mean *really* outstandingly, genuinely, fabulously, cares about your experience.  \n\nI had a sort of grumpy reaction to my first meal there, which we ate at the bar (though my partner later reminded me that he actually *had* really enjoyed his drink the first time around, the "northern lights").  The day after I posted it, I got an email from the owner of the restaurant, not just apologizing for the experience, but genuinely I would say concerned and distraught about what had happened, wanting to know the details.  She then, I kid you not, sent me a $100 gift certificate in the mail, a menu of their specialties, and a sweet invitation to come back and try it again.  I was shocked and delighted. \n\nIt took us a while to make it back to Craigie (and even longer to get to this review, which I feel awful about) as I\'ve been caught up this year with a series of insanely draining events (e.g. planning a wedding, moving to India, starting a new degree program that draws heavily on the math I never learned in high school), but we finally did.  \n\nI wish that I had documented at the time all the details of our absolutely blissful meal at Craigie, but I was just selfishly caught up in enjoying being treated like an absolute princess and was not thinking of you, fellow Yelpers.  Sorry! But the first and strongest thing I have to say, is that we got the absolute best service we\'ve ever gotten, ever, anywhere, that night at Craigie.  They treated us like royalty, but not in a stuffy or weird way, just in that absolutely effortless way that always characterizes the best service.  (and we weren\'t getting special treatment or anything, we didn\'t whip out our gift certificate until the end). \n\nThe food was also wonderful.  I got the vegetarian prix fixe and my husband got the meat prix fixe with the pork 3 ways.  We had wanted to try the tasting menu, which looks like the end-all be-all of delightfulness, but I have shellfish allergies, and there is a lot of seafood on that menu.  \n\nI wish I could give more detail on the food, but it\'s all become a white wine-fueled blur of exquisite sensations, topped off by a stunning, shockingly good homemade sorbet. \n\nIn all ways, including food, service, and genuinely caring, Craigie is genuinely world class.  If you can afford it, this is the most special special-occasion place I\'ve been to in the Boston area.  \n\nKudos to Craigie!  You\'re amazing.  We\'ll be back.  (Someday in a few years when we move home from India...)']
['I\'ve had the pigs head now.........twice.   There have been few piggy experiences in my life that have been so amazing and utterly satiated.  The menu has fantastic, the burger is one of the best in the nation other than that late night burger you make at home (or Tasty Burger).  \n\nOverall Craigie is a solid experience anytime........provided you can get a table.  Tony\'s attention to quality is famous and they source some of the best ingredients available.  Great place for a relaxed date or a business occasion, or the occasional "I want a pigs head for my birthday" excuse.']
["I'm glad I didn't judge this book by its cover.\n\nI went to Craigie while in Boston for work on K's recommendation. I arrive just a tad before my reservation (wasn't sure about the timing of the T). I don't have a problem waiting for my table if I'm early; however, Craigie's space is not conducive to early arrivers. I was told to wait on the ramp between the bar and the dining room, and someone would be able to get me a drink. So I waited. And waited. FINALLY, a manager (I'm guessing) asked if I had been helped. He was kind enough to take care of my thirst.\n\nAnd then dinner began. First, where can you top such a deal: $75 for any app, any entree, any dessert, AND a dessert wine paired with it?! AWESOME.\n\nI opted for the delectible yellowfin sashimi, the pork three ways, and the mango rhubarb crisp for dessert. The sashimi had excellent flavor, without losing the actual taste of the fish (which, IMHO, is why you choose to eat raw fish). The pork trio was RIDIC - the rib fell right off the bone, the belly was fatty and delicious, and the confit was as tender as it should be! Dessert reflected the turn of the season, highlighting the sweetneess of the rhubarb and champagne mangoes.\n\nI always wonder if the staff feels sorry for the solo diner. At Craigie, they didn't. They were extremely courteous, and allowed me to enjoy my meal without being overly intrusive. \n\nCraigie, thanks for what turned out to be my best dining experience in Boston..."]
['Expensive, great tasting menu and good service - try 6 /8 course meal']
['Let me start off by saying that I NEVER write reviews for restaurants. But I NEED to write one now. \nSO i just ate at Craigie tonight. I made reservations 4 months in advance for Valentine\'s Day weekend. This restaurant is rated as one of the BEST in the nation so I HAD to go of course. Never expected the restaurant to be located next to city projects but dont judge a book by its cover. So we walk in...great service and ambience. Our waiter was super nice at first and explained the eclectic menu well. I ordered the famous fried pig-tails...BIG MISTAKE, recommended by the waiter.\n\nAlthough I will say that my boyfriend\'s roommate that i will admit is older and wiser (as much as i hate to admit this) did tell me that I may deserve this as to eat anything that grows so close to a pigs but... is stupid.\n"It\'s a fracking pig\'s tail... here let me draw you a picture... here is the but hole, and here is what you ate at the fanciest restaurant in the country..."\nsome lessons must be learned and can\'t be taught....\n(don\'t get the pig\'s tail.... )\nyou are an idiot.\nSincerely,\nthe 38 year old roommate that took over writing this.\nI\'m sure it\'s great... if you don\'t order fracking appendages of pigs.\n\nANYWAYS! Back to me! So my boyfriend got the butternut squash soup which was fantastic. Dishes taken and soon the entrees arrived. I ordered the Halibut doused in some sort of cream sauce....BIG MISTAKE, also recommended by the waiter. And my boyfriend got the sirloin which was cooked to perfection! YUMMM.\nHonestly, my biggest complaint about the restaurant was the lack of attentiveness of the waiter after our appetizers were removed. He DID NOT once ask us how our entrees were. He DID NOT explain the dessert menu to us. He DID however conveniently show up at the end when we were about to give the tip and asked how the food was. I said it was "okay", he of course was taken aback. He did try to make the experience better by giving us cheap rose flavored marshmallows and sesame macaroons.\nConclusion: Overrated and expensive (185 dollars for the two of us), One time deal.']
["Long over due review.\n\n1st time:\nWent with 3 others.\nI believe I had poached sole, it was .... so... good.\nWe all kind of tried one another's food, everything was great.\nThe amuse bouche was spectacular, which is an understatement.\nWe had a reservation, but ended up waiting from anywhere to half and hour to an hour, but it was worth the wait.  If this happens to you, grab a drink, they are delicious also.  (Waitress ended up giving us some free dessert, which was nice of her and very tasty as well.)\n\n2nd time:\nParty and I opted for the tasting menu.\nThe food was good, but I found myself longing for my first experience, unfortunately.  However, I will not be deterred from going again.\n\n1st visit I'd give 6 stars if I could.\n2nd visit more like a 3.5.\n\nLasting impression of amazing 1st visit - 5 stars it is!"]
['Craigie is my favorite restaurant in Boston. What Chef Maws and his staff create will be something that you will never forget. Everything I have eaten there has been outstanding. I have been for Dinner, Brunch, and just dessert at the bar some night and I have never had a bad experience. The staff is always friendly and ready to serve. If you do not try Craigie you are surely missing out on something wonderful.']
["My boyfriend and I went to Craigie last week. We live in Boston, so we are aware of the restaurant's reputation. We were expecting a fabulous meal. Instead, we had a mediocre burger and an overpriced stuffed chicken dish that tasted like....salt. Our cocktails were good, but the entire meal plus tip came to $100. I fear that the restaurant is on a decline since the head chef Tony Maws left to cook at his new restaurant, Kirkland Tap and Trotter. I wonder if he has a capable replacement in the kitchen, but with their prices they certainly should. The prices paired with the quality of flavor left a bad taste in our mouths. We will not go back."]
['Dear Chef Tony Maws and Craigie on Main staff: \n\nI would like to thank you for the best dining experience of my foodie life. The service was impeccable. With each course (we did the six-course tasting menu), we were more excited to try the next:\n\n1. Three Chilled Seafood Preparations \n2. Nantucket Bay Scallop Sashimi\n3. Fried Maine Smelt\n4. Pekin Duck Noodles Two Ways\n5. Poached Egg Vegetable Salad\n6. Pork Three Ways\n\nEverything was uniquely superb from the cocktails (Ardoise) to the cozy, unpretentious decor. I offer you my unwavering praise. I was happy to pay the price for this opportunity as the quality, creativity and pork belly were second to none. What a treat. Kudos! \n\nSincerely, \nNikki B.']
["I've eaten here twice - once for the ultimate Chef's Tasting menu, and once for the Chef's Whim offered only on Sunday nights - so, funnily enough, I've never ordered off a Craigie's menu (excepting of course the wine list!). But I've been served close to 20 courses here, over a range of flavors and products, from trout to scallops to soft-shell crab, from pig's tails to sweetbreads to pork ribs, from palate-cleansing sorbets to beignets to chocolate tarts....and every single bite has been absolute perfection. My boyfriend and I eat everything, but we've also loved quite literally everything we've eaten here. Also, the service is stellar - I don't have a bad word to say about Craigie."]
['Dinner\n\nOne of my favorites in Boston. Super tasty and creative menu']
['An awesome experience. Visited Craigie while on a trip to Boston and opted for the "Chef\'s Whim" menu. What a great experience. There\'s something about not knowing what dish is next and knowing that you are in the chef\'s capable hands makes the experience that much better. The timing of the service was great (not rushed and not too slow) and the food was superb. The ingredients were fresh and top notch. For a tasting menu, I thought the portions were also generous. I opted for the 6 course and it was well worth the upgrade. Everything - from service to food - made this a great experience. This has to be among the best restaurants in Boston - take advantage of the Chef\'s Whim while the prices stay relatively low.\n\nAlso, a little something about the restaurant -- it does get a little warm since there is an open kitchen but I found it had a great atmosphere. The room was airy but there was still some intimacy within the tables.']
["Wow. I searched for several days on Yelp and Google combing through about 40-50 restaurant options with Valentine menus for myself and partner. In all my searching their were only two other restaurants I found that were more expensive than Cragie on Main but Cragie on Main had the best reviews I've ever seen so I choose that. I reserved a 9pm low top table and it was a beautiful corner booth. I think literarily the best seat in the house. We parked on the street and arrived 10 minutes early. The checkin woman seemed a bit overwhelmed with constant phone calls while also managing checkins. My only recommendation is that on holidays they might need one person dedicated to just phone calls. We sat down and ordered a cocktail and our waiter enthusiastically greeted us. He discussed the wine pairing menu to compliment our 5 course meal. I wasn't planning on it but we decided to try it for a change. The waiter didn't pressure us at all which was great. Each course was simply amazing and full of several flavors. There wasn't a single food item we didn't like. My only regret was getting the wine tasting as while I imagine any wine fans would love it, we would have been quite fine without it. Mostly, because we talked with each other all dinner so we were drinking very slowly and got back logged on glasses of wine. The night seemed to fly by, but I think that's because we were having such a great time as we realized we had actually been there for just over 3 hours after looking at the clock. The only real downside is the cost. At 300 for two people, plus 100 for wine tasting, plus 2 cocktails, plus 20% tip you can see how it adds up to potentially your most expensive dinner you may ever have. I can't take any stars off for that however as they are upfront on all their costs, and the food could not be any fresher or tastier nor the staff any nicer. So you get what you pay for and I recommend everyone visit here at least once in your life. Amazing!"]
['My husband I had dinner at Craigie on Main last month for our anniversary and had a great experience. We got the 8 course Ultimate Craigie Experience tasting menu which was was delicious! The drinks were very good and the service was excellent. I wanted to get the cocktail flight but you can only get it in the bar area, so if you want that make sure to get it before you head to your table or eat in the bar.\n\nChef Maws was fun to watch in the kitchen. He seemed to get along well with his staff, although they all seemed much more relaxed when he was not around. hehe! He brought out our entrees which was exciting and a nice touch that I appreciated and enjoyed. I love when restaurants do that. I think it adds a personal touch when the chef/owner interacts with the customers and it makes it seem like they are proud of their food.\n\nMy only complaint is that the vegetarian tasting menu did not leave me satisfied. I do not think I have ever left any restaurant still hungry before. I rarely finish meals so this was disappointing to me. The entree seemed more like a side than a meal.\n\nIt has been over a month since we dined here, so I will  just highlight some of the courses that I remember.\n\nThe trio to start was very interesting. Each of the bites was simply delicious! The potato tempura was something I had never had and was my favorite bite. The 2nd course was an avocado salad for me and a tartar with avocado salad for the husband. I like that they had the same flavors so we could discuss it. I have never enjoyed avocado quite so much!\n\nI had a consume with tempura squash flowers that was so good! The server said it was something that Chef Maws had never made before and I told him that it is something that he should add to the menu. It was light but so satisfying and perfect. \n\nThe gnocchi were my favorite part of the meal. They were cooked perfectly and had a wonderful texture. I wish they came in a slightly larger portion and were the main entree. The main entree was a grain pilaf with some root vegetables. I kept looking over at my husbands lamb with jealousy. I did not understand how my entree that looked like it should have been a side dish could have been served next to my husbands entree. As I said above, this was the only disappointing experience of the evening. It is unfortunate that it happened with my main entree.\n\nThey also had a mistake with our desserts. They mixed them up and gave me my husbands panna cotta which is normally made with geletan and not vegetarian. I asked about it when it was served. The waiter whisked it away and took it back to the kitchen to ask. He brought back the deserts and switched them so my husband had the panna cotta.\n\nWe both had a wonderful evening. I wish that we lived closer so we could become regulars. I would love to try the Sunday night whim. It sounds like a lot of fun! Considering how much I loved the consume that Chef Maws made on a whim the night we dined there, I would love to do the full course whims. I am sure my husband and I will be back to Craigie soon! Next time I want to sit in the bar so I can try the whim and my husband would like to try the burger which has gotten rave reviews and is on many "best burger in Boston" lists.']
['Fabulous food served in a very serious atmosphere with a slight Oliver Twist attitude when it came to the bread &amp; butter...\n\nMy date and I had the 6 course prix fixe meal and every course was done perfectly!!\n\nThe food was hot, well prepared, and tasted delicious!!\n\nI loved the bread they served and the great butter.  And since each course (they are small plates, like tapa size) takes a while to get to you the bread &amp; butter was helpful to have &amp; fills you up.\n\nThe only problem, I didn\'t like that we had to keep asking them for more bread (since their wait staff was so attentive, like 3 to a table!!...it was odd that they would not just re-fill the basket--I ended up feeling as if I was being too greedy or something...) "may I have more bread sir, please?"  \n\nAlso, they serve only about a tablespoon and a half of butter on a plate for like 6 large pieces of bread, what??!  So we had to keep asking them for more butter too...sigh\n\nThe wine they suggested was superb.\nAnd I like that they offer both sparkling and non-sparkling water :)\n\nSo my date &amp; I LOVE good food &amp; wine and were enjoying ourselves.  But each time we would laugh out loud it was like the whole place stopped to glare at us.  \n\nWe weren\'t being obnoxious just having a fun time, but the GRAVITY of the place was slightly a downer.  The wait staff were not very friendly either.  So I can\'t tell if it was pretentiousness because their food is so good or just an intensity to get everything right.']
["Once again, a superb dining experience -- again, we had Sarah, the amazing server who waited on us last time (And, Sarah -- we under-tipped by mistake -- didn't realize til we got home -- but we'll make it up to you next time!) -- and we FINALLY got our burgers in the bar.  Chef Tony and his wife just run a fabulous restaurant -- fascinating to also watch Chef the Maestro running his kitchen.\n\nMy kids gave us a gift certificate -- they knew we loved it there.\n\nNot cheap -- but worth every penny. Can't wait to do it again. (Hint, hint, kids!!)"]
['I had a simple dinner at the bar and got to see the talented bartender work his magic.  The food was really flavorful and "just right" in both size, presentation, freshness and taste.  I was surprised how expensive the restaurant is - its up there with the priciest in the city - but ultimately it was worth it considering the results.  Staff was very nice.']
["One of the best meals I've ever had and, by far, the best I've had in recent memory.\n\nExtremely high quality food, excellent service and relatively inexpensive for the quality.  I've never been into the food that looks more like art than a meal but these guys pull it off.\n\nWe had to wait over an hour for a seat at the bar but that's our fault for going on a Saturday night with no reservations.  They made every attempt to compensate us by serving us drinks while we were standing in line and constantly coming over to check on us.  \n\nWe sat at the bar and had our option of the bar menu or the dining room menu. The bartender was extremely nice, informative and friendly.  She recommended different beers with the meal and came off as knowledgeable without being snobby or condescending.  \n\nThe first few things I noticed about the menu is all the food they get is ordered fresh and locally. Most of the meats and cheeses come from farms in Vermont or MA and the menu is printed nightly...even time stamped.\n\nI ended up getting the Vermont Organic Pork Three Ways: Crispy Suckling Confit, Spice-Crusted Rib, Grilled Belly.  A meal I cannot even imagine eating...never mind ordering....a few years ago. The portions always look so small but by time you eat the bread, an app and have a few beers...it's plenty of food."]
["My biggest complaint: I went on Sept 13. One of Craige on Main's desserts had been featured in the Sept 30, 2014 Wine Spectator. The magazine had JUST been published. When we asked about the dessert, we were told that management took it off their menu about 2 weeks earlier. It would have been logical for management to offer the dessert for a few weeks after the publish date, no? We went to Toscanini for dessert."]
['Impressive!\n\nI have hearded about Craigie On Main for a long time and it was so hard to get a reservation since we always go out with a bunch of people so we would need large tables. I made my reservation 2 weeks ahead this time just for 2 of us.\n\nDecor - modern bistro\nopen kitchen, close seating. some people are dressed up but I still felt relaxing and comfortable. \n\nFood - you have to try this!\nThere are so much creative food on the menu. seasonal and organic ingredients were used. We had pate, bone marrow as appertizers, chicken sausage and veals two ways as entrees, and shared the pecan ice cream tart as dessert. They were all amazing! I loved my veals! one part was super tender and juice, and the other part was baked to perfection with crispy skin and lean meat full of flavor. The hubby was crazy about his bone marrow and ate way too much toasts because of it. (he is usually very picky and I can barely hear him make compliments to any food.)\n\nService - perfect\nwe had to catch a movie afterwards so we told our server during our second course. he then paid more attention to us and brought our dessert quickly and got us the bill so we were on time. the bus boy, the hostess and our waiter were all very friendly and helpful throughout the night!\n\nBest restaurant in Boston! (not too pricy either!)']
['For my 500th review (omg), I will sing the praises of our Valentine\'s dinner at Craigie on Main!\n\nWe decided to go the day after V-day so that we could get the $75/person prix-fixe menu (instead of the $150 menu on the 14th!). Each course offered two options, so we decided to just order ALL of it! I\'m no restaurant reviewer, so please excuse my limited adjectives.\n\nFirst course: amuse bouche\n- The crab was really fresh, and it was surprising to taste crab this good in the NE. (I\'m from Maryland. Blue crabs are the best!)\n- The teeny slivers of pork belly with fresh mozzarella was delicious. The little splash of balsamic vinegar was a nice touch.\n\nSecond course: appetizer\n- His mushroom ragout was out of this world. We were intrigued by this gelatinous form in the middle of his plate, and we discovered it was a poached egg! Yum! This dish was creamy, rich and delicious.\n- My sashimi was perfection. There were so many different textures and unexpected that went really well together! Our appetizers were definitely the highlight of our meal.\n\nThird course: entree\n- His scallops were good, but not great. There isn\'t much you can do to scallops. They\'re either good or bad.\n- My lamb three ways was really delicious. My favorite among the loin, lamb heart sausage and lamb confit was the confit.\n\nFourth course: dessert\n- His mixed fruit dessert was amazing. It sounded pretty plain on the menu, but this is a very special dessert. The canela ice cream really topped it off - such a unique flavor! \n- My gingerbread pain perdu was soooo gingery. Beware - this dessert is for ginger LOVERS only. The poached cranberries were too tart to eat, even with the other elements of the dessert. \n- A complimentary dessert wine was included in our prix-fixe, and ohhhh, I love dessert wines!!! \n- A Taza hot chocolate with cardamom and other spices was also complimentary, and I\'ve decided that I don\'t really like cardamom. But it was free, so we slurped it up!\n\nSo, the best part about our meal was definitely the appetizers, but I also have to mention the service. Our server was awesome. He really made us feel welcome--even appreciated! He was friendly, pleasant, calm, professional, efficient, and available. \n\nI have to conclude this review by making a little comparison. Our other mind-blowing Valentine\'s Day dinner was at Ten Tables JP last year... and I have to say that I prefer TT over Craigie. Every single course and element of our Ten Tables dinner was completely unforgettable. Nothing about it was so-so or just good. But I\'m still giving Craigie on Main five stars because I do think it was pretty much as good as it gets.\n\nOh! One tip about attire. Yelpers have categorized the attire as "dressy," but be aware that the servers themselves wear dark jeans. I\'d say it\'s more on the casual side. No ties or jackets necessary.  \n\nTHE END!']
["I have been here three times, tried vegetarian tasting menu and regular tasting menu, i can only say it is good, but not outstanding, didn't give me any surprise...."]
['This is an excellent restaurant - and you pay for it.  I had the six course tasting menu although they ended up giving us eight courses.  They had several versions of the tasking menu - vegetarian, pescatarian, no-fish, no-red meat, and everything - and asked us if there was anything beyond that we would prefer not to try.\n\nEach course was interesting and tasty.  The sashimi tuna and rabbit pasta were my favorites.  They also have a great wine list, but the beer list is a bit limited.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the food and wine.  They worked well together as well.  This is definitely a great restaurant for a special occasion or great meal.']
["We stumbled onto Craigie on Main years ago.  The original location was in Harvard Square where it was called Craigie Street Bistro.  Brian's parents were in town, so we figured we'd give it a try having heard so many great things about it.  We were so glad we did...it was a fabulous meal!  Ever since then, we've gone to the new location at a dozen times in the past 2 years.  Once for my birthday, and then for the rehearsal dinner.  We couldn't have imagined a more perfect venue.  Betsy, the private events coordinator, was nothing but professional &amp; sincere about making our event as perfect as possible.  \n\nWe met Betsy about 3 weeks before the RD to go over the menu and I had no doubt in my mind that everything would be perfect.  She made sure of it.  The only negative thing I have to say is that she spelled my name wrong on our personalized menus, but small beans.  I can't wait to go back soon &amp; get the pork again!  Guests are still raving about our amazing gastronomic wedding held at Radius...Craigie played an integral part in kicking off the festivities with an oustanding RD!\n\nFor all the foodies out there, here is the menu.  Guests were allowed to select from the following:\nAppetizers:\n\nPotage of Sorrel &amp; Potato - with pork jowl croutons &amp; paprika oil\nAssiette of Kona Kompachi Sashimi - with red onion shiso salsa, avocado, harissa-rose vinaigrette\nQuattre Foies of Vermont organic pork - served with traditional accompaniments\nFresh Maine Mussels - toasted garlic, chile caribe, miso and herbs\n\nMain:\nOrganic Chicken Three Ways - slow roasted breast, thigh confit, braised wing - schmaltz-braised vegetables, aged balsamic vinegar and bagna cauda\nOrganic Pork Two Ways - crispy suckling confit, grilled belly - chantarelle mushrooms, early summer vegetables, spring peas\nSlow Roasted Line Caught Halibut - mussel and leek ragout, grilled lemon and butter herb salad, oyster sake lees sauce\nVermont Organic Lam Two ways - hon shimeji mushrooms, cashews, blood orange, cognac\n\nDessert:\nHouse made profiteroles with valrhona chocolate sauce - calaminthe ice cream\nMarket fruits crisp - walnut topping, tarragon ice cream\nCornbread pain perdu - candied fennel, red plum puree, anise hyssop ice cream\nThree fruits sorbet - with candied kumquat, limequat, mandarin"]
["I'm going to Miami for a while, where the only quality food I'll be having will probably be Cuban...so to top off my Boston area culinary experience, I finally listened to everyone and went to Craigie on Maine. I have to say this is probably another redundant review, because yes, this place is all the...216 other reviews are raving about.  Fresh, quality ingredients, creative flavor combinations, SMALL portions. Although I would never expect to get Chinese-restaurant sized plates from a gourmet place, in this case the deliciousness of the dishes was actually a detriment to my rating: it was so good that I felt in constant dissatisfaction as I ate and realized each dish was gone in 5 seconds.\n\nBut anyway\nGO TO CRAIGIE ON MAINE\nGET THE PIG TAILS\nGET THE CRISPY BERRY TART (orgasmic)\n\nYou can also try making a reservation at peak dinner time (like I did), arrive on time, wait for 25 minutes until a table is cleared, and subsequently get free delicious special chef dishes and drinks throughout the rest of your meal experience that will certainly return a smile to your face, yay for overbooking! (and EXCELLENT SERVICE)"]
["One word: OINK or two words: Pig  Night. It was awesome, the best meal by far from start to finish and all connected by this amazing animal. Least you think it was all meat - noooo, seafood and pasta and all else but it all had some perfect porcine nods. And the wine pairing - perfect.\nLooking forward to next year's pig night. Oh, and by the way, I don't even bother anymore with another restaurant when I want to splurge. This place is so consistent every time."]
["This is an INCREDIBLE restaurant.  Can't say enough about the service, food, ambiance etc.  However, the purpose of my visit to Craigie on Main was to experience one of the so-called best burgers of Boston.  Without further ado, here is my review of their burger, in direct comparison to my benchmark burger at Sel de la Terre:\n\nMEAT: a win!  Craigie's patty was both thicker AND juicier than Sel de la Terre's - a most commendable feat.  \n\nBUN: a loss.  The bun at Craigie is good...but it's still not the same as the crispy brioche I've come to love at SDLT.\n\nTOPPINGS: another loss.  SDLT has some sort of heavenly aioli that pairs so well with ground beef you'd think they were made for each other.  Craigie has a more traditional ketchup-y sauce that is good, but no where close to the aioli-crack that SDLT uses.\n\nFRIES: Both restaurants serve shoe-string fries, but Craigie's are what I would describe as dental-floss fries.  They are crispy, plentiful, and spiced with cayenne or something.  SDLT has fantastic rosemary fries that are also plentiful and crispy, but have a higher potato to fried ratio.  Win goes to SDLT.\n\nSo...I would say overall, Craigie lost the burger contest.  That being said, if I were to crave anything else, Craigie would certainly win over SDLT."]
["Trusting Justin C.'s recommendation (Thank you), we reserved a table for Saturday night when we arrived in Boston. This was one of my two most favorite part of the weekend Boston trip. I indulged in this 10-course Chef Tasting experience. Though it was $115 per person, the portion was very generous well worth every cent compared to a lot overrated places in DC. I was also offered the chef's kitchen table where the entire food preparation took place in front of our eyes. I was very impressed by all the chefs, diligently working away in the most organized fashion - I think this is also why Craigie is successful. The kichen was immaculate and the chefs all had their station prepared and kept clean at all times. From kitchen to floor - all the staffs' attention was on serving the food hot!  Head chef Tony Maws even chased after waiters when they were not ready when the food was ready. Now that's something to note for!\n\nOur waiter -  he was very enthusiastic about recommending wine and all kinds of stuff to us. He was also very nice about letting us substitute any a-la-carte items if we wanted to try them. He also printed us two copies of the 10-course menu - now that's great service! We didn't need to ask for too much - it's a wonderful restaurant with a 'giving' attitude. The wine list was mostly french and I was just in heaven with it but my friend wasn't so sure. We were a bit apprehensive about the choice of wine but I ended up picking the 1999 Bandol Domaine du Gros Noré  which the waiter recommended over and over. It's Mourvèdre, Syrah, Cinsault, Grenache - you can't go wrong with that! It had to open up hence it needed decanting - it was a very fine wine with a nice tannin yet balanced. I liked it alot.\n\nSeafood trio of fish liver, squid noodles w/ nuoc cham and fried shrimp. I read that the nuoc cham is made in-house, together with the squid, it was very complex yet delicious dish. That was my fav of the trio. \n\nSalad of hiramasa sashimi w/ red onion-shiso salsa, avocado, &amp; harissa-rose vinaigrette: The sashimi was great but I thought the cumin in the harissa was slightly overpowering even though it tasted fresh toasted. Slightly less cumin would be better. My friend made a comment to the waiter and the chefs probably heard it but I hope they took it constructively.\n\nWaloo with Yuzu - The fish was so fresh yet sweet and fatty resulting in this creamy taste with the yuzu sauce which was incredible. We both nodded our heads for this one.\n\nRed chile &amp; sesame marinated Faroe Island Sea Trout Kama (the collar, Maws calls it shoulder) - with higher gelatin level near the cartilage, it's like Chef Maws understands why the asians love fish that are not detached from the cartilage, it's priced for the gelatinous layer that provided the fish flavor and tenderness. It's smooth and melts in your mouth. The fish swam in a red sauce made from red chile and sesame. I hope I am wrong on this but the sauce if mixed with something from ready made from a jar which gave it the extra saltiness. The sauce was velvety and aromatic but just a tad too salty for me hence it's off balance. The fish however was cooked to perfection. I still give this dish a 5 star for the chef Maws' adventure with experimenting with something most chain-restaurants-overcooked-flavorless-fish-fillet type fans would freak out about.\n\nPork heart sausage ragu, uni and fresh pasta - I know I like the dish below but this is my favorite dish of the night - Hands down. I gasped for a second when they told me what was served the sound of pork heart didnt resonate well for me because I am not a big fan of organ meat. Untill recently I started loving foie gras and sweetbread but pork heart!! I didnt let my fear get the best of me so I just sank my fork into this amazing ragu. The pork heart sausage was well spiced and cooked till very tender in the sauce. Then I combined it with the uni. The flavor of this dish worked wonderfully, more than I expected. I think Chef Maws is a genius at this point. It was simply an amazing dish. I wonder if my palate has matured or it's just simply organ meat made simpler\n\nVeal Sweetbread, blood sausage, egg, farro - absolutely amazing bursting with such complex flavors. This dish had me going on a tasting galore I was speechless - First three gave it such a complex flavor and I absolutely love the farro absorbing all the flavors. Loved it!\n\nLamb trio - lamb tenderloin, lamb sausage and lamb belly - I heart the lamb belly in this dish, belly is becoming a popular part but the lamb belly was a nice touch.\n\nWe also ordered the bone marrow which seemed like the hot ticket item, the prep chef who toasted fresh bread that accompanied the marrow had the alarm clock going off practically the entire night.\n\nJasmine tea infused panna cotta w/ candied citrus zest\n\nPeanut Butter Ice Cream,  Banana mousse\n\nAncho chile &amp; cardamom spiced Valrhona hot chocolate\n\n3 Desserts were great but too much food at the en"]
['I received a very kind, thoughtful email from Craigie on Main after my previous review.  They apologized for our experience and asked for a chance to do it right.  I appreciated their efforts and finally got around to trying again.  We had a delicious meal with very attentive staff.  We had the tasting menu again and I would say that 70% of it was bang for buck and the service made up for the 30% that was just average.  Turns out they are/were having a problem with their coffee provider.  I am not the only client who found the espresso rancid so its good to know they are working on it.']
['So this review is a little different and related to the one star reviewer from the other day.  I went there with my last night intending on getting the Valentine\'s Day prix fixe menu, but because my date was getting over being sick, we ordered off the a la carte menu instead.\n\nEverything was typical Craigie excellence - wine suggestions, great table, the desire to order EVERYTHING off the menu.  I went with the rabbit and sausage lasagnette and the hangar steak and Laura went with the cod cheeks app and organic chicken entree and we split the Tazo chocolate/espresso tart for desert.\n\nSo the hangar steak comes out, looks amazing, but actually tastes a little off.  I take another bite and offer some to Laura - we both agree it is ok, but not amazing, maybe too much vinegar.  I am basically freaking now, because this is our favorite fancy restaurant and i am about to send back my steak.  \n\nI call the waiter over and tell him it tastes a little off.  He didn\'t respond with the "why?" or make me feel like it was my fault at all!  It was all about what can we do to fix this? new entree? another glass of wine? have the chef taste it?  I apologized profusely for not liking it, but they are BEYOND GRACIOUS and wanted to make sure that we didnt just like our entrees, but LOVED them.  I ordered something else which emerged quickly and we enjoyed a great rest of the meal.\n\nThe moral of this story is that if you dont like it - tell them!  The one star reviewer who hated her veggie valentine\'s day didn\'t say anything until the end of the meal!  Let them know and trust me they will take care of you.  I was pretty embarrassed to send back my steak, but I have to say that because of the service we received, we would 1000% absolutely go back.']
['Having gone to Craigie Street Bistro a few years back and learning that Chef Tony Maws recently won the James Beard award, I came in to this meal with really high expectations.  I left simply blown away in every way and consider this arguably the best meal of my life.  The food was simply amazing.  Knock you off your chair amazing.\n\nAmuse Bouche: squid noodles - absolutely delicious with the toasted garlic on top being a standout component.  I randomly asked a server, who wasn\'t even our ours, how they prepared this dish and he listed the entire culinary process, step-by-step.  So impressive.\n\nAppetizer: ragout with mushrooms, morcilla (Spanish blood sausage) and pig - an unbelievable mixture of flavors, textures and colors.  The blood sausage was rich, complex and simply delicious.  The most beautiful plate of the meal.\n\nEntree: pork three ways - simply stated, this was one of the top three entrees I\'ve ever had in a restaurant anywhere.  All three preparations (rib, belly and confit) were mind blowingly awesome.  They literally couldn\'t have tasted any better.  The vegetables on this plate were wonderful as well.\n\nDessert: panna cotta with granola and brown butter "powder" - light, delicious and unique.  The granola was flavored with lavender.  The brown butter "powder" disappeared on your tongue instantly and then left a brown butter flavor afterwards.  Very unique and well executed use of molecular gastronomy.\n\nThe macaroons served with the check were delicious as well.\n\nService: perfect in every way.  Friendly, not intrusive and most of all, knowledgable.  Very, very knowledgable.  Such a wonderful thing to experience when you go out for fine dining.\n\nOur table was a high top for four that basically overlooked the open kitchen.  Probably about 10 feet away or so.  Sitting at this table and watching Chef Maws and his team work was fascinating and inspirational.  It added to the dining experience in ways we weren\'t expecting when we sat down.  I plan to specifically request this table again when I return to this restaurant.  Watching this team work during our meal was breathtaking.\n\nOther items I tried throughout the night were the vegetable amuse bouche, pig\'s tail appetizer, charcuterie appetizer, bone marrow appetizer, chicken entree, steak entree, oxtail pastrami side, galette dessert, bread/butter and espresso.  Everything I tasted was great.  The pig\'s tail appetizer was ridiculously delicious.  Like eating the greatest Chinese food you could ever fathom.\n\nI cannot wait to return to this restaurant and experience the food, service and ambience again.  Chef Maws and his team have created a dining experience that is second to none in Boston/Cambridge and as good as any place I have eaten in the U.S. or Europe.  Congratulations!']
['The food was very good, nearly uniformly.  The prices were high, uniformly.  The pork 3-ways was really good.  the pig tails were good, but not curly enough.  The wine was as advertised, and exceptional, but not as wanted. \n\nBut, they made me laugh.  They are playing the Michelen guide star system style dining price and style.  A busser or assistant waiter (we don\'t know, they did not introduce themselves) made about 8 mistakes in about 10 seconds:\n   [Eating bread on a paper table cloth overtop of cloth tablecloth at end of meal]\n   "would you like a plate for your bread"\n   "no, thanks"\n   "Are you sure?"  with slight tone\n   "yes, I\'m sure"\n  later scraps crumbs with nice, French tool\n\n1.  you don\'t need a plate to eat bread at a bistro, you use a table cloth, no butter was involved \n1b.  no butter provided at that point\n1c  did not offer butter for bread at that time\n2.  if you want to offer a plate, then have a plate to hand\n3.  paper table cloth noticed as being on top of cloth\n4.  did not offer more bread\n5.  [reminded, we had to ask for bread in first place]\n6. asking customer twice\n7.  someone took plate away\n8.  and did not replace it\n9.  miscommunication between busboy and this person about replacing plates\n10.  ostentatiously removing crumbs with scraper 5 min later\n\nthey also amused as as servers, they looked like busboys, trying to deliver food to tables they were not sure of.  they would stride off confidently, then lose their way, then get stuck in the tight tables, and eventually plop it down.  \n\nso, 4 stars for failing to meet their own standards, being fussy, and over selling the wine (which made the sale, but cost the yelp comment)']
["I'm sure by now you don't need me telling you how amazing this restaurant is. Craigie is really one of the best restaurants I've been to. I've been there a couple of times for brunch and everything was absolutely delicious! The staff there are simply the best. They will answer any and all questions you have, make excellent recommendations, and are extremely attentive even when it is really busy, which mostly it is. I haven't thought of writing a review since this place already has such awesome reviews, but my experience during restaurant week this year prompted me to leave this review anyway. \n\nI'm not going to go into how amazing the food it here (Pig Tails, OMG), but what really stood out to me this time was the service that was provided by our waiter. I think the success of a restaurant is not just the quality of the food, but often more importantly the quality of the service. If you don't serve fine cuisine, then you should at least provide good service. Craigie accomplishes both. Our waiter was super nice, attentive, and extremely knowledgable about the dinner and wine menu. He made excellent suggestions. He recommended the corn grits for desert. It was my first time trying corn grits, and I realized corn grits weren't my thing. I felt bad for not finishing it, so I told our waiter I was really full already. When we got our bill, he had taken off the corn grits. He told me he noticed that I didn't eat much of it. I was really impressed. He could've let it go, and it really wouldn't have changed my opinion of this restaurant, but he made the extra effort to make me feel like he cared about his customers. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who lives in or is visiting Boston. I promise you, you will not be disappointed!"]
["Considering I'm on a college student who has a part time job, and works at an internship for 40+hrs a week for free budget,  it was pretty nice to be able to enjoy a nice meal at a fancy ass place like this. My friend and I weren't really aware of how expensive this place was/what the menu was all about, and our kind waiter helped us out/walked through the menu with us. For a bit I felt like my waiter was a saleswoman for food, and I felt a little guilty about turning down her exotic food suggestions. We ended up getting a burger (not mentioned on the menu), with fries and salad. The burger was huge, cooked medium rare, and filled me up. The salad, and the fries were also wicked good. My friend got the bone marrow, and he was talking about how delicious it was hours afterwards. I really enjoyed the waiters being friendly, laid back, and not intimidating. If you're interested in fine dining for the first time, have a laid back personality, and want to explore some exotic food choices then you should definitely check this place out."]
["I didn't want to like it as much as i do. I hate hype, and pretentious trust-fund kiddies who think spending money equates to taste, but this, friends, is no Deuxave. \n\nUber-competent FOH staff, warm, dark, but clean interior, a sincere devotion to quality, and food that was perfectly seasoned from amuse to lagniappe.\n\nI love finding fault with things, but really, there was very little here with which to quibble. And extra thanks to Chef Maws for his unexpected, generous,  and over-the-top hospitality."]
["My friend and I shared an appetizer and dessert, and we each ordered a entree, in the end the dinner cost each of us around 60 bucks. This is a lovely restaurant, service good, and good ambiance, but I just think that the good was good but not great, and didn't really worth that money. I'll give it five stars if the bill was 30-40. Service was really nice though, we commented on the chocolate dessert to our server that it had too much acidity in taste, and later she brought us a complimentary mini dessert as compensation."]
["I wish I foresaw ordering an appetizer, an entree and then an appetizer, and I totally would have gone for the discounted Price Fixe, but I underestimated the power of COM to over power my taste buds to that extent.\n\nStarted with the Spanish Octopus appetizer.  I've never eaten octopus, but the tenderness has vaulted it toward the top of my seafood pecking order.\n\nI then had the chicken sausage stuffed chicken (Yes, chicken stuffed with cheicken - brilliant), and my girlfriend had the Serloin.  Both were solid choices.\n\nI was set with the chicken filled with chicken.  Really, I was.  And then I was given the choices for dessert, and my will power took a vacation all the way to Pecan-piesville, population me.\n\nYou get what you pay for."]
["Living in a small beach town we look for superior dining experiences when we travel and Craigie on Main had the creds.  We were able to reserve a table for 4 in the bar and arrived early for our 8:30 reservation.  We of course had to wait and we were all so grateful to be shown a place to stand and be out of the way while we waited.  We were served drinks and proceeded to get caught up with our friends.  As 8:30 came and went we didn't fret, it's busy on a Friday evening, the apologies came from both our bar server and the hostess, finally we were seated at 9, really no problem.  We were promptly given menus and chose a bottle of wine.  The marble chiller was placed on the table, the amuse bouche was served and then we sat and sat and sat when finally our bar server caught my husbands eye and saw the situation, he got our waitress and she finally came over to bring the bottle we had ordered, opened the wine and took our orders,each of us getting the 3 course prix fixe. \n\n The first course came out in a reasonable time, my husband had the sashimi, very good.  I had the Spanish octopus...ehh. And our friends had a beautiful  chick pea soup, delicious.\n\nNext our entrees, slow cooked salmon with crab, the best entree by far.  I struck out with the pork 3 ways.  The ribs were salty and though pork belly is always yummy, I've had better.  Our friends had a steak, well cooked yet not really great he didn't enjoy it, the double stuffed chicken was espoused to be just delicious.  Yeah, then we had that little problem again...we were out of wine, and our dirty dishes sat on the table for a very very long time.  My husband was finally able to flag down the waitress and actually had to ask to have them removed.  \n\nWe all had our final course and all the desserts were delicious.  Home made sorbets, almond tart all so good.  Again we sat and sat.\n\nFinally we got a hold of the waitress and told her we needed to leave soon because I had to work early the next morning.  Got our bill...wow...and we waited and waited for her to come back.  When she came, we again said we had to leave and asked about getting our coats.  She said she'd take the tickets and have them out front for us...needless to say they were not there.  She 'forgot'.\n\nI must say that at that point in the night, 12:20AM (yes, 3 hours and 20 minutes later) our bar server was at the front desk, he immediately saw what was going on and got our coats for us.  We didn't complain but the mood was glum and he realized the situation, I would have loved to hear the conversation that ensued after we left.\n\nI've never eaten in a restaurant of this caliber and had such poor service.  I don't want that stuffy white glove clang of the cloche, just a friendly comfortable and yes attentive person bringing these delights.  I'm sorry but you should never have to call the wait staff to your table in this type of restaurant, it really ruins the experience and as I read my review I admit that it sours the taste of the food!\n\nI really wanted to have a great meal, we were all so looking forward to it but the next time I go out in Boston and spend that kind of money I'll go to 9 Park.  The food and the service there is impeccable, Craigie on Main could learn a lot from the team at 9 Park."]
["best valentine's meal that ever happened.\nseriously never wanted to bottle my saliva to use later as a sauce before. eyes involuntarily dropping shut in order to savor each bite as much as humanly possible. craigie on main. we made friends with one of the waiters (Jonathon) at another foodie convention and he recommended the place. he hooked it up with a free round of drinks and also brought us a tasting of a new drink they're adding to the menu. also, it is ranked second in the nation in GQ. amazing.\n\nfirst: amuse bouche - oyster tempura on squid ink, grey mullet crudo, rillettes of arctic char: the oyster tempura was the perfect bite, salty with a hint of sweet. the crudo was a little salty for my taste, actually overpoweringly so. the rilletes were delicious, the perfect texture and smoothness.\n\nsecond: hiramasa sashimi, w/ red onion-shiso salsa, avocado, harissa- rose vinaigrette\n&amp; foie gras au torchon with blood orange marmalade, brioche toast (i was a little bit appalled by the idea of foie gras but the waitress assured me they came from happy free range fowl. and it was amazing.) the foie was rich, creamy, well seasoned.. everything you could ask for. \n\nthird: house-made rabbit and guanciale sausage lasagnette w/ celery root puree, natural jus\n&amp; native lobster ravioli w/ kohlrabi puree, herbs: the ravioli was good, but not amazing. had better at Pazzo on Newbury. definitely still delicious though!\n\nfourth: sika venison two ways: three pepper-crusted leg, grilled crepinette with braised red cabbage, creamy puree of potato and whole grain mustard: this was seriously the must eat dish of my evening. my eyelids dropped of their own accord upon the first taste. perfectly prepared, the crepinette was fatty but it was the melt in your mouth kind of ambrosial fat not chewy at all. everything pared perfectly together, i was hard pressed not to lick my plate.\n&amp; elysian fields lamb three ways: roasted loin, shoulder confit, heart sausage with artichokes, beets, dates and olives\n\nfifth: blood orange sorbet: good tang, blood oranges are my fave so this was a great transition.\n\nsixth: chocolate tasting. homemade smores, macarons, bourbon chocolate creme, chocolate napoleon, and chocolate dipping sauce. - okay. i know i'm a chick and chicks &amp; chocolate yadda yadda whatever. i don't like chocolate.i don't particularly care for sweets in general. but i was blown away by not only the presentation but also the options on this plate.\ni could have drank the milk chocolate dipping sauce. there were two brioche-esque crueller things on the plate too that were lightly dusted with cinnamon sugar and they were phenomenal. \n\nthe drinks were also incredible. well prepared, and hearty. my azn glow was poppin off by the end of the night. \n\nservice, impeccable. might have helped that jonathon was clearing our table and stopping to chat, but our waitress was very attentive and good at recommending drinks. \n\ndefinitely coming back, and soon! although the refusal to let me see the bill and my date's sister's reaction to him telling her the price was a teeensy bit totally horrifying.\nabsolutely want to try the bar menu and the nights when they don't have only the pre-fixe menu"]
["we went to Craigie for my brother's birthday.  Lovely staff, efficient service, and the place has a great vibe.  excellent drinks (the civilian was perfect). The shrimp and artichoke, fried clams, and octopus were excellent.  The ribeye steak was too rare for me but my brother's sirloin looked great (and he loved it!).  we also enjoyed the panacotta.  the management team here gets five stars for being so professional, efficient, and pleasant.  i have a lot of respect for this place.  i hope to come back again for our anniversary in august -- can't wait!"]
['After hearing a lot of good reviews, this place failed to meet my expectations. Food was overrated, service was bad, loud like a bar.']
['Excellent restaurant.\n\nThis place seems to really know what they\'re doing and executes at a really high, consistent level.\n\nThe food is simple, and very well prepared.  Particularly remarkable was the various preparations of red meat, and unusually high quality cocktails.\n\nI would strongly advise to get a drink at Craigie, especially a whiskey one if possible.  If you want something special, give some kind of guidance and let the bar tender take it from there- if you\'ve never done that before, just say something like "I read on yelp that you make amazing drinks.  I\'d love a drink that includes tequila and isn\'t too sweet or fruity."  \n\nIt\'ll be good. So will pretty much everything you order.\n\nIf you don\'t want to shell out for the full meal, mosey on over for a drink at the bar and then head to toscaninis for dessert.  That also will be good.']
["I was home alone on December 29th, lots of snow coming down in Boston. So I decided to treat myself with some good food.\nI went for the 8 dish tasting menu. I was surprised the waiter didn't tell me anything about what I was going to be eating. In general, the service was bad. I don't know if this is a difference on service between the US and Europe (where I come from). The waitress was kind of pushy, not to say impolite but very informal. If I am paying over 100USD for dinner I expect a much better service. Also for such an expensive place, I am not expecting paper cloths and tables so close one to the other. Oh, and the lighting, I like to see what I am eating. More light would be appreciated.\nAnd the important thing: the food. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes. They were good but not impressed. I was confused with the trout with chorizo (didn't like the flavors), thought the whole weat pasta was too al dente (hard) and the starting amuse bouche of scallops tasteless. \nOne last thought: why do people put fake candles on the tables? Please, get rid of them.\nToo expensive for what I got."]
["Wow! My husband and I decided to splurge and finally made it to Craigie on Maine for a special occasion. We went all out and did the 10-course tasting menu. When we requested if perhaps one of the 10 courses could include the pigs tails on the app menu, the waiter said of course...but then let us know that it would be in place of an asparagus/bacon dish. We quickly decided to go with the asparagus/bacon dish instead - after all, chef knows best, right?! we can get the pig tails next time. \n\nthe service was great. he was helpful with wine selection and was very forthcoming with details about the food. my favorite dish was the branzino - i've never had branzino prepared like that before. my husband loved the beef tongue, which was served as the main course. and quite frankly, there wasn't a single dish we didn't love. we both agreed at the end that we had felt like we had been on an adventure and that the two and a half hour meal was as good as a weekend getaway - and cost about the same too. so worth it!\n\nlook forward to going back and trying some of the dishes off of the menu. i've heard the burger is amazing."]
["i had heard great things about this place.  seriouseats.com also did a spread on craigie a while back when one of the editors was going vegan for a month.  since my husband is veg, i thought it would be a great place to try.\n\nhe got a veg prix fixe, and i ordered a la carte.  i got the hamachi app, which was delicious, and a white fish for dinner.  i can't even pronounce the fish i tried, nor can i remember it, but it was tasty.  we shared a creme caramel for dessert.  \n\nfood was good but nothing blew me away.  ambience was great tho, and there was definitely a buzz in the place."]
['Craigie on Main is excellent in just about every way a restaurant could be -- except for the price, I suppose.\n\nThe food is delicious, locally sourced, creative, and rich. The wine list (although interestingly un-local, with only Old World wines) is expansive, the cocktails (and bartenders) are top-notch, and the service is impeccable.\n\nI took my father here for his birthday and we both got the Sunday night\'s "Chef\'s Whim," a 6-course tasting menu which included probably the best lentil soup I\'ve ever had (with a little slab of melt-in-your-mouth pork belly on top, natch), perfectly fried smelt, and a to-die-for Taza chocolate mousse dessert. If you\'re going to make it over to Craigie for a special occasion meal, I can\'t recommend one of the tasting menus enough.\n\nThe genius of Craigie, however, is that it\'s not just for tasting-menu haute cuisine experiences. I was here with friends earlier this week to try Craigie\'s legendary burger. All of the ingredients are calculated, including several cuts of fresh ground steak, bone marrow, and miso paste. Seriously. (http://www.goodeater.org/2009/11/24/cheffing-with-tony-maws-not-just-a-cheeseburger/) It\'s not going to satisfy your craving for an old-fashioned burger, but it might push the boundaries of what you think a burger could be. Coarse ground meat makes it surprisingly light and juicy -- really a treat. Accompanied with duck fat fried brussels sprouts (oh my god yes) and a top-notch charcuterie plate, it made for a decadent weeknight meal.\n\nFinally, it\'s worth noting that Craigie has a bar to back up everything. The $20 "Cocktail Whim" is well worth your cocktail dollars -- the expert bartenders will make your four miniature cocktails, drawing from a menu of both classics and more modern and original creations, starting from light, fruity, and sparkling and ending with something rich and desserty. Out cocktail flight ended with their original Jerez flip, merging sherry, Pimm\'s, Benedictine, and egg into an absolutely delicious nightcap.\n\nCraigie may not be cheap, but I\'d say it is easily worth the money. Mmmm.']
["At the heart of the restaurant, you will notice the clean open kitchen filled with chefs frantically working and occasionally getting yelled at by the head chef. It was like Iron Chef without the camera. A very uniquely interesting layout. Aside from that, I thoroughly enjoyed the nonpretentious vibe of the place. We tried the eye catching ultimate experience option. One person in our party of four does not eat beef so we advised them of that. Not sure that was the reason, but our table ended up with seafood after seafood. We kinda expected more variety. The seafood entrees didn't end until after one of us started choking on fish bone. Think they started panicking as our dining experience got pretty awkward. Fortunately, they probably got the message that we are not huge fans of strict seafood diet, so we finally got the good stuff. We all had beef while the non cow eater had a chicken dish. That saved the night. Would have been five stars if it wasn't for the fish bone course."]
['I do, I do, I do adore you....\n\nCame here last weekend... the only reservation available was one at 9 at a high table. I remember asking them "Is that enough room for all the food? My boyfriend and I eat a lot...."\n\nWe got the Chef\'s Tasting [10]... and then some... \n\nAs usual we started off with a glass of champagne [Montlouis Brut - Francois Chidaine] but continued the night with two bottles of 2000 Riesling Spätlese Dalsheimer Hubacker - Weingut Keller.. we usually like to try different wines but we loved this so much we HAD to order it again.\n\nWe got there at a great time.. the one month out of the year that Fiddlehead Ferns are in season and available. SOOO GOOD. And of course the Octopus and the Bone Marrow. YOU MUST GET THE BONE MARROW.\n\nOnto the tasting. PERFECTION.\n1. Amuse Bouche Trio - Seafood Preps\n    a. Squid Noodles\n    b.

I came home and booked for Mother\'s Day Brunch :] Shouts to our waitress Lindsay :D']
["Last night, my friend Jenny and I had dinner in the bar.  We arrived promptly at 530 to assure we got a seat at the bar which is first come first serve (ie no reservations).   The bartender (who's name escapes me) was great.  She was an extremely seasoned bar tender and it showed by her finesse behind the bar.  With an expert hand, she crafted cocktail after cocktail effortlessly.  She made for me the Ardois (Rain vodka, sage, juniper and lime) which was delicious.  There was great flavor out of this sour drink.  \n\nJenny and I decided on splitting an appetizer of the fried pig tails.  I don't know about you, I have never had pig tails before and let me tell you - these little suckers were amazing.  So rich and full of piggy flavor, fried to perfection, this dish made me a believer of the head to tail philosophy of Craigie on Main.  Then after much hype in the local news, we each had to try the famed hamburger.  Cooked to a perfect medium rare, topped with cheese, fried onions, house cured bacon, homemade ketchup and other accoutrements; this was by far one of the best burgers of my life.   You could really taste the meat which is so important.  The thick wedge cut fries that came with it were nicely crisp.  On the side, we also sampled some bone marrow and some sautéed mushrooms.  If I had any idea, how large the bone marrow side was, I probably would not have gotten it. With the pig tails, giant burger, I was bordering on being way too stuffed for my own good.  Yet the bone marrow and the mushrooms were both delicious.\n\nJust as I was about to call it quits, the amazing bar tender sent over some dessert foam that tasted like an apple pie.  I'm glad is was foam and not pie as I was so full. Speaking of full, I had no idea how full of flavor foam could be.\n\nGreat food, Great service, and nice decor.  What an amazing first impression of Craigie on Main. I'm anxious to go back, get all dressed up and try that tasting menu which I've heard so much about."]
['I went yet again and this time enjoyed the ringside seating and the tasting menu. Way cool for any foodie!']
['My wife and I were in Boston for a couple days and we chose Craigie as our "nice dinner" location. \n\nNeither she nor I had ever experienced a tasting menu, so we decided ahead of time to go with that. We also requested to sit at the counter overlooking the kitchen, which they call "ringside." We thoroughly enjoyed everything. Our server, Taylor, was extremely helpful. Although they don\'t offer a traditional wine pairing with each course, he directed us toward a couple wines which went perfectly with the food. Unfortunately I don\'t remember the specifics of each course, but I do remember each one tasting amazing. \n\nIf you\'re in the Boston area, it\'s definitely worth checking out. Next time we make it up there, I\'ll try the burger.']
["My ex took me to Craigie's original location for Valentine's Day dinner once upon a time. I can't even remember what I ate, and I'm not even sure I knew at the time--oxtail and all, with well-executed wine pairings to go along with each course--but it's kept me coming back on occasion, first to the old location, and now to the new, especially to brunch on Sundays and to the bar. When I drink, I invariably need food too, and this place has a nice little bar menu.\n\nAlso, my ex was a vegetarian at the time, but she definitely went carnivorous for the V-day occasion, and not because they didn't have a vegetarian prix-fixe menu for the night too. The meat-eaters menu simply looked that good."]
["Somewhere between the price tag and the meal size, somewhere in the ambiance and the attitude, Craigie On Main lost a star. I'm not saying the food wasn't awesome, because it was great, and the drinks too, but thanks to Yelp, the hype had me expecting gourmet orgasms, and frankly, I've had better.\n\nMaybe I'm just in the wrong age group for Craigie. When we got there at 5:30 (the only time available for a reservation), the other parties who arrived were, shall we say, in the autumns of their lives. Robust, full-salaried, pearl-earringed autumns of their lives. \n\nI got the steak special, and the BF got the two-way veal: sweetbreads and cheek, two unusual cuts of meat for our sheltered diets. It was good, but nothing worth writing home about (except that the consistency of sweetbreads makes me a little squeamish). \n\nThe atmosphere really didn't help things. It was supposed to feel cozy, I think, but the room was wide open and empty at 5:30, which made the loud shouting from the kitchen stand out all the more. The waitstaff wears jeans, which I think is supposed to reflect a relaxed, homey vibe, but there was an overwhelming air of stuffiness. Again, the place was empty, save us and some septo- and octogenarians who were giving their server the snobbiest third degree on a menu I'd ever heard.\n\nBut Yelp has convinced me to try again, with the two following points in mind - try the bar, and try the brunch. And I will, Yelp. I will. And I'll report back once I do."]
["Best restaurant in Boston right now.\n\nWe went with the chef's tasting menu (and requested no offal). At every turn we were further impressed. The Amuse bouche to kick things off set a great tone, and the chefs stepped up for each course. \n\nThis is an involved meal, and I encourage you to go in with an open mind. The waiters are extremely attentive, but not overbearing. The bartenders make a bevy of delicious libations. The chefs put on a show. This is quite a dining experience."]
["We sat at the bar to try their raved-about burger. The burger was pretty OK, but the drinks and service were outstanding. \n\nI highly recommend sitting at the bar and having a few sober drinks --- you'll really enjoy them."]
["Multiple James Beard Awards very well earned.  We decided to splurge and got the Chef's Tasting Menu.  Amazing food, great wine, and our server was super nice. It was total treat to sit at the kitchen bar and watch the well-oiled team in the kitchen prepare our food.  Looking forward to coming back for brunch."]
["Yum yum yum!  If you are a foodie, this is a must!  I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here.  My only disappointment is that there wasn't enough room in my belly to eat more!  I started with the pig's tail (sounds gross but it is good and surprisingly meaty).  I also tried all of my friend's appetizers which were all lovely including the octopus salad and the cod pieces with squid ink.  For the entree, I had the bass over risotto.  Cooked perfectly!  \n\nI cannot compliment this place enough.  They had great service.  I found parking nearby.  The hostess was friendly.  The restaurant was pre-warned that it was my friend's birthday and gave her a candle with her dessert."]
["I've been here four times now, three times for the bar and once for the 8-course tasting menu.\n\nThe bartenders at Craigie are really good and clearly take a lot of pride in their creations--one of them explained to me in great detail the symbolism behind the Bayeux Cocktail, a ridiculous mix of Calvados, aquavit, and Earl Grey. The burger is easily the best one I've had, really flavorful and perfectly medium-rare all the way through, and an amazing deal at ~$20. They make a very limited number every night, though, so you have to get there early.\n\nThe tasting menu was excellent, although it was a bit expensive for what we got."]
["Undoubtedly the best meal I've ever had.\n\nMy dad gave my wife and I a gift certificate for our anniversary.  Be warned, it was a $100 certificate and covered around half of a not-huge dinner, tip, and four or five drinks.  I'm not complaining - just be prepared.  We don't often dine at quite this level.\n\nThey were highly accommodating of my wife: provided an EXCEPTIONAL vegetarian meal that did not feel at all like the compromise/boring veggie meal given at many upscale restaurants.\n\nEverything I had was unique and delicious.  The highlight was an appetizer grilled octopus that was cooked perfectly and had a subtle and refreshing citrus flavor with no acidity.  Nearly magic.\n\nThe only place where I've ordered a 'designer' cocktail (I let our exceptional waiter choose after I told him what I usually drink) and didn't wish I had ordered a single malt instead.\n\nPromotion?  Bonus?  Proposing to a woman you just met? (Okay, that one's a little strange)... Here's a meal that truly wows.\n\nOh, and you need not be a foodie...we asked for three or four things to be explained (even though we've both worked in upscale restaurants along the way) and were answered politely, professionally, and accurately...he didn't even use the word 'basically.'"]
["I was here for Sunday brunch. Not totally bowled over, but I had a relatively good experience.  The brunch menu is quite different from the regular dinner offerings, but all sound delicious and are of course marked by the restaurant's signature use of locally sourced meat and produce. The grilled pork belly was absolutely delicious, with perfectly caramelized, melt-in-the-mouth layers of belly fat. The coriander and cashew granola was really quite special -  fragrant and savory. Can't say that the portion size (2 bites) was worth the menu price of $6, but at least it was original. The bay scallops with grits was tasty but I did expect more than the 3 medium scallops that came on my plate. The peanut butter ice cream profiteroles we had for dessert were yummy too, and, like the granola, had a pleasant salty element to them.\n\nService standards here seem to vary a lot depending on whom you have in attendance. The hostesses were friendly and attentive, and went out of their way to help us with the table settings and open the back entrance for us to wheel our pram in, for which I was grateful. The folks sitting at the bar looked like they were having a great time, and I concluded that the bar attendant was doing a great job as well. Our server, unfortunately, fell far below the standards of his colleagues. He took no initiative to offer us a high chair for my infant, was unnecessarily snarky in his replies to our questions regarding the menu, and brought out my food missing the poached egg I had ordered. I thought about asking for it but let it pass, which was just as well since it was yonks before he made a reappearance at our table."]
["Outstanding food, great service, and the best bar in Boston.\n\nAnd Sundays only, Craigie consistently delivers the best brunch experience I've ever had. Exquisite and original *morning* cocktails, a great elegant-but-energetic atmosphere, outstanding and varied food (even as a vegetarian), and impeccable service, just like they offer every evening, but customized for the most delightful Sunday morning you can find anywhere."]
['I went to Craigie on Main last night with three other people.  I have to say that we all felt this was one of the best meals we have ever had in a Boston restaurant.  Everything was sublime.  The service was superb.  Our waitress was extremely well informed, helpful, attentive and pleasant.  In addition to our waitress, about four other people attended to us.  \n\nI thought the service was well paced.  Not slow as some reviewers said.  It was paced more like a meal in a restaurant in France.  There was time in between each course to talk with each other.  Our dishes were not whisked off the table before others had finished.  We did not feel hurried or like they were trying to turn the table.  It was a nice, leisurely evening.  We were in the restaurant for about 2 1/2 hours.\n\nThe food was absolutely amazing.  We went with the prix fixe three course meals. Everything was so delicious.  I had a vegetable soup first course, swordfish entree and an ice cream with chocolate dessert.  The swordfish was the best I have EVER had.  It was moist and juicy.  Their wine list is very good.  We ordered a bottle of Meursault which was delicious.  The vanilla herbal tea was incredible.\n\nWe will be back again!']
['I keep trying new places as i have had the opportunity to travel the world and eat in some of the best restaurants. My taste spans the globe from China to India to Europe and Latin America.\n\nOnce in a while I find a place that has a high score or a very positive reputation that always leaves me wondering how can this be. Sometimes I chalk it up to a bad Chef day, to busy, ate off peak time, my own feelings that day, etc. \n\nI can honestly say, this time is was not me. I went with my girl friend and her sons for his graduation dinner two weeks back.\n\nWe ordered the Pig\'s Head, Three Pork Delight, Octopus, and Marrow appetizer. With the exception of the Octopus the rest of the food was off the charts bad. I took away a major trend from this place = The Chef/Owner did a great job in marketing his place and for the fact that most Boston restaurants don\'t really know what good food is, people flock to this place to be seen.\n\nFor 500 bucks, yes 500, we could have gone to the North End and ate for a week. the meal was not worth 5 dollars. The Chef should be "Chopped" or go back to school for a long time.\n\nIf it was possible to give this place a lower rating here i would do it!']
["After a year of their being opened, hubs and I finally made it to Craigie on Main right outside of Kendall Square in Cambridge. I had a meeting with Plummelo.com, where I will be guest blogging twice a month (check out my first post: http://blog.plummelo.com/), and since Craigie was close by and it was Thursday night, we decided to make a reservation. Highly recommended to do so. \n\nUpon arrival at Craigie on Main, we were seated at the most perfect table, all the way in the back corner. Romantic, but also ideal for a shy food blogger who HATES taking photos of food in public. I want to have them; I don't like feeling like a weirdo, and I am afraid I may get yelled at!\n\nI started the evening with a champagne cocktail, the Tavern Sparkler, which was made of the following: \n\nMedicinal Spiced Elixir \ncider, Becherovka, honey, Champagne \n\n\nDefinitely medicinal after a rushed afternoon, and delicious, this drink was the perfect way to start an autumn meal. It tasted of sweet honey and spicy cider and a slight hint of effervescence from the champagne. \n\n \n\nMy dining companion had a Piraat Amber Tripel IPA which was delicious but not as good as the beer he had later in the evening. Keep reading to find out. . . \n\nThe menu at Craigie offers a long list of tempting, local creations. \n\n \n\n \n\n\nAs you can see Craigie locally sources just about everything from places like Verrill Farm. They make their menu after buying their ingredients, ensuring the freshest food possible. Unable to decide on meals, we opted for a six course tasting menu and the staff at Craigie were very happy to accommodate my no venison, no beef, no lamb, no rabbit request. Apparently all of those proteins were options though, showing the breadth of dishes one can try at Craigie. \n\nOur first course was an amuse bouche of three seafood delights. \n\n \n\nThe middle dish is a monkfish liver, and the one on the right is crispy brandade de morue with squid ink. I can not remember what the dish on the left was, except completely delicious, I want more of it. \n\nNext up, Hiramasa sashimi with red onion shiso salsa, avocado, and harissa-rose vinaigrette. \n\n \n\nI loved this dish. The bite of the onion, the creaminess of the avocado, and the perfect fish was subtly spiced with the harissa vinaigrette. It was light and flavorful. \n\nThen there were the grilled monkfish cheeks, meaty, substantial, delicious. \n\nI think it was at this point that I finished my cocktail and requested a wine pairing. Our outstanding server brought me a glass of 2007 Grüner Veltliner 'Lois', a nearly clear Austrian wine with an acidity that went very well with the richness of the seafood. We often think of seafood as lighter, but as the meal progressed, we definitely had some very substantial fish dishes. The wine stood up to them without overcoming their flavors. This wine exemplified the elegance and flavor of the Austrian wine that we tried in Vienna, wine that was beautiful and strong, like many things Austria has to offer. . . \n\nThe hubs ordered another beer, a Foret, which was like champagne. No, not like the champagne of beers. Like real champagne, with a beautiful bubbly, yeasty  nose. \n\n\nNext up was collar of a fish whose name I can not remember (sorry!) with a salty, messy, sticky miso laced sauce. Our server made sure we had plenty of bread prior to this course, and now I know why. We wanted to mop up every drop of the sauce!\n\nThink we were done after that? Not quite yet. Our next dish was \n\nRagoût of Local Forest Mushrooms, House-Made Rabbit Sausage, Hakurei Turnips and Romanesco \nfarm-fresh egg, Macomber turnip purée, herbs\n \nThis may have been my favorite part of the entire meal. A farm fresh egg makes such a huge difference. With the crisp radish, earthy mushrooms, and ooey gooey egg yolk, this dish was both rustic and elegant. \n\nOur final savory course was grilled pork belly with pomegranate arils and a thick apple sauce, brought to us by a server and Chef Maws. \nTo end the night, our server brought us Olive Oil and Taza Chocolate Mousse and Long Island Cheese Pumpkin Parfait. They were both perfect, but the Taza chocolate mousse and olive oil offered an unbelievably rich and smooth treat. The pumpkin parfait offered exquisite fall flavors. I loved being able to taste the squash flavor of the pumpkin along with a little bit of sweetness. Again, perfect portions and balance of flavors. \n\nCraigie on Main offered such a special, delicious meal, and I can not wait to go back!"]
["Without a doubt the best tasting meal I have ever had in my life!\n\nI went with 3 friends and we all ordered the prix fixe option (3 courses for $65). If I wanted to type out a description of the entire meal it would take me days, so here is a review of the overall experience. The service was top notch; the second you clean your plate it is whisked away and another is replaced. Not only that, but we had several servers who were all completely knowledgable as to the production of each component of the meal, the source of the ingredients, and the process of the kitchen staff. We were seated with a view of the open kitchen and the staff there was professional, clean, and orderly. The rest of the dining room was small, but comfortable, well operated, and warm. You could wear jeans and a button up or a suit and tie and either way you would fit right in.\n\nThe food is incredibly unique with smaller portions, but by the end you will be more than full. I experienced more flavors in one meal than I can even remember. Highlights were the fried pig's tails, bone marrow, and the fruit galette for dessert. The presentation is nothing short of art, and the care Chef Maws takes in each component shows why he has won so many prestigious awards. I also tried a few signature drinks that were amazing in their own right and fit the overall feel of the menu. \n\nAnother thing that is superb about this place is that he sources all of his ingredients from local, organic farms, and he posts those farms right on the menu so you know where your food is coming from. While ingredients like bone marrow and pig's ears may be unconventional, it shows that Chef Maws truly works to include ALL parts of the animals he brings in, and never seems to waste anything.\n\nIf you want to splurge and enjoy an insanely good, unique, blow-your-mind dining experience at one of Boston's best, then it's a must that you try this place."]
["Craigie on Main is absolutely charming--like French countryside meets Southern hospitality. I loved the little piggy touches of decor and the open kitchen space. We came for Sunday brunch and had a lovely meal that included highlights like THE best corned beef hash and homemade donut with confiture de lait (aka caramel sauce). \n\nThe boy had the $29 prix fixe course, which was a good deal considering that it includes coffee/tea, starter, your choice of entree and dessert. We share the homemade donut as starter and it was incredible--crisp, sugared outside with a soft, cake-y inside.  Topped with a sweet caramel sauce, this was like warm bites of HEAVEN. \n\nThe boy's entree was the corned beef hash. It was really rich with great meat and potatoes flavor enhanced by a farm fresh egg and a judicious amount of creamy hollandaise sauce. I had the sausages with biscuits and gravy and while it was good, I thought it was lacking a certain richness. The biscuit was slightly tough and--dare I say it?--perhaps could've used a touch more butter. The sausages were great though.\n\nWe ended our meal with delicate profiteroles filled with calamintha (a mint-like herb) ice cream, covered in bittersweet chocolate sauce. Soooo good. The pastry was supremely light and crisp. Profiteroles are usually not my favorite dessert, but the combination of the herbed ice cream and perfect pastry shell made them stand out.\n\nAnd on a note unrelated to the delicious food, I admire Craigie on Main for being a family-run business operating on a core set of principles that allows them to be a successful and responsible member of the community. In our checkbook, I saw that they outlined these principles in detail and explained their passion for local and seasonal ingredients. I think it only adds to their charm. We walked out feeling full and pleasantly satisfied, vowing to return for dinner on another occasion!"]
["This is just for the blonde hostess. Kitchen is RAD and everyone els there is nice.  She was rude and should be gotten rid of. As an industry person, I'd never let anyone like that continue to work in my restaurant. You don't get rude and defensive just because a customer asks how long the wait is."]
["I don't ever give 5 stars, but Craigie On Main definitely deserves it. Upon walking in, I was greeted with an amazingly friendly hostess which quickly seated us. The environment is nice and RELAXED. You feel at home, but at the same time the atmosphere definitely lets you know you are about to taste some fine dining. \n\nMy friend and I started with the Rabbit Porchetta, Goat Rillette, Pâté de Campagne plate. Every single one of them were amazing. Served with thick country toast, it was easy to say that this was one tasty appetizer. \n\nWe then moved on to a plate of bone marrow. Holy Moly these were amazing. SOOO buttery and light to the taste. It's really hard to go wrong with marrow.\n\nWe ended with the Lamb three way. This dish consisted of a lamb fillet, braised beef tongue, and also pork belly. This was a great way to end the meal. Everything was cooked to absolute perfection!! It was paired with a great mix of sauteed summer vegetables. \n\nI can't say much more than for you to just try it. You're sure to get an amazing meal."]
["It took me a while to write this review, seeing as how my girlfriend and I were there in February. However, I feel that the staff at Craigie deserve every bit of it... \n\nIf i could give Craigie 10 stars I would. From the time we walked in, until the time we left, we were treated like royalty. Bar staff was great. Our server Holly was knowledgeable and helpful. The food is unbelievable. Easily one of the best dining experiences we have ever had. My girlfriend and I went with the 6 course tasting menu. After a while, we realized we had more than 6 courses, we had a total of 10. The Chef came out to explain one of the courses to us, which was a nice gesture. Thank you! \n\nIt seemed that each course was better then the last, even down to the dessert, which was incredible, and I don't have much of a sweet tooth. The atmosphere was relaxed and exciting at the same time. It was nice to see everyone working hard and taking pride in what they were doing. Chef Tony and his team made this a night to remember. I can not wait to go back...perhaps for brunch next time. Thanks again!"]
["I am so glad this is one of the fews restaurants i went to in Boston!  Pricy, but well worth it.  The whole menu was wonderfully contemporary american with french flair.  I think it is best to get a seat near the bar since they allow you to order from both menus.  The charcuterie plate is phenomenal for starters and definitely get the bone marrow for a side with you entree.   Presentation was beautiful and I appreciated the staff's patience with their explanation.  \n\nThe cons were that the drinks took way too long, staff apologized too much (caused more of a nuisance rather than making us feel better), and the front of the house was really fake and way to happy.  I realize these cons are minimal and that's why there's still 5 stars."]
["I can't even describe what my taste buds experienced. They were very happy when they were introduced to the food served at this place. I recommend doing the tasting menu. Just try everything no matter what it looks like. Service is great too. Tip: call ahead to make reservations well in advanced."]
["One of my very favorite restaurants of all time. I should clarify that I'm actually referring to Craigie St. Bistro, but unless they've done something very wrong since they moved I'm sure it's well worth 5 starts. My girlfriend and I went at least once a week (we lived on craigie circle above the restaurant's original home). I have to say that I'll definitely miss that first location. Such a great, intimate space.\n\nFantastic overall dining experience. Up there with 9 Park in my book. Tony is a genius chef. Rather than over complicate, he keeps the food simple yet elegant, and lets the excellent quality of the ingredients shine. His style and approach to food comes across in every beautifully executed plate. A testament to his love of the food, the ingredients, and the techniques. Temps are always spot on, and everything is plated with confidence and finesse. Very seasonal and you're always in for a few wonderful surprises.\n\nExcellent wine list. Lots of great bottles at great prices. Never felt up-sold. In fact, quite the opposite. I was talked into many an inexpensive gem.\n\nI don't think Will is there anymore, but if he is, you're in luck. Best server I've ever had. Anywhere. Incredibly passionate and knowledgeable. Always excited to talk about food and wine and anything else. Truly great guy.\n\nWe were often treated to wine and cheese while (if) we waited for a table. They always accommodated us in every way--Prime time on Friday night was never a problem. I guess that comes with loyalty--But it's certainly not a given. \n\nI don't have any pictures of the food, but there are plenty of great ones here already. I have nothing bad to say about CSB, er COM.\n\nOh, almost forgot! Not sure if they still do them, but look for a sunday prix fixe. Best deal in town, by a long shot!"]
["So, I know I've already reviewed this place, but I happened to go last night for dinner here with some friends and was able to order off the bar menu. This was new for me and not included in my previous reviews. A few things:\n\n1.) There was some confusion about our reservation when we arrived, but the hostess and manager on duty were amazingly kind and helpful in sorting it out. When the answer was that our reservation was going to have to be delayed a few min, the round of free libations helped. In the meantime, the entire staff continued to be really attentive and extremely kind.\n2.) I actually had a kick-ass martini here last night (my only complaint from my last post) Wohoo!\n3.) The pig tails w/ cilantro jalapeno, etc., were delicious. The jalapeno really balanced the fat of the pig tail; an excellent starter. I can also recommend the brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat. If you don't think you like brussel sprouts or ever at them as a kid, definitely try these. you'll change your mind.\n4.) The burger. I'm not a huge fan of this whole premium burger movement, to be honest, nor do I like to use superlatives in describing what can be subjective experiences so let me say this: the burger (available only at the bar, btw) was the best premium burger i've ever had. I could go on and on about how much i enjoyed it, but i won't. it's for you to decide. Just give yourself the opportunity to try it. \n5.) At less than $20 and with a mound of salad and (delicious) fries, the grass-fed burger is a full (and filling) meal that's also a great value for the money...a feat most premium burgers have never achieved."]
["After two meals there my partner and I decided it was only worth 3 stars on this rating system. Why? After all, the food is terrific and mostly locally sourced. The service is excellent, also. But we believe that the score should be for the overall experience, and that includes the experience of paying the bill. $37 for an entree may be common in New York, but in the Boston area there are many restaurants that can provide as good a dining experience with entrees in the $25-27 range. Some of them have actual tablecloths. \n\nYou are paying for the awards on the wall, not the food. If that's OK with you, fine. But we won't be back."]
["Easily one of the best meals I've had in Boston since moving here in August.\n\nWe had the chef's 6-course vegetarian tasting - not even offered on the menu, but upon hearing both my boyfriend and I are veg, our server was more than happy to accomodate us in such a personal way. Every single dish was fabulous - not always something I would order, but great to experience fresh new dishes. \n\nService was impeccable. Great wine and beer selection. Did not have any of their signature cocktails, although I've heard good things. \n\nOnly one qualm - had a 9pm reservation and it took about a half hour to get seated. But a drink at the bar was a perfectly acceptable way to begin the evening, and I can understand how unpredictable and busy Saturday nights such as that one could be."]
["Little Piggies beware!!!! This place loves pork :) ...which means I was in heaven. \n\nIan and I went for brunch and ooh and ahh'ed the entire time. There wasn't a single dish we did not finish and to finish the entire experience, we ordered the sugar donuts that came with the most delectable raspberry jam. After the donuts were gone, we started eating the jam with a spoon. Yes, it was THAT good."]
['Easily among the best French Provencal inspired cuisine I\'ve experienced in the Boston Metro region, if not the entire East Coast; Tony Mawes has done it again! With methodical innovation (while maintaining tradition), flavor and quality is abundant in every dish. A stalwart in the slow foods movement in Boston, Mawes effectively offers the best in local, seasonal, and fresh ingredients in an ever changing menu while not offending those who do not appreciate sustainable initiatives.\n\nI\'ve been to COM several times now, and every visit is filled with utter satisfaction as the service, food, beverage(s), and decor are in a league all their own. From the warm, home-like feel in the dining room to the aromas emanating from the kitchen, there is simply not enough acclamation I could pay to this establishment for all of their efforts and grandeur.\n\nMy sister who, God bless her, is a vegetarian even tried the rabbit sausage, unbeknown to her, and loved it! Certainly, there is something for everyone at COM and a discriminant palate, while appreciative of the more technical aspects of the food\'s preparation, is not required. \n\nI would obviously endorse anyone\'s inclination to go here; missing the opportunity while in this city would be truly your misfortune. Yes, it is rather pricey, but this is a case where I am confident that you will be getting what you pay for. \n\nI would recommend reservations since dinner can get crowded and bar seating is as pleasant as the dining room, so don\'t be dissuaded if your party does not want to "settle" for the bar. This is a great place for a date, a family gathering, after work dinner, and an impressive meal with your friends; and I honestly cannot wait until I get the chance to go back here again.']
["I'm psyched that this place is a few blocks from my house yet my wallet is very upset at my exuberance.  My bro + I ate brunch at this establishment yesterday and it was outstanding.  We both had skirt steak + eggs with a well-prepared cocktail = food coma!  \n\nThe chipped ice/turn-of-the-century cocktail bar was a pleasant surprise."]
['The food was sort of amazing... We got pig\'s tail and the terrine plate to start. Pig\'s tail was surprisingly awesome. It kind of reminded me of really good Chinese-style spare ribs to be honest. The terrine plate was just "meh." \n\nShared a pig\'s head with a side of bone marrow. There was just two of us, so I have to admit that we were over-zealous with the amount of food, but since we were there, we figured might as well go all out. The pig\'s head: creamy, buttery, crispy on the outside, and definitely fatty. They give you these warm (but kind of oily) pancakes on the side to roll up with some pumpkin slaw and hoison sauce (reminding me of Chinese-style Peking duck). It was delicious...  Bone marrow... it was like eating butter. \n\nFood is definitely too rich to be eaten in one sitting. We had plenty of left overs to bring home, happily. Great experience. We want to come back to the regular tasting menu. We saw other tables get it and all the courses looked awesome (and not as lethally rich as our meal was).\n\nService: I found everyone to be quite awkward. From the host to the back-waiters who served and who filled water. Our main server was more sociable, but he was so busy with all the other tables, we received lackluster service. Definitely surprised and slightly bummed by this...']
['Great food and amazing service.  Every employee we encountered was so nice and genuine, and the food was out of this world.  Went on a Sunday night, sat at the bar, and ordered their tasting menu.  Highly recommended!!']
["I came here for my fiance's birthday (two years ago) and we had a wonderful time here. \n\nThe food was good... I enjoyed the bone marrow and my fiance liked his swordfish entree. But we both found his lamb appetizer too sweet and my chicken entree too salty. BUT their drinks, dessert and service were excellent!"]
["If you are hooked on the Travel Channel's Bourdain and Zimmern and want something out of the ordinary this is the place for you.  The service was awesome (at the bar, the only place we sit), the menu was eclectic, the decor outstanding.  We got fried pig's tails, Hirmasa tuna shashimi, and roasted bone marrow sides.  \n\nIt's a very cool place to hang out, my martini was $10, thats not bad, for the two of us it ran about $80.  \nThe only bummer is there is no TV in the bar so if you want to see/hear any games its a no go.  Other than that its really a must check if you are a foodie."]
["Absolute garbage.  I have no idea how this place is rated so highly.  We ordered the 6 course tasting menu, which puts you at the whim of the chef.    For our main course, we received the pork shoulder. So many servers came by to tell us how lucky we were. While well cooked, it was incredibly bland. I was about to type out all of the other courses that we had, but every single one other than the mushroom pasta was terrible, so it wasn't worth my time.  Cragie's already stole 3 hours of my time and $330, I'm not going to let them steal any more of my time."]
['I cannot decide if I love or hate a particular dish at Cragie....so I\'ve been waiting for my epiphany!\n\nWe went ther Cragie for a friend\'s birthday dinner. It was a weekday and it was still packed when we got there around 830-9. We had a reservation but we still had to wait for a little bit...didn\'t mind at all as the server and the host were very attentive, gave us suggestions about drinks and talked to us almost the entire time.\n\nLater we were seated at the bar area (they did ask us if that was okay) and handed the menus. We ended up getting the Pri-Fixe and my love-hate dish "THE PIG HEAD"!\n\nFor appetizer, we had the rabiit sausage/pig blood, a potato/watercress soup, and the rigatoni. I LOVE the rabbit sausage dish, everything was cooked perfectly even the pigs blood!\n\nFor entrees, we had the skirt steak, pork loin with sweet bread, and ****THE PIG HEAD****! My friend got the skirt steak and she liked it. I got the pork loin and it was good...perhaps I was a little bit full at that point, I didn\'t think the dish was outstanding. Last but not least, THE PIG HEAD! OH MY MY MY, the meat was super tender, very juicy, basically it just dissolved in my mouth. The reason why I hated it for a moment was because the way you eat it. It\'s basically half a pig head served on a white plate, with a knife and a fork. At first I could still eat and look at it...but later I had to ask my husband to cut the meat for me as the "head" became kind of disgusting to look at. This dinner was a couple months ago and I can still remember the flavor of the pig head...I think it\'s fair to say I LOVE this dish and definitely will go back for it again!\n\nThe service was great at Cragie. Our server explained all the items to us patiently and also gave us recommendations.\n\nOh, do try the ginger drink if you like ginger. Both my friend and husband loved it!\n\nI will probably go more often if its not as expensive...don\'t get me wrong though, Cragie does live up to their $$$$!']
["This past weekend, my wife and I enjoyed the 6-course tasting menu: a relaxed and delicious 2-hour experience. Tastes were amazing and portions perfectly sized. In the CoM tasting, there isn't a selection you make from a list for each course It's based on what's fresh that morning (menu is printed daily and is based on what is purchased that day...love that!).\n\nService was excellent, but slightly marred by the fact that timing on 2 courses was a bit off and we were left impatiently waiting. In one, we had finished our wine and were not about to order more, so that timing issue detracted from the meal. Our server (and the host of servers that helped) did an excellent job especially with wine suggestions.\n\nCoM doesn't have a a good bar scene as there is no place to comfortably stand. Even standing around the bar, the wait staff comes to take your drink order and are very attentive, but it feels very awkward. There are tables for diners around the bar and the bar was packed with people enjoying an evening meal. I'd say forgo getting there early for a drink.\n\nDespite the price and the quality, the crowd isn't ultra-dressy. Wait staff and most patrons had jeans. \n\nDefinitely a worthwhile experience. If you're keeping score, I think Pigalle still has the best tasting meal with paired wines in Boston."]
["Brunch with a larger party.  Service was very good.  Drinks were good.  Food was shockingly bad.  An incessantly praised chef and restaurant and with a brunch sandwich not fit for fast food.  3 at the table ordered it.  All agreed.  A Burger was undercooked.  Out of French fries so we were served potato galettes that were super super salty.  We were at the end of the brunch serving window... Totally felt like they mailed it in for the last table.   Terribly disappointing.  I'm no dining rookie.   End of the day it comes down to the food.  Craigie was way off their game.   p.s.   The pretentiousness only makes it worse when the food isn't good."]
["Hands down my favorite dining experience. Amazing food, amazing decor, wonderful service. I'd take a trip to Cambridge from NY just to eat here, it's that good."]
["if you are ready to put down the money, you can't do much better than Craigie.  Tony Maws continues to reliably put out incredible food.  The space is alive with energy, but has plenty of quieter spaces where you can pay full attention to your food if you wish to.\n\nMost of the staff seem to really love the food and take pride in  providing a great experience in a top notch restaurant. \n\nSuggestions:    Avoid peak hours as Craigie can get a little zooey.  Also, consider some of the off-hours pice fixe specials - such as the late Sunday (after 9PM) Chef's whim and the pre-theater dpecials."]
['alas, bc i cannot afford dinner here. this review is for brunch.\n\nprix fixe brunch for 29$ includes coffee and tea. seems pricey for brunch. buttt if you think about. its 2 meals (breakfast and lunch). and considering its the best meal of your life. its totally worth it.\n\nhomemade donut, dunkin has nothing on this donut. try it for yourself. it comes covered with a light caramel-like sauce. \n\ncame with a party of 4, everything we ordered was spectacular. menu changes from time to time. everything that touched our lips was amazing. so you cant go wrong if you just make it here to eat, everything will be perfect. see photos... if youre like me, visual guides are key :)']
['Excellent. We did the 8 course tasting menu. It was a great way to experience their menu. I highly recommend this place. It is a little casual for the high quality of the food that was kind of refreshing.']
["Wonderful dinner tonight.  Our first time at your wonderful establishment but certainly not her last.  Caitlyn was our server, but we also got to talk to Karin, Kim, Ari and quite a few others.  Terrific experience. Great food. We'll happily be back."]
["This review is quite possibly the easiest review I will ever write.  I could take the easy route and just say it this restaurant is incredible, groundbreaking, and sets the bar like no other restaurant I've been to, and this would suffice.  \n\nThis place is so amazing I am almost speechless..and a bit overwhelmed because I want to go into extreme detail about everything..but not this review.  I'll save that one for the next time around.  \n\nThe service was wonderful.  All of the waiters were knowledgeable, friendly, polite and encouraging of questions.  They all made sure to let us know that they would accommodate us in any way they could - from the drinks to the actual food, and they did.\n\nThe menu is incredible.  As a vegetarian, it was one of the few times that I actually regretted not eating meat because I felt as though I was seriously missing out.  Every plate that was brought to us not only looked perfect, but tasted perfect.  Even though we didn't really eat a lot of food or drink a lot, we were still treated like favored patrons, and were given not 1, or 2 or 3 but 4 complimentary dishes.  One of the complimentary dishes given to us was raw tuna, and one of my friends is pregnant, and I am a vegetarian, and they were so gracious about taking them back - and bringing out yet another complimentary dish that was vegetarian, and so delicious that I couldn't help but savor every single bite.  \n\nWe sat at a spot that gave us a direct view of the open kitchen.  We were literally sitting a few feet away from where the kitchen staff performed something akin st synchronized swimming.  There are some folks that when they go out to eat, prefer to not see their food being made because it takes away from their appetite, but me? Watching these men and women at work...the accuracy and dedication that went into each dish being prepared, made me want to taste everything they were making.\n\nI have not had a dining experience like this in so long...I plan to go back and spend half a weeks paycheck in one sitting.\n\nI can't stress enough how incredibly wonderful the staff is at this place.  EVERYONE seemed to be in tune with each other, but more importantly in tune with the diners.  \n\nCraigie is worth every cent spent...and more.  And though my next statement has nothing to do with food, it added to my atmosphere - there were two chefs who were very hot, one who I kind of couldn't stop looking at (heh)...and watching them making this food that could be considered art, made my dining experience that much better.\n\nI never thought I would find a place where I was happy with everything...but I have found that place with Craigie on Main...and I am already planning my next visit, where I will have the full vegetarian meal, and as many of their amazing cocktails as I can stomach.\n\nIt is pricey, but I can honestly say that here, you get what you pay for...which is excellence created by passionate people who are good at what they do and work hard at it.\n\nI highly recommend this place to anyone who is looking for an all around incredible dining experience, and if you are lucky to sit by the open kitchen, I suggest you take the seats...because it is a show worth watching...even though the performers are not really performing (they are only focused on what they are doing, not who is watching), but creating meals that please all of the senses.\n\nSimply put? I am in love with this place and plan on going there any and every chance I get."]
['It took me 4 years to get here and I was expecting to lament that I had missed out on 4 amazing years of dining experience.  Instead, I\'m not lamenting.  All the dishes were well executed - a little on the salty side but overall, well balanced.  However, there wasn\'t a single dish with unexpected flavour combinations that vaulted my palate into another universe.  The meal crescendoed at the beginning with each course better than the last and then things slowly petered out with dessert completely falling flat.  I left thinking that this won\'t end up being a memorable experience.\n\nATMOSPHERE - The decor is really consistent with a bistro, which is discordant with the level of cuisine they are trying to achieve.  I really enjoyed the homey atmosphere with the open view of the kitchen.  However, after 3 hours of sitting on a hard wooden chair, I was wishing I was at L\'Espalier.\n\nSERVICE - I thought service was extremely slow.  There was a significant lag time between dishes with our entire dining experience being 3.5 hours for 10 courses.  \n\nFOOD - They served Iggy bread, which is definitely one of my preferred bakeries.  It made me a little sad that they didn\'t bake their own bread but I wont knock off points for that....better to buy bread than bake crappy bread.\n\nThree Chilled Seafood Preparations (tempura-fried cod cheek with squid ink, squid noodles with nuoc cham, house-cured trout) - Meh.  Nothing on this dish tasted great.  The nuoc cham is meant to be a dipping sauce so when you douse the squid noodles in it, it\'s extremely salty.  The cod cheek was well fried but uninteresting.\n\nSalad of Scallop Sashimi (green tomato-red onion, melons (watermelon, cantaloupe, and honey dew) and lemon-caper vinaigrette) - This was a lovely dish.  I think they slightly overdid the citrus but the scallops were sweet and well complemented the melon.\n\nMiso and Marinated Australian Cobia (Wellfleet and razor clams, roasted cherry tomatoes, pistou-dashi broth) - This was the highlight of the evening.  The flavours were delicate and the fish perfectly cooked.\n\nRed Snapper Collar - This was initially introduced as Hirmasa collar but I know my fish and this was no Hirmasa.  After some further inquiry, it was red snapper.  It was smothered in this sauce that was really reminiscent of Szechuan cooking except without the spiciness.  Overall, the sauce was heavy handed and overwhelmed the delicate fish flavour.  I could have done without this course.\n\nSheep\'s milk cheese and squash Tortellini (broccoli purée, purslane, squash blossoms) - I could have done without this dish as well.  The puree inside the tortellini was so mashed up that it completely lacked texture and discernible flavours.\n\nGrilled Vermont Organic Pork Belly (crab, mustard greens, smoked cinnamon, hominy) - The pork belly was well cooked but uninteresting.\n\nElysian Fields Lamb Chop with Roasted Sweetbreads (farro verde, summer vegetables, kohlrabi purée) - The lamb was again well cooked but uninteresting.  It was just a lamb chop on a plate.  The sweet breads were fried and extremely grease laden.\n\nHouse-Made Sorbets - There were 3 of us and we each got a different flavour - yogurt, blackberry, and plum.  The plum was delicious.  I would have called this an amuse bouche but it was hardly a course.\n\nCreamy Anson Mills Corn Grits (demerara brulèe, lemon-thyme ice cream, warm blackberry compote) - I don\'t know what to say about this course.  Grits as dessert turns out not to be a winner.  It wasn\'t horrible, it just wasn\'t a dessert.  The other two people in our party got a sheep\'s milk cheesecake and a panna cotta with banana cream.  \n\nRhubarb-Hibiscus Mousse (buttermilk foam) - Two problems with this.  1) It just didn\'t taste good at all (bordering on yuck) and 2) It\'s in a tiny shot glass and hardly constitutes as a course.  I felt cheated.\n\nI\'ll be back only because the "Milk Fed Pig\'s Head for Two" has caught my attention.  However, they seriously need to find themselves a new dessert chef.  In general, I like savoury courses over the sweet ones but dessert is not a course to be disregarded.  You need to end the meal on a positive note.']
["What a beautiful experience. We had the luck/pleasure of eating at the Chef's table, so we were able to watch first hand all the passion and meticulous craftsmanship that goes into delivering our delicious food. Simply incredible."]
['LOVED IT! \n\nI went with four of my girlfriends for Sunday brunch and we all got something different, and tried and tasted of everyones dish and EVERYTHING was AMAZING!!!! loved it!!!!\n\nA little pricey, but def. WORTH IT.\n\np.s. the homemade donut just melts in your mouth~']
["For me this place was just excellent.  I think the combination of service, ambiance and food were just great.\n\nI went with a friend for the 6 course chef's whim.  My friend got the vegetarian whim and i got the everything whim.  No matter vegetarian or not the whims were filling and great.  Each course was unique and interesting.  They took the time to explain the ingredients in everything and also answered any questions we had about them.  We got a couple glasses of wine to go with the meal too.  The waiters were excellent at recommending what went with our meal.  I don't remember exactly what was on the whim but almost all the dishes were not on the menu. \n\nAll i remember is after the end of the meal i was in full and extremely happy.  Especially since they ended with the sheep cheesecake.  \n\nIf you are around on sundays after 9pm and want to take someone for an unique dinner take them here.  You won't be disappointed.  Your wallet won't hate you that much either."]
['My dining experience at Craigie On Main may have been my best, ever.\n\nFirst of all, I love what they have done with the place. It is an amazing restaurant, but it\'s not pretentious. All the waiters wear a black shirt and jeans and the tables are simple, dignified wood.\n\nAnd the food - ohhh the food. We got the four course meal, and while I wasn\'t wow\'d by the bite sized first course (this may have been my fault - I ate it in small pieces and I think you\'re supposed to just stick the whole thing in your mouth and chew), the other courses were incredible.\n\nThe sashimi was a heavenly mixture of tastes and textures (soft and crunchy) and the venison was incredible. We also had ordered a side of brussels sprouts in duck fat - yes, yes. My scallops were also amazing, and the dessert was delectable (I have never, never used that word before) and it came with a generous serving of port - yum!\n\nIt\'s hard to express through writing how completely amazing this restaurant was. This isn\'t food, it\'s like art that you eat. It was absolutely incredible, and as soon as my bank account is replenished, I will go back. I could gush all day about this place, and I still wouldn\'t do it justice.\n\nAlso, this review is really long already, but the cocktails were fantastic!\n\nA word of warning - do not go hungry (peckish I would say is okay): the quantities are small, and though your tastes buds may be overwhelmed, your stomach will be just fine. They cook every thing to order, so you can expect your meal at least an hour after you sit down. If you\'re like me, and your hunger can cause you disengage from reality (my friends call it "murdering hungry"), definitely have a snack beforehand. There is bread, but, you know, I get hungry!']
["Simply Amazing! I went recently for my anniversary and had the tasting journey and wine pairing. Everything was delicious, but the slow-cooked salmon was the best item they served. Fully cooked and super tender. I have even tried to replicate the experience at home. You can duplicate with any  salmon recipe. Slow-cook room temperature Salmon at 200F for 20 to 30 minutes (You can't over cook it)."]
['Feeling adventurous? Save up and do the 10 Course Chef\'s Tasting. I believe it may be the best way to experience the range of deliciousness and inventiveness available at Craige on Main. \n\nI took my parents here during their last visit (August 2009) - after realizing that not only the Elephant Room &amp;amp; Cuchi Cuchi were totally closed on a Sunday night - we showed up an hour before our reservation and tried to unsuccessfully find room at the bar. Fortunately, the staff stepped in and cleared out a bar table for us to roost in while waiting for our diner table to open up.\n\nWe were seated a little before when our reservation was supposed to start in the far back corner. I wish we were seated closer to the window, especially since all the tables were not filled but our waiter turned out to be awesome. After looking over the menu a bit, our waiter came over and told us about Craige and the options available to us. After not -too- much deliberation we decided on the 10-course Chef\'s tasting which is about $125 per person. \n\nOur first few courses were light and fresh - almost entirely seafood based. There was everything from squid noodles to a delicious piece of lobster salad to a plump juicy scallop. They were all delicious but the next 3 savory courses were incredible. A couple of those stand out in memory - especially the Sweetbreads and Chicken Confit plate and the Lamb three ways: OMG. Those were seriously out of this world. Our waiter was really helpful in telling us about everything on on our plate and kept the water, drinks and wine coming for our table. It was quite an experience. \n\nOur dessert courses were so unique (there were 3 of those) - one course was a tea-infused Panna Cotta - Absolutely amazing - the tea tingled my senses and I highly recommend this if your are a fan of herbal, light desserts. We were also served 4 different things all in the same course - each of us got a different plate and we took turns sampling each other\'s plates - Out of that course the Taza Chocolate Mousse stood out as well as a Peanut Butter Ice Cream dessert that was out of this world. \n\nI recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to splurge on a true culinary experience. The chef even came out to talk to us. Craige, thank you for an awesome experience vs "just a meal" - I will and my family will be back!']
["Yeah, they are good, and that cannot be said as much as I would like in Boston.  They have creativity too.  On the night I went they might have lagged a smidge behind a 27+ rated Zaggat's restaurant in NYC.....but you can also get out of there for under $200 for two, which might be a stretch at WD-50 or something.  You can also get reservations and there is parking.  The only complaint I had is that the cheese plate was a little stingy....I mean like barely enough of each cheese for two little mouth full's worth.  Also, on the night I was there, they did not absolutely crush it in terms of the vibrancy of their recipes....but that happens once in a blue moon at all but a 3 star Michelin restaurant in France."]
['This is a review for the bar only. Knowledgable bartenders really talked me through the Libations list. It seems like most of the Libations list had confusing ingredients on it. Not only that, but they explained the menu too and were very helpful but also professional. I could see they were busy making libations but they struck just the right balance between helping the customer and making libations. Bravo guys!  My GF and I were seriously impressed with you guys!!!']
['Went Last Friday and We had: Last Smash and Moscow Mule Cocktails, Domaine Cheveau Macon Chardonnay, Cheese Plate, Bone Marrow, salad, Loup de Mer, and the Swordfish. Total bill: 185 before tip, Very reasonable.\n\nAll the food was delicious. Though my swordfish seemed bland (it was a delicate umami flavor) I blame myself for ordering a mild flavored dish after eating rich and awesome bone marrow (my first time). Her entree and salad were both excellent and the cheese was phenomenal. Cocktails were out of sight and the wine was very nice.\n\nThe service was average. Our server was attentive, but in a pushy way and after every sip of water a staff member topped off our glass of water. Also the bar high top chairs felt purposefully uncomfortable with short cushions and no place to rest your feet.\n\nOverall, we were treated very well and enjoyed our evening immensely. The wine list was priced a little steep, but I am comparing it to other lists, that are purposefully reasonably priced. The food was very very good. The service was totally adequate, and the atmosphere was fun. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is, that I had really high expectations for the "best" restaurant in Boston and felt that it fell a little flat. I am totally going to give it another try though!']
["We went back here for dinner, so I'm going to update this post--it was a much better experience.  \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the food: oysters, lobster/artichoke soup (type thing), bass and pork three ways.  The service was attentive (our waitress, Ann, was helpful.)  \n\nOverall, the ambiance was fine--nothing special, and there were several empty seats, which surprised us.  The #1 issue with Craigie on Maine is that it is very expensive.  We had a $150 gift certificate, and still paid $80.  With all of the excellent restaurants in the area, it's simply hard to justify spending over $100 per person--on a dinner that isn't life changing.  That said, it's high quality so I'm going to up this from one star to three.  \n\n***************\n\nI was extremely disappointed.  We had a 1:30pm reservation on Sunday for 5 people and I tried calling ahead to squeeze in a 6th person - but no one picked up - and when we came for our reservation, the staff freaked out at me that we'd dare bring another person.  They claimed they didn't have a spare chair in the entire place...we went to the bar, got some (JUST OK) bloody maries and bided our time until the table -- which was perfectly fine for 6 people -- was ready. \n\nI think they realized that they overreacted when the restaurant basically emptied out after 20 minutes.  The kicker was that they ran out of the burger, sausage and one of the only three savory dishes on the very short brunch menu.  \n\nMaybe dinner is better here, but brunch sucked.  The waitress was rude...and the food was pretty mediocre.  The bill high.  Not impressed!!"]
['Great experience, great food.\n\nWe had a 6:30 reservation on Sunday night.  We arrived at around 6:20 and were seated right away.  Through Open Table I had requested a "comfy table" because we were planning on having the 10 course tasting menu.  They seated us against the window at a nice table. \n\nOur waitress came over immediately and brought water, and said that she heard we were interested in the tasting menu.  I thought it was super that they paid attention to the OT reservation request.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of wine, and it came out just before our first course, which was a fish foie, squid noodles, and brandade on top of squid ink.\n\nQuick rundown of the courses (all excellent - the boar could be my favorite):\n\nSecond course - scallop ceviche\nThird course - seared fish.\nFourth course - trout collar - very good, dangerous bones!\nFifth course - wild boar ragout on some pasta.\nSixth course - pork belly with pomegranate and maybe chestnuts\nSeventh course - pheasant\n\nThen there were three dessert courses - panna cotta (two different kinds),  the last was a hot chocolate with cardamom and chili.  Who would have thought to put those flavors together?  But they work!\n\nThe food was fantastic.  Flavors were spot on, and it was a nice progression of the meal.  Nothing was too heavy, and I didn\'t feel over-stuffed (well, until I put that last dessert course in my mouth).\n\nIt was expensive, but not more than we were expecting.   \n\nCraigie on Main is aces, baby!']
['We went to dinner last night with some friends, one of whom owns a restaurant in New York City, and none of us left overly impressed. While the menu selection was certainly innovative and the kitchen staff talented, we weren\'t blown away by the food. In all fairness that was our opinion of the offerings, and everyone\'s palate and tastes are different. So I would recommend that you at least try it because so many people do seem to enjoy it. \nOur biggest issue was with the service. We found our primary server to be condescending and unaccommodating. She answered the majority of our questions with a yes or no, no elaboration or explanation. For example 2/4 of us wanted to order the tasting menu. Her response to our order was, "no, the whole table has to order the tasting menu". And then she just looked at us. That was it. It was so uncomfortable. She didn\'t offer an alternative or maybe offer an explanation. This "rule" was not on menu. So was it even true? We would ask her, "can we do/have .....", her answer, "No". And everything was "super delicious". Could she have offered additional information? Yes. Did she? No. A restaurant of this level should have a staff that can offer why the plates are "super delicious" and willing to at least entertain your requests. Truthfully, it was almost as though we were being treated as though we were too stupid to understand so it was easier for her to just say as little as possible. Overall, I felt as though she was treating us as if we should have been grateful to have the privilege of dining there. It was truly obnoxious.  However, the server who offered us dessert was lovely. She smiled, was lively and bright and engaged us. She certainly made up for the other\'s lack of personality. \nNow here is why we ALL had a problem with that type of treatment, we spent over $500 on dinner. That is a premium to spend on dinner in Boston, and the staff, all of them, have an obligation to put their best foot forward and accommodate the patrons with a willingness to at least TRY and placate them. This didn\'t happen and for that reason we will not return to Craigie on Main. I would rather frequent Mistral or L\'Espalier where we are respected and welcomed into their establishment.']
['I\'ve only been here for brunch so far, so that\'s the limit of my knowledge. But this brunch literally rocked my socks. It was awesome. First of all, the bloody mary was great and that\'s my first test of a brunch place. It makes my list of best bloody marys. They even offer a few different vodkas (pepper infused, vegetable infused), which is neat.\n\nBut they followed up with an equally awesome meal. I had the hash. And normally hash is a tasty diner food. But they made it something special, like a diner made out of pure gold. It was corned beef and tongue hash. It had home fries in it. And it had fried onion strings on top. The flavors combined so well. It was a one-of-a-kind dish, it was breakfast reinvented. They also had less "out there" dishes if you\'re not a tongue fan. So, don\'t be scared off by that.\n\nIf I won the lottery, I would eat here every day and get very fat and very happy.']
['This review will not be helpful in any particular way other than to say that my husband and I have never been so thrilled to spend our money on a remarkably expensive dinner , a dinner with no regretful moments concerning the service and more importantly the food. It is safe to say that I will be  salivating at the very thought of our dinner for weeks to come.']
["It's without a doubt one of the top kitchens in Boston -- superb food -- but is it a top restaurant? \n\nDepends on you -- as for me: it's too dark and crowded and noisy.  Some may love the energy of the intimate room with open kitchen.  I find it makes enjoyment of the meal and conversation difficult.\n\nThe service doesn't equal L'Espalier or #9 Park or Hamersley's -- and it is much busier and louder than either of the first two.   It is probably best compared to the other leading French Bistro in town Hamersley's - I give the edge on food to Craigie but on service and atmosphere Hamersley's wins.    I rate it better on food than Mistral - better on service and inferior on atmosphere.\n\nAs for dining in Central or Kendall Sq area, I'm not sure the food at Craigie (while wonderful) is really worth the high prices when you could go to the Blue Room or EVOO or Hungry Mother for an excellent dinner at a more reasonable price point."]
["I took my husband here for his birthday last night. We did the 10-course tasting which was excellent. The waitstaff was wonderful and our server in particular, Johnathan, was very helpful and informative. He made great suggestions for wine and made sure to ask us about our preferences for the tasting. The food was excellent and the environment was unpretentious. I tasted some foods which I never would have tried and ended up liking everything. The most adventurous thing we had was the veal sweetbread.I don't typically eat beef but it was prepared very well and it was my husband's favorite dish.\n\nWe were at the restaurant for almost 5 hours but we could have done it in about half the time if we wanted to. My suggestion would be to save some money and splurge for one of the tasting menus. We did spend a lot of money especially since we got 2 bottles of wine and 2 dessert drinks but it was worth it for a special occasion. I would definitely recommend going here for the tasting menu at least once for the experience."]
["I love this place and I can't believe I have not reviewed it.  Really everything here has been said, I just wanted to recommend two things.  \n\n1) Sunday night chef's whim.  Great value and same amazing flavors.\n2) The bartenders - let them help you find the perfect cocktail or wines or beers...whatever.  These guys know flavor and make some outstanding drinks."]
["I could not have been more impressed with my 1st visit to Craigie on Main. The food was amazing, the service was impeccable, plus the Chef's Table experience was out of this world. It was like we were inside of an Iron Chef showdown. Try their ten course tasting menu, it was 3 incredible hours of perfection."]
["This place is amaaaaaazing. Yelp should let me give this place an entire galaxy of stars to rate it. \n\nI've been here twice now - once for birthday dinner at the bar, another time for Sunday brunch at a table like a civilized person - and both times were mind blowing. The food is seriously the best out there, service is impeccable and ambiance is superb. \n\nThe best part? You can order anything off any menu and it is guaranteed to be the best that they can give you. Tony Maws and his awesome team know their way around a kitchen and this girl's tummy, for sure. It doesn't hurt that the bartenders know their way around cocktails equally as well. Well, that part might hurt the next day if you're not careful. But knowing you had a fantastic meal should more than make up for it."]
['I went to brunch with two friends (at their urging) and was looking forward to trying one of the best restaurants in Cambridge. What happened next was simply stunning.\n\nOur reservation was for 1pm and we arrived and no table was available. Finally at 1:22pm they seated us without any comment/apology for the wait. We ordered our drinks (2 cocktails and their blend of  coffee) both of which were quite good, then after several minutes our order for our meal was taken. We waited for about 40 minutes without any acknowledgement of the delay and then were finally told it would be out in 2 minutes (no apology was offered). It finally came about 10 minutes later. We ordered the hamburger, lamb crepettes (sp?), and the beef tongue hash. The Hamburger was quite good and cooked rare as requested, the lamb was not that flavorful and dressed with some old greens but it was fine, and the beef tongue hash was quite rich (as it should be) and egg cooked correctly so no complaints there. \n\nThe waiter asked us if the food was ok in a very defensive way knowing we were annoyed about the long delay to which we said it was fine but to ask us again after we had finished. After we finished the meal my friend offered a few small critiques about the food and he completely lost it. He called him a "fat f@!#" and "I\'ll take your fat a@@ outside right now and beat you up." Everyone was stunned as he walked away and nothing happened for several minutes. Finally one of my friends went to get the manager who appeared and apologized profusely and comped the entire meal wanting us to email him with our critiques (which I appreciated but I was seriously shaken up by the previous event).\n\nAdmittedly my friend is a tough critic, but how is a restaurant supposed to improve if you don\'t point out their deficiencies? In any case, there was absolutely no excuse for the behavior of that waiter especially at a restaurant of this reputation. It was a scene out of a movie and I still can\'t believe it actually happened. I hope the restaurant will take the appropriate action against that person.']
['I realize that my dissenting view won\'t really change folks\' impression of Craigie, but I\'m going to stick to my guns and offer only three stars.  Here\'s why:\n\nFriends and I came in for the 4 for $40 "Chef\'s Whim" special on a Sunday night.  We were a tad bit early, so we mozied on over to the bar area to get cocktails.  We reviewed the drink list.  While we were favorably impressed by the originality of the mixes, we were unfamiliar with most of the drinks, so we asked our server for some help.  "They are all well-balanced and delicious," she said.  Ummm, okay, but maybe some specifics?  "I don\'t know.  I\'m Mormon so I don\'t drink."  I\'m not recommending religious discrimination, but putting a Mormon in charge of taking cocktail orders seems like a bad idea.  I ended up getting an Old Fashioned, so I could at least tell if the bartender could make a good drink in addition to putting on a good show.  (Imagine a hipster in a buttoned vest shaking up cocktails epileptic seizure style.)  Result: the drink was a little flat, overly sweet with few bright notes.\n\nOn to the meal.  We were seated in the bar area since the main room was over capacity.  Our new server confirmed that we were there for the Sunday special and asked if we wanted wine.  "Sure, what would you recommend?" we asked, not knowing what the Chef\'s whim might be.  "What kind of wine do you like?"  "Well, do you think a red or a white will go better with the menu?"  "Oh, I have no idea what Tony\'ll serve, do you like reds or whites better?"  "I suppose reds, generally speaking."  "What kind of reds?"  "I\'d probably go with a pinot noir for versatility," I say, feeling like I\'m doing the waiter\'s job.  "Oh, we have a great pinot," he replies, pointing out the most expensive pinot on the menu.\n\nWhile we are finishing our cocktails, a smoked bluefish amuse bouche comes out.  But it isn\'t announced as an amuse, so we are trying to figure out if this half-teaspoon of food is the first course or the amuse.  It\'s pretty tasty and pairs well with the wine.  What luck!\n\nThe next course is three slivers of hamachi with compressed watermelon, cukes and a slightly spicy fatty sauce smeared across the plate.  The watermelon is interesting, but the hamachi is only average.  (Maybe Los Angeles has me spoiled with its quality sushi?)  Also, altogether, there\'s about an ounce of fish on the plate.  Our server still hasn\'t clarified if we are on our first or second course, so we\'re a little worried.  "Maybe we\'ll stop at McDonald\'s on the way home," my pal jokes.  Also, the pinot doesn\'t match up with this course at all.\n\nTwo runners approach with plates of fried clams.  They are light and crispy on the outside and perfectly tender and savory on the inside.  The sauce offers a little tart and spicy contrast.  I\'m finally starting to see what the fuss about Craigie is about.  My friend, however, seems more concerned about going home hungry.  Since the Chef\'s Whim menu promises a dessert as the fourth course, he\'s worried that this was the last savory course.  And our waiter has been missing for the past 20 minutes.  When he finally passes a nearby table, we hail him, asking if the smoked bluefish was an amuse bouche or one of the courses.  He looks completely confused.  "Is it possible to switch to the six-course $55 menu?" my hungry companion requests.  "Yes, but you\'ll only get one more course then."  "What?"  (My math skills are somewhat rudimentary, but 4+1=6???)  "Is there another course coming?"  "Yes, you\'ll have one more course."  "Well, if only dessert is coming next, then we\'d like to upgrade to the six-course, even if it\'s only five, I guess."  "Oh no, steak will be served next, then dessert."  \n\nWe cancel the upgrade.  The confusion, unfortunately, has distracted us from how good those clams were.\n\nOnce more the runners appear, quickly shuffling out with pan-finished steak, running away from the screamed orders emanating from the kitchen.  (I\'m pretty happy that we didn\'t get those prized ringside seats.)  The meat is rich, buttery, and well-seasoned.  No gustatory surprise here, but the execution is spot on.\n\nFinally, my friend\'s fears of going home hungry are allayed.\n\nBefore dessert, the server half-heartedly attempts to up-sell us a pricey flight of whiskeys.  I\'m not that impressed with the booze on offer, so we stick to plain dessert.  Three different ones come to the table: a berry tart with basil ice cream, crepes with a sweet creamy filling, and an orange cake with whipped cream.  The basil ice cream tastes like pesto and doesn\'t match the tart at all.  The orange cake is solid.  The crepes are predictable, but fine.\n\nOverall, the food was quite good, though nothing was so memorable that I imagine talking about it later.  Moreover, again and again, our experience was marred by poor service.  For all the buzz about Craigie, I wanted better.']
['Loved it!!! The food is adventurous and perfectly executed.  Desserts need some work.  The service impeccable.']
['Top knotch!\n\n-Excellent, attentive, educated, polite service.\n-Lovely ambiance without being too stuffy or too trendy.\n-Carefully prepared dishes for amuse bouche to dessert.\n-Tasty cocktails and extensive wine list. Would def go back to just sit at the bar and have cocktails.\n-The 4 course meal blew my mind but was probably a little too much. Will prob just get an appetizer or side (bone marrow) and a main course next time (pork three ways was delish).\n- Desserts are fabulous. Loved the peanut and banana one.\n\nAll in all - such a lovely, special treat for a special occasion.']
['Four words, quickly becoming my favorite four in the English Language: Fried. In. Duck. Fat.\nYes yes, I know. Not healthy. Does it help that the fried items involved were Brussel Sprouts? Because, it must be said, they were beyond delicious. They were also just the after-thought add-on to the amazing 4-course meal I had with my grandmother a few weeks ago. \n\nI really can\'t say enough good things about Craigie. I\'m a big foodie and work in the service industry and my grandmother is, well, just really really difficult to please.  We came out of that meal fat, happy, and the perfect level of drunk. Everything we had was really creative and fresh, with eat first bite usually followed by "omg, you gotta try this!" The waiter was very nice and attentive and paired our two meals with a great bottle of wine. The menu changes often enough that I don\'t know if the pork 3-ways or the scallops poached in oil and curry are even offered anymore, but if they are, you really have to try them.\n\nI only have one very minor criticism, but it\'s nothing that would ever stop me from going again, or even take it down to a 4-star review:. If you make a reservation, request to sit on the perimeter of the room, or at least not in the very middle. The rest of the dining room seemed so cute and cozy, but we were smack in the center. It gave a great view of the open kitchen (which i personally love), but also felt a little like we were just kind of an island in a very busy ocean. Wine helps that, however.']
["After having to wait for over half an hour past our reservation time to even sit at our table, we still had to deal with the exceptionally slow waiter. Over an hour after our original booking, we finally got to put our drink order in. Now, I realize it seems totally acceptable these days to put up with such behavior in highly-hyped 'in' places, but as good as the food was, and it was delicious, it takes away from the dining experience to have such inattentive service at this caliber restaurant. So I am reluctant to recommend it for that reason. If you must go, I will say the food was highly enjoyable, the Pork Three Ways, distinctive. Wine list had a good selection. So while the food was highly satisfying, the service needs work. Try it out on a night you have tons of time to kill."]
["This place was a little intimidating at first but they do a good job at making you feel at home, and they take their culinary creations seriously.   The staff here just oozes enthusiasm.    Prices were a little intimidating on a student/post grad budget but probably reflects the amount of effort and preparation that goes into the food. \n\nIt's worth going at least once, though (as a student...)."]
['Went to try out Chef\'s Whim at 9pm, and my date and I both got the 6 course meal and, as older yelp reviews recommended to us, asked to be seated at the chef\'s table, which is the bar facing the kitchen immediately to the left of the main doors. There are 4 seats there. We had fun watching the kitchen, but had we been seated elsewhere I don\'t think we would\'ve enjoyed the meal too much less. \n\nWe both got the non-vegetarian 6 course Chef\'s Whim, which was a single bite, a charcuterie plate, a salad, a fish dish, a meat dish, a palate cleansing sorbet, and a dessert. The single bite was a sliver of scallop and sauce, and was delicious. The salad was endive, cured duck breast, toasted (or roasted?) hazelnuts, and a very tasty cheese. The fish was Scottish salmon over rock shrimp, mussels, and a few bits of lobster in a celery puree sauce and another sauce. The meat was veal wrapped in bacon with (sorry, it was last night, and rather late) several small vegetables. The palate cleanser was lemon-mint and vanilla and had some seeds along with the sorbet. We were given 2 different desserts - their  Milk Chocolate Mole Panna Cotta and Vanilla Mascarpone Mousse (I think - the second could\'ve been something else.) I got a mocktail (which I didn\'t see listed on the menu) that was tasty enough when I told her what flavors I liked, and he got one of the specialty cocktails.\n\nThe single bite was delicious. They then brought a basket of rolls, which we partook of. The rolls weren\'t terribly special, but I\'d read reviews about people not thinking there was enough food in the Chef\'s Whim. We were both full at the end of the meal, so I somewhat regretted the rolls. I didn\'t mention what the charcuterie was, because I generally don\'t like sausage and the effect was lost on me, as was the description of what the main piece of meat was. My date enjoyed it. The salad underwhelmed me. He enjoyed the bites he took of everything together, and I particularly liked the bites that had toasted hazelnuts, but it didn\'t seem possible to get them in every bite and the other flavors didn\'t work well enough for me without the hazelnuts. The fish was delightful, all around. Very tasty, everything tasted well together or even if taken in bites of only bits. The meat course was divine. The palate cleanser existed, and I think that\'s about all that can be said about it. On the other hand: my mocktail was already doing a fairly good job of palate cleansing, so maybe that\'s my bias? It was a bit grittier of sorbet than I wanted it to be. The desserts were both tasty in their own ways. \n\nThere was a couple seated next to us that ordered the 4 course Chef\'s Whim. They received the same single bite, charcuterie, and dessert as we did. They may have also gotten the salad? They definitely didn\'t get the same meat course and didn\'t get the fish course at all. They may or may not have gotten the palate cleanser, depending on presence of the salad? So: I thought it was interesting that the 4 course did, in fact, have a different set of food than the 6 course, though that may not always be the case (this is the only time I\'ve been.) \n\nOn the experience: It was fun to try. My date said he especially enjoyed not having to make choices, and just waiting for people to bring him food, though it wasn\'t as much of a draw for me, in the end.  If it were standard for me to lay out that kind of money per person I might try it again sometime.The food didn\'t wow either of us enough (even though he did say he had enjoyed all of the courses, and I had very much enjoyed a few of the courses and had just moderately "not gotten" a couple) nor the experience knock our socks off enough to be worth it in the "special occasion" type price range, since I feel like I\'ve had better experiences at other restaurants for similar or better prices. I would put this on a list of "fun things to try if you\'ve lived in Boston for a few years and have the money to throw at it", but not a "must do if you\'re visiting the city and looking for the best food experience ever." My opinion my also be colored by the fact that a 9 pm dinner is rather late in the day for me. I think the couple next to us almost caught up to us time-wise, but not quite. We arrived and were seated a few minutes before 9 and left the building around 10-15 minutes before 11.']
["Best meal of my Boston life thus far. \n\nThe food was incredible and the people were absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend took me for my birthday dinner and we did the 10 course tasting--quite possibly the best birthday present ever. They were super respectful of our respective food allergies and even had a happy birthday card waiting on the table when we arrived.\n\nAs my birthday was ages ago and I'm just now catching up on all of my reviews, I won't write as much as I normally do. In a nutshell, Craigie is the best of fine dining in an unpretentious, friendly atmosphere. Everyone is happily milling about with wonderful, artfully presented food and from the moment you walk in you feel like part of the family. The 10 course tasting was exquisite. There's really no other word to sum up the meal. Their special cocktails are also quite tasty...I can't remember for the life of me what I had but it was something like a Lost In Translation. Just lovely. \n\nService was amazing, presentations were beautiful and the food was, as I said, exquisite. Thank you, Craigie, for giving me an absolutely amazing birthday dinner. Hopefully, once I save up some money, I'll be back soon."]
['The best restaurant in America.\n\nthe tasting menu is inventive and delicious (i have had it twice), but too much.  even the portions of each taste are too much.\n\nLast night i went for the fourth time this year, and the potage with grilled cheese was amazing (wish for more of the grilled cheese), followed by the ragout of wild mushrooms with eggs also amazing.\n\nwe love the food so much but want to savor each taste, so combined a few small plates and one main. Very hard to choose.\n\nThe chef oversees all of the food; he and his staff truly care about your experience.  They have opinions (our waiter recommended a very fine and unusual red wine from Austria--a perfect complement for our meal, and was surprisingly reasonable.)\n\ngo for any occasion, but most importantly, go for the food.']
["By far the best meal we've had in the Boston area in a long time. From the wait staff, to the environment, to the food, to the drinks, the place was top of its game. We had a hightop table across from the kitchen were we could see all the action and everything that was plated made us want to order it. We had the tasting menu and the favors got bigger and bolder as we moved through the meal. I also need to call out the cocktails as they made the night. We had a cocktail flight which meant we were able to sample 4 cocktails along with our meal. I would strongly reco you try this as it was the perfect way to try drinks you might not order yourself!\n\nFantastic night!!!"]
['Went here for brunch on Mother\'s day (yikes!). Yes, I have a tendency to pick the most inconvenient times to go to a nice restaurant. Anyway, the only options were prixe fixe. So choose from 3 options each for starter entree and desert - bc don\'t we always need a desert after breakfast?  I got fruit salad, "lox" (ok, not really it was a variety of smoked/pickled fish) and bagel, and fruit crumble for desert. And I\'ll be honest, I was not blown away. Although I did try a friend\'s homemade donut, and it was glorious! That being said, for the food I got I thought the price was a little steep- I think it was $60 for the prixe fixe.\n\nIt was insanely busy that day, and I don\'t eat meat (except fish) so, for me, there weren\'t many choices. So I will give Craigie another chance one day. But NOT mother\'s/valentine\'s or even flag day!']
["Decided to try the famous Craigie burger for Sunday brunch and found it to be almost good enough to justify the $18 price tag.  Service was awkward (our waiter obviously just left a job at Applebee's because he kept trying to up-sell donuts and coffee drinks, which seemed kitschy and unnecessary).  I keep wanting Craigie to be a Boston equivalent to Zuni in San Francisco but this visit quashed any shot at the title."]
["Craigie on Main was delicious. I don't know if there is anything more I can add to the already raving reviews of this place. \n\nMy boyfriend and I came here on a Friday night at 5:30 so the place wasn't super crowded. We started with some oysters for appetizers, I got the 3-way Pork and my boyfriend got the Ribeye for dinner. Everything was fresh/tender and amazingly good. I usually dislike drinking alcohol, but I loved the Savannah cocktail they made. The service was prompt and incredibly attentive, the chef came out at the end to chat briefly with us about what we liked/disliked. A very wonderful evening before the BSO concert.\n\nOf course you pay for the good food/service. I think it is a little pricey, our bill came out to be $120 before tip. So it is something to indulge in infrequently. I think they have a Chef's Whim on Sunday night that is a pretty good deal though."]
['I...wow, uh...yeah, ok. I don\'t know where to start with this. For the second year in a row, we\'ve celebrated our anniversary here. We went for the 6 course chef\'s tasting menu both times. And have been floored both times.\n\nThe way Craigie works with food is experimental and amazing. If you go, do not fret about having the chef choose everything for you. Just put your little palette in Chef Maw\'s hands and let him delight you. You\'ll wind up trying something new and unexpected and you\'ll love it all. \n\nUpon making our reservation, we let the hostess know Brendan has a gluten allergy and that we wanted the tasting menu. Craigie was beyond accommodating. Here is what we had:\n- Three bites on one plate: squid noodles in an Asian vinaigrette; house smoke waloo; salmon rillette with caviar and micro-greens.\n- Tuna sashimi with avocado and sugared lemon\n- Wild Australian Travalo (I tried Googling this fish, but couldn\'t find it) cooked in chicken schmaltz (fat) with a roe and horseradish mayonnaise. And on top of all that, chicken schmaltz powder which feels like confectioner sugar but tastes like the best part of the chicken. This fish was caught that morning and you could still taste the seawater.\n- Soft-shell crab tempura over pureed stinging nettles and white beans. For such a exquisite dish, it was recommended that we just use our hands. It was Brendan\'s first time having soft-shell crab and now he loves it. Also, stinging nettles!\n- Wild mushroom ragout with blood sausage and poached farm fresh egg. I normally do not like wet eggs. But this year, and last (served with farrow), I have thoroughly enjoyed this egg. Don\'t ask me why.\n- Veal two ways: sweetbread; veal loin wrapped in pork fat over greens. This is one of those times when you just gotta eat what you\'re given and ask questions later (recommended for any tasting menu). I enjoyed the taste of this and that may not have happened had I known what sweetbreads were.\n- Mango sorbet with fennel for me; blackberry sorbet with candied kumquat for Brendan.\n- Sour milk panna cotta with housemade granola and brown sugar powder (made via the same process they use to make the chicken schmaltz powder). I LOVED this dessert. I could not get over the creaminess of the panna cotta. Brendan had rice pudding with pina colada sorbet.\n- (The thickest) hot chocolate (I have ever had) flavored with Ancho (?) chili.\n\nWhen it comes to cocktails here, you have to order an Old Cuban, a refreshing rum drink with mint. Since this was our anniversary (and we had gift cards), we also decided to get a bottle of wine. The wine list is extensive, so I\'d recommend asking the server (and feel free to say that you have a budget. They can work with that info!). They even removed the label from the bottle and set it on a postcard so we could remember our night.\n\nCraigie is on my list of "must haves." It is more than worth saving all your change and cashing it in to truly enjoy your visit here.']
['My tour of Boston area restaurants continued with Craigie on Main. I had a fabulous dinner here tonight with my wife and parents; everybody had a great time and immensely enjoyed the food and service. Craigie on Main features creative, fresh upscale cuisine but in a relaxed, casual environment. Our server, Holly was fantastic and our evening began with a round of cocktails. Several of the drinks on the cocktail menu are concoctions created in house and I opted for one of these which consisted of gin, sherry, an herb, lime and an egg (Drop You Gun #2 was the name). They also feature an extensive list of French and European wines as well as a handful of beers on tap, mostly local craft beers. \n\nCraigie on Main really has a fun menu. You have the option of a chef tasting menu (two sizes of courses to choose from, six or ten, but entire table must participate) or an a la carte menu where all foods of each of the three courses are priced the same. We opted for a la carte and my father and I shared the much heralded crispy fried pig tails and the octopus. The pig tails were exciting to eat and did not taste at all what I was expecting; it had the general flavor and texture of a sweet Chinese dish with fried pork. The octopus was amazing; very tender and flavorful and well prepared; every last morsel was consumed. For my main I went with the Vermont pork three ways (as alas, I was not successful talking any of my table mates into sharing the pig face for two, despite my attempts to have Holly try and help sell this idea to one of my family members). Nevertheless I was very pleased with my dish. The pork three ways features pork confit, pork belly and a pork rib - all were good, though my only complaint was it was a bit over salted for my taste. Serving sizes for the all the courses were rather generous. \n\nHolly took great care of us all evening and while she was our principle server, they have a team approach and several other servers made sure we were always being looked after. Napkins were refolded during bathroom trips and water glasses always kept full. The pace of the meal was quite leisurely, which for us was a plus, but if you are looking for a fast dinner this might not be the best venue for you. The tables are set somewhat close together, but there are excellent acoustics and we noticed that despite a full house, it was not loud at all and was very easy to converse. \n\nThe best dish of the evening was the side of bone marrow that the table shared. This dish has a striking presentation; two large pieces of split cow femur set in the center of the table served with bread; you scoop the tender marrow onto the bread and wow was it good! I was pretty tempted to pick up the stripped bone and suck out the last few bits! Do not be scared to order this dish if you have not tried marrow before; while it sounds and looks a bit intimidating if you are into more plain foods, it does not taste challenging at all, just lots of great taste, texture and flavor. \n\nAll four of us settled on a different dessert. My wife went with the cheese plate (featuring three cheeses from Formaggio, each with a different accompaniment). I went with the trio of house made sorbets (the rum sorbet was my favorite). Dad had the affogato and mom went with a poached peaches with goat cheese. Each of us enjoyed the final course. When the check was delivered it came with one last tasty treat; some chocolate covered nut clusters that were also excellent. All in all an outstanding dinner and I will definitely be back (and if you are willing to share the pig face with me, message me and maybe we will go together)!']
["After placing Craigie on my short list after stopping by for a cocktail a few months ago and gazing into the open kitchen, we were not disappointed in our choice to go back for a birthday dinner last week.\n\nOur waitress and bartender were almost as excited as the food as we were. We don't often have the opportunity for fine dining in our budget, and were impressed by how many staff seamlessly attended to every part of our meal.\n\nMy meal was best described as a 'festival of meat', with the mixed charcuterie plate (which was served with so many accoutrements that I ordered more bread just to try different combinations) to the 'small' (huge) side dish of bone marrow, to my pork three ways, which I could barely eat for being so full but still enjoyed every bite.\n\nWe didn't do dessert, electing to go to Toscanini's which is right down the street.\n\nThank you Tony and staff for a wonderful experience- we will be back. We saw a couple get their burgers while waiting at the bar- that's our next order!"]
['To borrow a phrase from Anthony Bourdain, this place is one of the "Stations of the Cross" on the Boston culinary circuit. The food presides here, and the servers (foodies all) favor you with sound counsel when ordering and knowing winks when your plates arrive. You will ogle and salivate, but not at/over your fellow diners -- at Craigie, it\'s definitely more about the board than the room.\n\nFor me, the fare runs the short gamut from pants-creamingly-good (skate wing, pork belly) to just-south-of-nirvana (the bone marrow). I partook of the winter tasting menu and I was delighted throughout. Why is roasted bone marrow so good? I have no idea. But at Craigie it\'s hematopoetic heaven.\n\nThere are many excellent and meticulously wrought descriptions of the offerings at Craigie on this site so I won\'t waste your time with those. Suffice it to say that Craigie is the uber and the utter in Boston dining, and you should try it.']
["We went to Craigie on Main for my graduation dinner. Initially, we were seated in the dining room, but after learning that the famous Craigie burger could only be ordered in the bar room (kind of a weird, nitpicky restriction, but maybe burger is bar food?), we asked if there were any available tables in the bar room, and there was - so we moved to a table there.\n\nThe service was wonderful - attentive, but not overly attentive. Our waiter was very gracious and attended to all the details of our meals. He also gave us great recommendations when we asked what the most popular/delicious dishes were.\n\nIf you are in the camp that believes that a restaurant's bread and butter are reflective of the quality of a restaurant's food (as I am), then Craigie on Main will not let you down. Craigie on Main serves a basket of bread pulled from a pain d'epi. The crust is crisp but not brittle, and the insides reveal a delightful crumb, with large air holes. Sour, soft, and slightly chewy, the bread is served with a high-quality, rich butter, the kind of sweet European butter that is rarely matched in America.\n\nWe started out with:\n(1) Fried Pig's Tails - the most popular first course. Met our expectations - crispy, sweet and salty. Tony Maws is the master of the pig, as the logo of the restaurant suggests.\n(2) Octopus - most succulent octopus flesh I've ever tasted. Very impressive.\n(3) Ragout of boudin noir with farm fresh egg - boudin noir is black pudding. The ragout was a overly salty (a pattern I found with several of their dishes), but the farm fresh egg was cooked perfectly. I wish the incorporation of the fiddlehead ferns was more apparent, as the showcasing of that vegetable could have enhanced the meal even more. Plating was quite beautiful though.\n(4) Bone Marrow (side order) - It's hard to be disappointed by bone marrow, especially with the thick slabs of crispy toast and large grains of sea salt that were served alongside, but in my opinion, the fatty creaminess of marrow is even more delicious when balanced out by the tang of a parsley/caper/garlic salad.\n\nOur main dishes were:\n(1) Craigie on Main Burger - the medium-rare burger was perfectly cooked, with a touch of red at the center - so flavorful, juicy, and thick. More meat and less bun, which is how burgers should be served. We went without bacon, but that would have been a nice addition. This bougie burger is made more bougie by the accompaniments: housemade ketchup, celery root sauerkraut, and housemade pickles - but who can complain? Also served with fries that are tasty but not stellar.\n(2) Pork three ways - Some Asian influences going on here. Meat was fall-off-the-bones tender. No complaints here.\n(3) Glacee of Early Spring Vegetables - a mix of glaceed vegetables, including fiddlehead ferns, purple cauliflower, and turnips. This was actually a bit heavier than I would have liked, especially since such fresh vegetables are so beautiful, fresh, and tasty on their own that they seem weighed down by the excess oil. I love that the plating of the smoky, sweet mushrooms was a play on ribs/marrow. The grain pilaf was a nice mix of quinoa, wild rice, and farro, but I thought that the glaze that held them together was a bit thick and syrupy.\n(4) Halibut with crab on top - a great pairing. The halibut was tender and flaky, which is impressive, given that halibut is usually a tougher fish.\n\nDessert:\n(1) We all split the Banana Millefeuille (we went to Toscanini's afterwards - I would highly suggest doing the same! The best ice cream in all of Cambridge) - which was such a delightful dessert. The caramelized banana and crunchy caramel pieces are apt bitter accents to the moist (but not cloyingly sweet) banana cake - which is fluffy and light. A few dabs of foamed cream are delicious as well.\n\nThe cooking and service are superb here. The dishes were all salty, oily, and a bit on the heavier side, but Tony Maws has certainly perfected the art of cooking meat, and the care with which he treats food is readily apparent. Highly recommended, especially for a special occasion meal."]
["Craigie on Main never fails to disappoint as an excellent splurge.\n\nWhile I haven't gotten the chance or money to eat in their main dining room since they moved, I've eaten at their bar several times, and loved it each time. If you're going to try to eat at the bar, I recommend getting there early, and bringing no more than 1 friend with you. It gets busy and people linger, being as good as it is.\n\nTheir burger is by far the best in Boston. They will tell you how they generally cook it, and you should just agree. I don't even like ground beef and find just thinking about this burger is craving-inducing. Chef Maws is also a master of the odd meats - his terrines are out of this world and definitely enough to share between at least 2 people. Even dishes like pigs tails, which make the least squeamish cringe, are done in a way a vegetarian could appreciate.\n\nThe cocktails, like the food, are well thought out and well executed. You can go in and ask Tom for something refreshing or something with flowers and he will make the best drink you've had in years. They make their own sour mix and only use the freshest ingredients.\n\nThe service, though, is really what makes this worth five stars. It never fails that they include something for free, whether they think we didn't enjoy something enough (just because we didn't finish it) and take it off the check, or find a Rhubarb-Hibiscus foam in the kitchen for us, there's always something above and beyond. Going in later in the evening, they once turned us away with free drink coupons because the wait was going to be too long. The waitstaff is the definition of attentive, the bar tenders are friendly, and the hostesses keep you constantly up to date on your status while you wait.\n\nThis should definitely be considered the next time you want to be spoiled for an evening, and ruined forever."]
['We had a wonderful birthday celebration here - interesting menu - some unusual offerings - great desserts - delicious food -  excellent service - a little loud - a bar in the middle of the restaurant - pricey.']
["We came for brunch and I got their hash, which was amazingly flavored, served with really good wheat toast (the fact that I'm raving about the toast says something, it's toast!). Another friend got their pancakes and it was delicious! I ordered a side of the pork belly, and it was perfection. Dessert was the coffee ice cream profiteroles. I would have licked up the plate if no one were looking."]
['I have lost track of how many times my husband and I have dined at Craigie on Main.  According to Facebook, we have checked in 10 times this year. Craigie on Main has to be one of the best restaurant in Boston.  My husband says, it is a special occasion so Craigie on Main it is!  Brunch... sure!  Why not Craigie.  No matter what the occasion, one cannot go wrong eating at this establishment.    \n\n"Someone got the last pig\'s head?" I said the last time we dined.  Then Chef\'s Tasting it will be.  The food has been consistent.  My husband and I have never had a bad meal there.  We enjoyed every meal whether we are sitting at the bar or the high tables.']
["It doesn't get any better.\n\nFour of us enjoyed a terrific restaurant experience. Drinks, food and service are all five star. Not much more needs to be said."]
["Went on Saturday night for a friend's birthday dinner-cozy, inviting, (busy!) atmosphere......love the open kitchen! The pig's tails appetizer were deliciously flavored, crunchy and tender and the octupus was delish as well. Unfortunately, they were out of the hamburger by our reservation time-my husband was bummed out, so he opted for the ribeye-quite tender and tasty, although I wasn't overly fond of the marinade-a little too sweet for my taste. My entree, cod, was way fresh and very enjoyable. The duck fat brussel sprouts were YUMMY! Our desserts were ok, but not fabulous. Our service, too, was just ok-friendly and pleasant, but not as effecient as I anticipated. \nOur experience was enjoyable, but disappointingly not what I expected after reading all the excellent reviews. I would suggest going on a week night when it might not be as busy."]
['This place is the best of all. The decor is just amazing, very cozy u can have food becoming art in front of your eyes. The chef observes cautious every dish that leaves the kitchen before it comes to your table. The food is indescribable. Such a increhible combinations of contemporary tastes. A must do in Boston!!!!']
["Best meal I've ever had and I'm a tough critic.  The pig tails will change your life."]
["Cragie is a great place for the food snob. I however wasn't impressed.\nPros:\n- Food was Interesting. Craigie prides itself in it's concepts. It creates plates and mixes that I would have never thought of but somehow work. Definitively not your mama's meatloaf... \n- Waiting staff is friendly and knowledgeable. Considering the list of questions and back and forth changes we put the guy through, he managed them well and courteously. \n- The Space. The decor was excellent and made you want to ask them were they got this and that...\nCons:\n- Food was Interesting. Yes, same as the pro... Sometimes I just want my mama's meatloaf darn it! And this is not the place to look for it... Not to mention some of the plates tasted a bit too greasy or salty for my liking (or for the price paid for them).\n- The wait, Yes same as the pro again... The waiters were stellar, the wait? Not so much... we waited close to an hour for our food. I expect more (meaning less waiting) from a place of this caliber.\n- The Space (you get the theme)... Even though it was greatly decorated it felt cramped. Not to mention, if you're close to the kitchen, expect to repeat the odorous experience, over and over again, courtesy of your clothes...\nNet, good to experience once (if only to brag about it with friends) ;-). Will give it another try during Sunday Brunch, which I hear is a must do..."]
['Craigie on Main is one of the places I have wanted to try for a really long time. Then again, part of me never even wanted to step food inside. After all the good things I had heard over the years, I had a feeling I was going to fall in love and always need to go back for more.\n\nBone marrow, pigs tails, burger, wine selection - all fantastic. Our server was excellent and not pushy at all. Nicest part might have been the complimentary dessert sent over since we were celebrating a birthday. Everything was so nice and being there made me very happy.\n\nAnd now, of course, I need to go back for more.']
['Just came back from a Mother\'s Day meal with my wife. Lets start with a quick listing of the items we ordered.\n\nAppetizers:\n\nGrilled Spanish Octopus $18\ncipollini onions, fresh hearts of palm, chorizo sauce\n\nAssiette of Three Terrines: Quatre Foies, Fromage de Tete, Lamb Rillettes  $15\ntraditional accompaniments\n\nSalad of Hiramasa Sashimi $17\npine nut-mango salsa, avocado, whitefish roe, shiso\n\nEntrees:\n\nOrganic Hangar Steak à la Poêle $36\nbone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice, walnut-foie gras purée\n\nGrilled Vermont Organic Pork Belly two ways $36\nwalnut-foies gras purée, crispy shallots\n\nWine:\n\n2003 Rosso di Maremma, Tuscany $109\nMassa Vecchia\n\nDessert:\n\nMarket Fruits Crisp $10\nchampagne mango and rhubarb, macadamia nut topping, tarragon ice cream*\n\nTotal tab without tips was around $260.\n\nBy Boston standards, the food was above average.  The ingredients were first rate, execution and technique above average, while the level of imagination with the ingredients was merely average.   With regards to the wine list, I thought it was narrow, limiting and not particularly well edited.  The entire list was devoid of any fine US wines.  It was heavily Franco centric with a smattering of Italian vintages.  \n\nOf the three appetizers, the best of the lot was the Salad of Hiramasa Sashimi.  The sashimi was well sliced and nicely paired with pine nut-mango salsa and avocado serves at the perfect  temparture.  At restaurants, you very often get sashimi that is ice cold because it was just taken out of the freezer. The grilled octopus was a bit under seasoned, but otherwise it was nicely grilled without being rubbery.  The charcuterie plate was just ok... nothing exceptional.\n\nThe hanger steak was well marinated and grilled to perfection, but the smokey marinade completed obliterated the accompaniment of bone marrow, smoked beef tongue, shiitake mushrooms, Camargue red rice, and walnut-foie gras purée.  It was a shame.  My wife had the pork and it was again very good, but not memorable.\n\nThe dessert was a real disappointment.  The fruit crisp was luke warm with the filling of champagne mango and rhubarb indistinguishable from each other.  A fine dinning restaurant should not serve such a "peasant" desert at $10.  Its time that this place invest in a real pastry chef.\n\nLastly, the wine list needs some attention as discussed earlier.  Again with the price points of the entrees, a knowledgeable sommelier would be helpful.\n\nSo you ask why it is only three stars if its above average.  Because the rating are based upon food not just in Boston, but around the world.  The rub here is that the price point at Craigie is pretty much at the top end of the Boston market and there are a number of places that offer a superior overall experience.  They include Clio, Dante, Carmen and 51 Lincoln.\n\nLooks like Maws has a few more things to learn from Oringer.\n\nThis will not be a place we will frequent.']
['This place is off the hook.\n\nAmazing, crisply prepared cocktails at the bar. Friendly, knowledgeable, efficient staff throughout the meal. The freshest local proteins and veges, prepared with care and dished up with a twist.\n\nI had the prix fixe featuring a trout amuse bouche, a sashimi course that was out of this world, an organic pork dish prepared 2 different ways, and some kind of brilliant gingerbread thing for dessert.\n\nOne of the greats in Boston, a really special meal.']
['Amazing! Outstanding local burger (grass-fed, but the meat melts in your mouth and is perfectly cooked), great libations, great atmosphere. Everyone in Boston should come here for the burger! \n\nLoved it.']
["After starving ourselves for most of the day, we celebrated a birthday here and got the six course tasting menu, and sat at the chef's table...it was delicious.  Our pleasant and helpful server guided us to the perfect bottle of wine that really opened up nicely about 10-15 minutes after being opened.  \n\nThe chef's table was awesome.  You sit at a granite counter top and get a full view of all the sights, sounds, and smells of a well organized and efficiently ran kitchen.  I've never worked in a restaurant before, so I was viewing it as an outsider, watching several moving parts (and bodies) work together to assemble each diner's meal.  Watching the kitchen staff work was like listening to a complex symphony play, just beautiful.\n\nWe got six wonderful courses, each just as appetizing a beautiful as its predecessor, with the final course hand delivered by the Chef himself.  \n\nThis tiny restaurant serves up immaculately plated and tasty courses.  The meal was pricey, but worth it for special occasions.  Try the Sunday Brunch or Sunday night meal chef's whim meal options for a cheaper, but likely equally tasty, meal.\n\nFor those griping about the lack of fanfare for a birthday, what do you want?  A Mariachi band?  They know how to keep it classy.  You get a personalized card and a candle, and we got some extra desserts.  \n\nThis place was expensive, no doubt about that, but a fun experience."]
['First off, I am sure if you get one of the tasting menu\'s, don\'t sit in the bar area and are not on a mission for their burger only, that this place is a foodies dream. \nCame last night solely for the burger and so the wife could also sample some of the goodness. I have to agree with some other reviewers who left feeling that they paid a lot more than what they actually ate and enjoyed. Not to mention that our food came out came out about 5 min after ordering. \nThe cocktails were great, I had the Northern Lights and my wife had a drink very similar to the Old Cuban at Eastern Standard except with St Germain. I ordered the burger and added bacon. Wife ordered the Octopus app and brussel sprouts cooked in duckfat as a side. \nMaybe it was just the burger hype that left me feeling let down, but I must say I was a bit underwhelmed. The meat itself was amazing. tasty, juicy and cooked to perfection medium rare as they suggest. The big picture was just not "life changing" as our waitress had asked me following a few bites...Life changing is the Suribacha burger at Swagger in KC! The bun was too small for the burger and with all the juices flowing, things became very soggy, very quickly. The bacon was also not all that cooked which was a turn off. For $21 and all the hype, I definitely expected more. My wife\'s octupus was good, but not $17 good and the brussel sprouts were also very good. The bar menu leaves you with very limited choices now since they combined it with the regular menu and now all apps are $17 and ala carte entrees $27.  Our waitress was probably the best part of our meal, very friendly, knowledgable and willing to help lend a hand at the end of the meal when we asked for some recommendation for a nightcap elsewhere. In summary, the burger was definitely underwhelming and it could just have been because of all the hype leading up to it. Definitely, not a $100 meal based on what we ordered and drank. I will definitely be going back, but only on a special occasion where I am willing to spend $200+ and go for the full tasting experience.  Thanks Tony.\nOh and I forgot to mention,  the housemade ketchup being a spicy food fan, was amazing and it seems they made a big improvement on the fries!']
['I knew this place was going to be good, but really, I had no idea.  Arrived at 6pm on a Wednesday with no chance at a table without a reservation (people like good food I guess - who knew?), but we snagged the corner seats and the bar which were some of the most comfortable bar seats I\'ve ever experienced (I hate bar seats...I\'m short).\n\nTom, the head of the bar, is a very nice guy!  It may have helped that my friend I was with was buddy buddy with him, but he knew what he was doing and was very friendly and knowledgeable, even with the patrons around us.  \n\nThey take care of you here - gourmet service all the way, even at the bar.  We decided to do the $75 prix fixe menu, because it seemed that everything we wanted was on there anyways.  They have a different and seemingly fantastic bar menu as well - I wish I could have eaten 3 dinners at once.  For the Amuse Bouche course I can\'t remember what my friend had, but I had pork belly and oh.  my.  god.  It was like the best tastes of prosciutto and bacon in one, mixed with some shaved crispy pear. Gah.  I commented to my friend that I don\'t understand why the most delicious food has to sound so unappealing.  Pork belly?  Really?  Yes.  Really.  F\'in get it. (and that was just two bites of food!)\n\nFor the App course we each got the asparagus soup with pork jowl croutons (again...why?).  I think it takes some serious skill to do a soup exceedingly well and Tony Maws, my friends, has some serious skizills.  And those croutons?  WTF?!  Delicious little nuggets of salty heaven.\n\nThe entree choice was easy - my friend got Lamb 3 ways, and I got the dayboat scallops.  Good GOD those scallops were good.  If you like seafood, and seafood done well, I highly recommend them.  I\'m a cute-atarian (don\'t eat cute things - sure, go ahead and laugh), so I don\'t "eat" lamb persay, but I tried my friend\'s and wow.  Kinda makes me want to eat cute sheepies on a regular basis.\n\nWe were given a palette cleanser before dessert of infused panna cotta (mine with rooibos, his with jasmine) and this alcoholic drink called milk punch I think?  I don\'t think that\'s exactly right, but it was clear and amazingly interesting.  I\'d never even dreamed of either dish and they were really inventive and a great experience.\n\nDessert was a peanut butter parfait for me (pb mousse between two rectangular cookie-biscuits with some kind of grape foam on top) and an Olive Oil and Tazzo chocolate mousse for my friend.  Mine was more interesting than awesome (though it was pretty good), and his was drool-inducing.\n\nSo - long story short (too late) - it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience with excellent food in a fun atmosphere that was upscale and casual at the same time.  When you\'ve got a pretty penny to drop on a great dining experience, I highly recommend Craigie.']
["This was my first meal at COM and it was fabulous. Even though we had reservations, I specifically went earlier to sit at the bar to drink a few cocktails and take in the place. I also had been dying to try the pig's tails (on the bar menu). They were so yummy.  They had two specials, one of which was roasted bone marrow.  Even though we were set up for the tasting menu, we requested to start off with the roasted bone marrow -- it is one of my favorite things to eat. Now I grew up eating many parts of an animal so nothing was really out of my comfort zone. What was truly delightful was the preparation -- unique, creative, and yet so simple. \n\nWhile I can not really pick a favorite because everything was so delicious and different, the lamb and pork courses from the tasting menu were very memorable. Both dishes offered the featured animal prepared in multiple ways and through different parts. There was the incredible slow roasted pork belly to the deliciously creamy lamb sweetbreads. Desserts were very good and part of our tasting. I had a lovely and fragrant jasmine panna cotta. \n\nSo, deep fried pig's tail, roasted bone marrow, the six course tasting menu and some cocktails. To top it all off a fabulous service in a casually elegant space. Exceptional."]
['My wife and I each had two appetizers for dinner.  The food was good, although the prices seemed a bit high.  With tip, we spent $127 on 4 apps, 2 glasses of wine, a dessert and a pot of tea.\n\nMy complaint relates more to the vibe of the place.  It just seems like they are trying so hard to be "different" or, in their words, "fanatical about food."  This unfortunately  takes center stage.  A little bit of understatement, and less theater, would serve them well.  They should let the food speak for itself.\n\nThat goes for the wait staff as well.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about the menu, almost like a telemarketer is about the product s/he is selling.  And while I appreciate the staff\'s constant attention (at least 6 different people visited our table), it bordered on intrusive.\n\nCraigie on Main reminds us a bit of Restaurant Eve, an  excellent restaurant in Alexandria, VA where we live.  They too have a dedication to fine and fresh ingredients, and they too do not offer the standard fare of most other establishments.  \n\nBut the dining experience is entirely different.  It epitomizes understatement and sophistication.  And when you are paying $120 for a very light dinner, that can make all the difference in the world.']
['Craigie on Main\'s Chef\'s Whim menu was, hands down, the most fun I\'ve ever had dining out at a restaurant. It\'s still somewhat of a splurge, but think of it as dinner AND a show. And you can eat the show.\n\nThe 6-course menu wove through new and familiar culinary territories, from a bluefin and caviar amuse-bouche, to a venison rillette, to sweetbreads, and all the way back to a delightful spin on the peanut butter and banana sandwich. Some things I liked, some things I didn\'t, but it\'s exhilarating, going to dinner and leaving it all up to someone else. They even give you a pencil and some paper so you can write down what you were served.\n\nLove the open kitchen, love the bar (and, incidentally, the bartender), love the waitstaff with their helpful answers to all of my "um, what exactly am I eating?" inquiries. This is the best way to experience a great restaurant with an award-winning chef - on it\'s own terms, and with a discount!']
["I nearly starved to death!!! \n\nWhile I loved - and devoured (who could blame me!) - the deliciously decadent $18 burger, I almost passed out waiting 90 minutes for it. So I understand, Craigie on Main was busy, it's a new restaurant, the waitstaff is just getting their rhythm down, blah blah blah. But seriously, when have you EVER waited that long without someone coming over to explain what was going on? Our waiter was NOWHERE to be found, our water glasses empty, our mouths parched and our stomachs growling in anticipation. Was it worth it? The burger was amazing but the sides were a little too precious for me...I challenge anyone to figure out how to eat that haystack arrangement of microscopic fries!"]
['If you like the cocktails at DRINK, then you\'ll love them at Craigie on Main. They infuse their "libations" with cherry, juniper, and anise to name a few....and the results are spectacular! I would venture to say that these are the best cocktails in Boston/Cambridge hands down. \n\nAs for the food....my date and I sat at the bar and nibbled. We split the ragout appetizer with mushrooms and sausage. WOW! YUM! It can only be described as tasty x tasty x tasty x infinity. Also - and this is just my own little critique of restaurants - good bread goes along way. Craigie\'s bread bowl was great and came with a mix of different rolls - the best one being a multigrain roll that included seeds. I love seeds - so I also loved this roll.\n\nIf you\'ve been thinking about coming to Craigie - don\'t think, just do it.']
['I want to start off by saying that if i had loved every dish COM would have gotten 5 stars, everything has to be perfect, i just don\'t give out perfect scores very often.  with that said, the tasting menu was a great experience, i wish i got the 10, but i\'m glad i didn\'t because i was very full by the end.  i highly recommend the tasting menu, the experience is worth the money, let alone the good eats. \n\nBox Score: 6 course tasting menu for myself and date and a cocktail. total price $240 with tip and tax. \n\nThe meal started off with an amuse bouche of clam ceviche, squid and a fried clam.  this dish started off with a bang. the squid really hit home, there was a hint of sesame oil and the friend onions on the top gave me palate flashbacks of my childhood when my grandmother used to cook. \n\nYelp doesn\'t allow me to review each meal, so i\'ll just speak of what stood out and what didn\'t. \n\nOne of the savory dishes was the monkfish, i was delighted to finally get to try monkfish, it\'s not something you can find at the grocery store and i was surprised at its texture, somewhat like scallop as my companion so kindly noted.  everything about the dish was nice with the exception of the broth, i felt the chefs hand was a bit heavy on the salt. \n\nanother dish that stood out was the veal two ways, i was not a big fan of the braised cheeks, it was succulent and tender, but it lacked in flavor, it almost felt as if it was covered in hoisin sauce. the sweetbreads on the otherhand were fantabulous, just a bit heavy by that point in the meal. \n\nmy companion absolutely LOVED the sashimi dish, i was a big fan as well, it was clean, crisp and very refreshing. \n\nRagoût of Local Forest Mushrooms, House-Made Country Sausage, Turnips and Romanesco was also a delightful dish... it was honestly not that special until you broke the egg and let the yolk infuse the salad, once done it really tied everything together... this was one of my more favorite dishes. \n\nAlso made was the pork belly tortellini, i was a big fan of these.. it would have been an absolute perfect dish if it was cooked perfectly, i had a piece of tortellini that was not cooked enough, therefore not being very tender.  \n\ndessert was nothing to rave about, probably our least favorite part. the chocolate mousse was good, but only with the walnuts, alone it was nothing out of the ordinary imo.  the cornbread was very interesting, but i\'ve never been a big cornbread fan so it didn\'t really jump out. \n\nThe service at craigies on main was really good.  our waiter appeared to be very knowledgeable and helped us communicate with the chef to plan our tasting menu as my companion is not much of a pork eater. \n\ni asked about the 1771 and he described it very well, it was a very delightful cocktail.  \n\nthe only downside to having a tasting menu is that it\'s almost overwhelming how often waitstaff is there to clean/clear your table, which is something my companion noted to me.  \n\nall in all craigies on main is a restaurant i will return to.. maybe not anytime soon as i want to explore more restaurants in the central area. not to mention that their prices are not really "date friendly", they are more for anniversaries, b-days and special occasions.']
['25,000 calorie Pig\'s Head?\n\nIf having the pork rib and belly at Rialto for dinner on Friday and bacon for breakfast on Saturday wasn\'t enough, my wife and another couple decided to have some Pig Tails and to share the Pig\'s Head at Craigie on Sunday for dinner.  We didn\'t have reservations, but since I only live a few blocks away from this epic establishment, it wasn\'t much of a detour to see if there were any seats available at 5:30 PM.  We got lucky as there happened to be a cancellation for a 4-person table in the bar area.  I didn\'t feel super lucky though, seeing that the restaurant was two-thirds empty.  I later realized that most of the tables were allocated for later reservations and by the time our appetizers came, the house was packed!\n\nI should mention that we got the corner table in the bar area by the wall closest to the receptionist at the front door.  There was draft coming from the ceiling A/C that made the corner seat cold.  Fortunately, Craigie\'s staff brought our ladies cashmere shawls to keep them warm!  Dang!  Taking the details of customer service to another level.\n\nSince we had lunch only 4 hours ago, we only ordered the pigtails, Craigie Burger, and the Pig\'s Head.  They service Iggy\'s bread, Francese, which is their mild sourdough to be exact!  I love Iggy\'s Francese with butter, so we had about 2 baskets of that before the app came.\n\nWe started off with the pigtails.  The average person would find the sound of these to be REPULSIVE sounding and I had my doubts, but the candid-sounding assurance of the waitress, "people will fight for the last one," took care of any doubts I had.  When the pigtails arrived, they looked like wonderfully browned/crispy pieces of pork.  The closest reference I have visually is the crispy pork at Latino shops.  The pigtails had a perfect balance of marinade, meat, fat, and tendon.  To properly enjoy the pigtails, one must use a combination of fingers, nibbling, and sucking.  Absolutely messy and labor-intensive (like eating Jamaican oxtail from the bone), but absolutely delicious and rewarding when you can suck off the pigtail yumminess under the arches and cavities of the pigtail cartilage and between the joints.  Each person at our table got their hands dirty and I was so proud of us 4.\n\nAfter our yummy pigtails, our Pig Head and Craigie Burger arrived.  The pig\'s head was actually only 1/2 the head, basically 1 side of the profile, eyeball, cheeks, and teeth in tact (no tongue from what I could see of the roasted beast).  The pig\'s head was served Peking Duck Style with the thin, pancake wrapper, hoisin sauce variant, and an orange slaw.  They say it\'s a pig\'s head for 2, but I cannot see how 2 people could finish this thing.  I\'m estimating about 25,000 calories total alone for the pig\'s head.  The taste of the facial meat in the eye sockets, around the ears, cheeks, chin, nose, forehead were all of surpremo quality.  Super soft and tender like it had been slow-cooked for a day.  The challenge was to figure out how much of the fat to eat.  There was so much blubber surrounding each piece of meat.  It felt wasteful to trash the blubber give this was a $70 head, but soooooo much blubber, like at least 15,000 calories in fat alone.  As believers of eating the whole animal and not wasting any bit of the meal, we tried to eat as much of the fat and skin as possible, but to put it bluntly, my mouth and stomach was coated in pork fat about 75% of the way through the Pig Head.  My beer couldn\'t wash it down anymore.  Conclusion: don\'t try to finish all the blubber!\n\nThe Craigie Burger was the redemption burger for me.  I had a failed burger from Craigie the first time I came about 2 years ago.  Perhaps, this was during the blowup period, when the burger was wildly popular and Tony Maws was getting his meat from an inferior meat supplier instead of Hardwick feef, his typical supplier.  Speculation aside, I was ready for Rev 2.0, so I could compare it with Radius, Sel De La Terre, Garden, Porter\'s and other gourmet burgers of Boston.  I found it to be amazing and redemptive, but not as amazing as the Radius burger.  Equal portions of short rib, flap meat, and brisket with 15% suet and bone marrow to balance out the leanness of the meat formula.  Perhaps, it was the pig tails as an appetizer that spoiled it for me.  Next time, I\'ll have to have the burger as a stand alone meal to get a more accurate assessment.\n\nThe Craigie experience was phenomenal as everyone makes it out to be.  The pig\'s head could be a 5 star meal, but just don\'t try to eat all the blubber as we did!  I\'ll be back for the 10 course tasting menu next time!']
["We went for Sunday brunch to have the cheeseburgers that everyone talks about.  They lived up the hype and endsome.    Although it might sound strange if you haven't had it before, but the fried egg on top takes your taste buds to another level.    \n\nAlso tried the donut which was amazing too.  Can't wait to go back."]
['My boyfriend decided to surprise me for our Valentines dinner. We had already discussed ahead of time that we were going to celebrate sometime on the weekend, vs on actual Valentines Day since it was a Monday. Where we were going, I had no idea... until about 30 minutes before when he dropped a few hints and I figured it out. Needless to say, I was super excited because I had been meaning to try this place!\n\nJeremy K had given my boyfriend a tip before we headed out. Originally, he had asked for a quiet table, but per Jeremy K\'s recommendation of sitting at the bar/prepping area we decided to do that. What a treat! You can have a quiet table in a nice restaurant anytime... but having ring side seats for the prep of all the food was truly something special to watch. Those guys move around SO FAST, you\'d swear they were former professional athletes. Scoop some ice cream and plate it here, run and pop bread in the oven there, throw some precisely placed garnish on a dish, and send it out... you name it, they did it all.\n\nMy boyfriend and I have VERY different tastes. I can\'t eat seafood. He doesn\'t like meat (other than chicken) and doesn\'t like creams/cheese, etc. He likes red wine. I like sweet white wine. Being that it was our Valentines day celebration, and he is a true gentleman, he gave me ladies pick for the wine. I chose (with the help of our server) the 2008 Willi Schaefer Riesling. The wine was a sweet, wet, wine... just the kind I like, and for $55 it was a very nice bottle, and both of us enjoyed it.\n\nFor dinner our server was really talking up the Chef\'s tasting, and after I told her that I always missed out on those because I can\'t eat seafood, she assured me it was no problem to do one all meat. I thought this over and although I can be a picky eater... decided I was going to go for it. My boyfriend decided he was just going to have some seafood... and then we were told that when they do the Chef\'s tasting, they really ask for both of you to do them. Not to worry... they did his all seafood since he doesn\'t eat most meat! We heard our order get put in "Tasting All meat, Tasting All seafood." Fantastic.\n\nNow, I\'ll admit, I am not a foodie. I have absolutely no idea everything that I was served. I know I had some pig cheek (wasn\'t a fan of the texture of this), I had a few different types of foie gras, goat with soup around it, and all kinds of other dishes. For one of the courses, Chef Tony Maws himself came over to present it. In fact, just about every course had a different presenter. It made me realize how extensive the knowledge ALL of the staff have... not just one or two people. Now, again... I\'m not a foodie, so I apologize for not doing these dishes justice with describing what they were, what was involved, and how rich the flavors were.... because they were truly amazing. The sweetbreads were good, but knowing what they are I don\'t think I\'d opt for them again. My boyfriend loved just about every bit of seafood that crossed his plate... and we were so stuffed after this tasting... but wait... there was dessert on the way!\n\nWe were served some sorbet to cleanse our palates. This is probably the only sweet thing that my boyfriend likes to eat. We made a comment similar to this to our server and she goes "Well.... there is more dessert on the way... what kind of desserts do you like? You\'re not a big chocolate fan... okay... do you like... cake?" After a bit of back and forth she talked with the chefs. Not only did my boyfriend get an extra scoop of the sorbet, but he was also given a dessert that best fit his tastes - an apple tart of sorts.\n\nTo top it all off I had a glass of Muscat, and my boyfriend had some green tea. Our server retrieved our coats for us, and even called us a cab. Excellent customer service from the very beginning until the very end. We left very full, extremely happy, and very impressed with our early Valentines Day celebration. Other restaurants should take a lesson from Craigie on Main\'s customer experience, as few execute on it so superbly.']
["Absolutely delicious.\n\nThis is hands down the best 10 course tasting menu in the Boston area. Certainly it has topped our culinary experiences living in this area for the past few years (and we eat out a lot :)). My girlfriend pronounced our veal as the best meat she's ever eaten (and she's eaten some pretty expensive, foodie meals before).  The scallop with avocado and lovage was so yummy I wanted to lick the plate. Only one course left me a little disappointed (a pasta course that substituted as my gf does not eat pork). \n\nOxtail pastrami, hamachi collar cooked in chili sauce, smoked grilled eel, ramp kimchi couli, you name it - whether the course or just some of its ingredients - ......delish, delish, delish.\n\nOh, and the service was top-notch. Probably top 3 service I've received at any restaurant in the world."]
['Back in the not too distant future when a Bush was in the White House and a Bistrot was on Craigie Street I fell in love with French cooking. The last time I was at Craigie Street Bistrot was 2004. I only went twice in it\'s entire existence and that was a travesty of epic proportions.\n\nThen, that little enterprise by Chef Tony Maws, decided to move. Chef Tony would get his dream kitchen and Central Square would have another phenomenal notch in its gastronomic belt.\n\nHere in lies the problem. Ever since it moved I have basically been there every single Wednesday and the occasional Sunday for the Chef\'s Whim Tasting (which, conveniently has expanded to include Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays).\n\nFirst the atmosphere is a little bit French and little bit of the local neighborhood hangout. It\'s warm, like one of those snuggle, but not as pointless. \n\nThe food, is fantastic, but I don\'t know why. Oh, wait, I know why - it\'s because it\'s fresh. Wow, fresh food, what an amazing concept. And it tries to stay as local as possible. No, you can\'t have tomatoes on your burger until they are actually grown. So, Chef Tony supports local farms to help out the local economy. Take that, Recession!\n\nThe food items change because of that whole "what\'s available fresh" aspect, but I will delve into items that are fantastic...\n\nCod cheeks. Who knew fish had cheeks? Who knew that they would also taste so good? Yeah, Chef Tony did.\n\nFarro Verde. I had no idea what farro was except that it was a grain of somekind and it fed the Roman Legions. If it was good enough for Scipio, it\'s good enough for me. Sure, throw some sausage in there. Hell, put a poached egg on top. Now, that\'s what I\'m talking about. It\'s filling, but it makes you want more.\n\nPork Three Ways. I really can\'t tell you the three ways, but I like pork. Pigs are fantastic creatures and smart (have you read Animal Farm, they like Communism...wait, that actually wasn\'t good). Oh god, bacon - I could get bacon for days. I would go to war for bacon. For get Helen, I would launch a thousand ships for a pound of bacon. Anyway, the pork three ways was ecstasy.\n\nSashimi. Yeah, I\'m just getting into the raw fish scene and this was divine. Light, simple, but the favors took over your tongue like the people of Paris took over the Bastille.\n\nThe food is amazing and it tastes so damn good, but we cannot forget the libations. Tom Schlesinger, formerly of Eastern Standard, manages the small and intimate bar.  The drink list is small, but Tom, the prodigy that he is, can whip up anything your heart (liver) desires. \n\nThe wine list is tight and fantastic spanning many countries and a good portion of it being a tad eclectic so you can expand your palate from the routine sauvignon blanc and pinot noir rut people have stuck themselves into. \n\nJust go there...soak in the atmosphere...guzzle down the libations...savor every bit of the FRESH food.']
["This was my 5th time dining at Craigie St, and it will be my last. Whether I am dining at a modest place or a fine-dining restaurant, I seek value, and Craigie does not deliver anymore. \n\nI felt like a sucker.  \n\nFound the wine-by-the-glass list to be mediocre. Appetizer (trio of terrines) was microscopic and uninteresting, and there were 9 - count them 9 - accompaniments on the plate. I felt like I paid $18 for a plate of mustard. Very pretentious and ultimately, detracting.  \n\nMy entree (sausage-stuffed chicken) was cooked nicely but the whole thing was salty (and I love salt!), and the potato gallette (bland, mushy) over whole yellow potatoes (really??) was terrible. My husband's pork trio was OK, but again, a measly, bland offering for the price. The single smoked rib was very tasty. \n\nThe staff is enormous and there is a lot of coming and going - the kitchen expediter was yelling out orders constantly, and the staff dropped and broke not one but two wine glasses during our meal. \n\nI have had more creative (and generous) food for the same price at Oleana, Hungry Mother, and No. 9 Park, and have had better food for far less money at Petit Robert Bistro and even Brasserie Jo."]
['My friends in Boston have raved about Craigie on Main so it was long overdue that I finally made it.  \n\nWe got the four seats at "ringside" which overlooks the kitchen.  It\'s a neat concept, but I\'m not sure it totally worked.  The chefs were very busy all night.  We couldn\'t really interact with them and it made it hard to talk to the servers because they were in a rush to get out of the way and it was kind of loud.  I think I would\'ve preferred to sit at a table and really discuss the food since we felt timid critiquing the dishes in front of the chefs who were preparing them.\n\nI liked a lot about the meal.  The dedication to fresh ingredients is evident not only in the quality of the dishes, but also in the preparation that highlights the individual components with simple preparations.  The quality from dish to dish was very high, there\'s obviously a lot of skill in the kitchen.\n\nAll that said, I had some issues with the meal.  We ordered the full chef\'s tasting, and it was A LOT of food.  Too much really.  I\'ve had meals with 20+ courses and not felt as full as I did at Craigie.  I think this had a lot to do with the arc of the meal.  Many of the early dishes were spreads or charcuterie that they served with bread.  Even the fish was served on a bed of cous cous.  We were pretty full when the last dishes came and they were total overload.  First they served a steak and eggs dish that, though delicious, really needed some bread to sop up the creamy eggs.  Then they served four, fairly large chunks of quail with a side of bone marrow that we ordered extra (not knowing it would come at the end).  The marrow was excellent, but much too heavy to serve at the end of the meal, along with a quail entree, and naturally with a side of toast to spread it on.  I\'ve never had marrow served after the appetizers and this really was a detriment.  I was too full (of bread) to really enjoy the last couple dishes, and honestly, I wanted nothing to do with the three dessert courses they brought out.  I was basically eating out of politeness at that point (another issue with being next to the kitchen).\n\nNonetheless, the cuisine is hitting at a high level.  There were some real highlights to the meal, but if I\'m to return I\'d do the smaller chef\'s tasting and avoid any of the add-ons (though the locally foraged mushrooms were terrific).  I should also mention that I thought the meal was reasonably priced and the service was excellent.  I think there\'s a five star experience to be had, but you have to know what you\'re doing to get it.']
["Everything about this place is incredible, the food is beautifully crafted, the drinks are amazing and most importantly, the service is unlike any other I've seen in Boston. Respectful, attentive, thoughtful, you really feel special here. Highly recommend, worth every penny."]
['Craigie on Main left a very unpleasant taste and I didn\'t even dine. You should note that the Chef tasting menu ($118) is only availabe to you if your entire table orders the same. It doesn\'t matter if two of you want to order it, all members of your party need to order it. We could have come as a table of 2 and gotten this but because we were a table of 4 we couldn\'t, and no, they wouldn\'t allow us to split up into 2 tables of 2 either. Not sure what the reason is for this, we kept asking, but the only answer we got was that "THE CHEF WON\'T DO IT" so we left. Very disappointing but we didn\'t let these folks ruin our special occasion. We headed over to the next block for a fantastic meal and wonderful dining experience at  Cuchi Cuchi.']
["Absolutely impeccable service.  They bring new silverware after every course, brush the bread crumbs from your table, always check in to make sure everything is going well.  When we came to the bar at Craigie after dinner, they held our leftovers from dinner and handed them to us as we left without out ever requesting them to do so. \n\nGreat food.  I recently went for the Chef's whim 4 course, where the Chef chooses the dishes.  Each dish was unique and creative.  I thought the tastes were kind of hit or miss, for example, the main entree was a hanger steak, corned beef with mushrooms topped with a piece of fried bone marrow, sweet potato, and creamed spinach.  Admittedly, I am not a fan of mustard and the steak was drizzled with mustard oil, which ruined the taste.  The corned beef was excellent and the fried marrow was perfect.  \n\nGo to Craigie on Main, you won't be disappointed."]
["Craigie on Main was nominated for a James Award and it is very apparent why.  We went into the restaurant on a wknd and the place was packed, i was so glad i reserved a table a few weeks prior.  I absolutely love the look of the restaurant, as soon as you enter you can see the ins and outs of the kitchen, it is a neat experience.  My meal sort of started with a low, i chose the Winter Pt. oysters as my app, and they were actually too big, making it very difficult to swallow, i thought i was going to get one stuck in my throat, and they were missing the standard brininess of an oyster.  As well i didn't like the mignonette that accompanied it.  My sis had probably the best plate from our entire trip, it was the tuna sashimi with watermelon and crispy basil.  The presentation was gorgeous, with the watermelon and tuna being similar colours.  The whole dish was just very clean tasting,  the additional of the crispy basil gave it some texture, it tasted like something you would get in a Japanese restaurant.\n\n  For my next course i had the grilled octopus with chorizo, cipolinnis and hearts of palm.  The meat was of perfect texture, i love the sweetness from the onions, with the smokiness of the chorizo, it was well balanced.  My sis had the squash soup with Florida pink shrimp,  the presentation of the shrimp on skewers in a bowl of soup was beautiful.  There was actually too much soup though, since we ordered three courses, a smaller sized bowl would have been sufficient.  Lastly we tried the crispy pig tails with pickled peanuts and onion rings.  We both had never tried pig tails before and surprisingly they tasted like short ribs, they glaze was sticky and delicious.  \n\nOverall, to do craigie's right, order three course, you will not be disappointed, and just enjoy the bustling and lively surroundings."]
["What is all the fuss about people? I'm no stranger to fine dining but I'm sorry, I just don't get it. The menu, I mean. We sat and ate at the bar, and so there was the regular menu and the bar menu to choose from but I was not at all happy with the choices.  Are they trying to be as odd as possible?! Pigs tails, chicken feet, boudin noir, smelts, tongue, sea urchin, fish with collar bones, bone marrow, pork jowl, squid, sea urchin. It's showoffy, crossing the line into unappetizing. How about some fillet of... anything?! More vegetables and salads? There was no balance in the menu. \n\nI ordered a perfectly cooked, smallish and overpriced burger (given the room/rent they are likely paying) and I was not impressed. Sadly, the Vt beef was pretty tasteless. The side of sweet potato sticks were so julienned they were hard to eat. Galette, meh. Asian fish bar item was tasty and had amazing sauce but lose the bone in thing, it's unnecessary. Bread was outstanding.\n\nWe had a great Pino Nero and did not partake in the eclectic mixed drinks, but I was impressed with the offerings. It looked like an apothecary behind that bar, with the droppers of this, little bottles of that. They also have various shaped ice cubes for different drinks - right on top of the current local bar trend.\n \nI was impressed with the professional and efficient staff, at the door and especially Tom at the bar - wow, was he perfect. While we stood waiting for seats, he walked out from behind the bar to pour our wine. Throughout the meal, he was unbelievably attentive. I was so impressed.\n\nBottom line, I know the chef has accolades and it's got to be for a reason. I guess I'll return in Spring or Summer to see if things have lightened up and balanced out a bit. Maybe marrow, tongue and pigs feet will be out of season by then."]
["I finally got to Craigie on Main last night, and I was not disappointed. Having heard wonderful things from friends, I'd been looking forward to the atmosphere, and to the food.\n\nFor a late night dinner, our table split a bottle of the Japanese Mikan brew along with medium rare burgers.  I'd highly recommend the beer- great complex flavor, it's one of their new options.  On the burger side, I usually go a bit more cooked, but they managed to do medium rare well.  I would have liked a bit more of the cheddar on my burger, but now I'm just being picky.\n\nI was with a friend who frequently goes there, and the chef sent out some rooibos infused panna cotta, milk punch, and chocolate almonds after our meal. The milk punch was definitely something different, it's allowed to curdle and then filtered and infused with bourbon and black tea.  I'm not entirely sure how the process works, but it was one of the more interesting drinks I've had recently.\n\nIt was definitely worth going to, and I'm only sad I didn't go sooner."]
["Sent my parents there for their anniversary, and informed the staff it was their anniversary, arranging flowers to be delivered.  My parents were amazed at the attentive service and exquisite dishes.  Nice touches included the champagne that was brought over in honor of their anniversary (huge points) and Tony Maws wishing them happy anniversary when he came over, and really made them feel special.  And of course the dishes in the Chef's Whim were amazing. They happily described in detail what they were served.  I was certain that Craigie would be a wonderful experience for them and Craigie managed to exceed my expectations.."]
["Went to this restaurant on a Thursday night with some friends (6 of us). \n\nI got there a bit early.  Sat at the bar alone and the bartenders were very friendly.  It was obvious from the talk that they were very knowledgeable.  I ordered a sparkling wine and they told me all about it as well as let me taste it before ordering it.  Nice.\n\nFriends arrived and we sat.  We all ordered the 6 course tasting menu.  I wish I had written my review earlier, because I don't remember what everything was in detail - but I did like the food very much.  The wine waiter was knowledgeable and suggested several good bottles of wine that went very well with the meal.  I found I really liked not knowing what I was getting. \n\nBe prepared however, if you - like me - have been on a low fat diet for the last 10 years.  This is full fat.  In fact, probably full fat with some extra fat injected.  Everything has skin and... well... everything.  Nothing light or healthy about this meal.  Seriously, be prepared.  I was sick as a dog the rest of the night and all the next day.  I'm not used to to this type of food.  I think it was worth it, but nothing I'd do again for another 10 years."]
["Got the burger.  HEAVEN.  And worth the wait.\n\nSo the bar side serves the burger, as you may recall from my last post.  And I was determined to get the burger this weekend.  I got there in the heat of dinner traffic, and we put our name in for any open seat for the bar or tables.  I knew this may require a long wait, as the bar is popular, but I didn't care.  I was on a mission.  Plus, I knew the drinks were delicious and I could use a few after a busy Saturday.\n\nI had one of their delicious libations, something with sage in it.  It was just what I wanted, tart, crisp and yummy.  My friends got perfect manhattans and they raved about the homemade cherries and the almost perfect ice cubes.\n\nThe bar was crowded.  But good energy.  Kinda hot.  We finally got seated at the bar, but within minutes they came back and decided to seat us as the table.  Strangely this table was empty for about 20 minutes, but I wasn't going to complain!  I was excited to eat.\n\nFor apps, we had the oysters.  They didn't even need any dipping sauces as I think it had some sort of champagne or whatever on it.  It was really good.  Grilled octopus also on the list and I was really impressed by this.  It was like BBQ - it was cooked very well, had a lovely BBQ-like sauce and had a great texture.  But the fan favorite was the tuna sashimi.  I had it last time and had to get it again and share the wealth.   \n\nWe each had the burger, cooked to their recommendation of medium rare.  It's pink, very pink, just to prepare you.  But it was filling, decadent and just pure bliss.  Even the ketchup was something of a bit fantastic.  It was juicy, rich and so good.  Like really good.   Shoestring fries were good, but I was too stuffed to eat too many.  And we ordered the duck fat roasted brussell sprouts, which I love.\n\nNo room for dessert, but the staff treated us to a small cup of cinnamon chocolate, which was a perfect way to end the night.\n\nThe staff was really on top of it.  While we waited for our table, they were extremely attentive and checked in with us constantly.  When we sat, our waiter was really cool and the manager came up to chat as he heard I was in need of the burger.  All in all, everyone at the place was really lovely.\n\nIt was a pricey night, but worth every penny.   Amazing food, good energy, good people.\n\nNext time, I want to sit at the kitchen, I think its called the chef's table.  Watch those peeps at work!"]
["Craigie is one of those special places that I think every good foodie should treat himself/herself to every once in a while.  Even if you're not a foodie, but really want to impress one, you can't go wrong with this place.\n\nCraigie does just about everything right from hospitality, service, and of course the food.   The staff was warm and inviting, and the service was about the attentive yet unobtrusive.  For its high-end caliber food, the atmosphere is more casual and relaxed rather than uptight and pretentious.  \n\nCraigie's food though is the true highlight here with great quality and care put into selecting fresh local ingredients, and if you opt for a tasting menu, to creating unique dishes for the table.  I opted for the 10 course meal to experience the breadth of flavors, and was not disappointed.  A warning that the food might be meat heavy was not warranted at least for our menu that evening.  We had 3 seafood-centric dishes, 2 veggie centric, 1 pasta, and then 2 meat dishes.  That was topped off with 5 desserts for me and my friend. \n\nEach dish was well crafted, flavorful and distinct.  If there were anything to nitpick for me, I would say the desserts aren't quite up to par with the rest of the meal.  This preceding dishes were spectacular while the desserts were just good (save the homemade peanut butter cookie with peanut butter ice-cream which was out of this world).  However, I don't really like dessert at all, and my usual complaint would be that they were too sweet for me.  Others may  find them more to their liking.\n\nThe true highlight of the evening for me though were the mocktails.  As a non-drinker, often relegated to water or some boring juice drink, the bartender crafted what was a series of lovely and beautiful drinks - with unsual flavors - that complimented the food well.  Truly eye-opening, and in my opinion, worth visiting Craigie for alone.  I had my friend who does drink try them, and she was equally impressed with the unique concoctions. \n\nYes, this place is expensive but worth every cent.  I came out stuffed,  unlike another well-received local restaurant offering wonderfully creative fair too *cough* o ya*cough*.  In all seriously, the bill for both places probably came out to about the same, though Craigie offers about 3x as much food.  Not a knock on the other place (I like it there too) but just different."]
["Overall, the food was good. Not great, but good. However, the server was quite pretentious and the menu was unnecessarily complex. I'm glad that I tried it, but will never return due to the general attitude I experienced."]
["2 words sum it all: Pork Belly\n\nNot something you hear on a Sunday brunch menu but there you have it. I went with a group of close friends and we all were yearning for this meal. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He walked us through the menu, and while the pork jowls (fried fatty deliciousness) sounded really tempting, none of us wanted to indulge that much on a Sunday during Lent. He gave my very indecisive group ample time to hem and haw. \n\nWe all settled on our dishes: Burger, Burger with Pork Belly, Pork Belly Panini, and the grits. A gigantic fry lover myself, the shoe string fries that came with my pork belly panini were out of this world. I'm not sure how they seasoned them, but they had just enough of a kick for my senses to do a double take. The burger is a popular item that seems to be get props here and was, as expected, heavenly. \n\nBut my panini - I am at a loss for words at how delicious my pork belly was. I still have dreams of the pork belly. It was perfectly textured and seasoned, and, accompanied with the fried eggplant, gave it the right flavor combination to send my senses through the roof.\n\nI have a friend visiting soon and we plan on going there for dinner. Yes, it is SO good it merits 2 (and more) visits."]
["I'm definitely a foodie and am enamored with those who choose to become chefs (such a thankless job and almost no one succeeds in opening their own place), so I love open kitchens.  Lots of restaurants have open kitchens but none like this.  We were seated 5ft or so from the expediter and it was awesome to see the orchestra of chefs, waiters and managers -- taking control on a semi-busy night.   We saw every spoon drop, every saute pan whisked and every dessert plated.  \n\nThe locale is much improved from their last spot.  The new place must be gathering a whole new crowd.  They are going for a hip look, clustering of old pictures and mirrors, worn wooden floor and sleek tables.  The only thing that doesn't vibe are the fugly ceiling panels.  Super middle school classroom looking.  They could have upped the legit factor with a different choice.\n\nThe old place was just that, old.  And stuffy and too small and totally off the beaten path.  But it had a French style grace to it that meshed well with the style of food.  With that said, I love the newly added bar area (and the drink menu in general since they used to only have wine), I definitely plan on grabbing a drink there with a girlfriend soon to people (or maybe manager) watch.  \n\nMy only complaint about COM is that they beat you over the head with their food knowledge and local food policy.  It is kind of like if you are in high school and go on a date with the star basketball player who've you've watched play, read about many times in the paper and fantasized about for years and then he bores you to death by spewing his stats all night.  COM--you're cool and hip, so don't ruin it by spending the whole night telling us how cool and hip you are."]
['Went here with the wife for a postponed valentines day dinner. We had an early reservation at 6:30 on a Friday. We both ordered the 3 course meal and a half bottel of champaign. In addition we had a bone marrow appetizer. All around the food was very good, although I will probably go with something more exotic than a steak next time, it was somewhat boring. We were given a complimentary tasting of a small dish and mine was a fish on a crispy chip. I think that was my favorite dish of the whole meal. I will certainly have to try the tasting menu next time around. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 has to be the service. It was adequate but our server seemed cold and somewhat uninterested. For a $300 meal adequate service just is not good enough. With that said we will certainly be back in the near future.']
["There should be a funeral for the loss of the confit'ed pig head on the menu.  There is nothing better in life than an entire plate full of delicious pork fat.  On the bright side, it will apparently return one day.  \n\nThe cocktails are above average and everything I've ever had here has been amazing.  Highly recommended."]
['Really amazing food and drinks. A tiny bit expensive but I think it should be expected.\nReservation is a must.\nReally recommend.']
["craigie on main was enchanting from start to finish. did the 6 course chefs whim and was blown away by the intricacy and detail that was put into each and every detail on the plate (and how ridiculously delicious everything was). Highlights included the smoked mackerel, sturgeon, and bagel chip amuse bouche, the salad of warm greens, asparagus, asparagus foam (yes, this was as exciting as it sounds!), ham, and farm fresh poached egg, and the entree of the most tender hangar steak i've ever encountered with oxtail pastrami and bok choy. i mean i would probably have never noticed if they left off the oxtail pastrami, but i loved knowing it was there. \n\nmy only complaint is that i was really craving a chocolate dessert, but then again, perfect flan and pineapple sorbet is nothing to get too upset over. \n\noverall, a perfect meal in a delightful setting. i cannot wait to return!"]
["I just went to Craigie brunch for the multiple-th time and feel it's ripe time to review their brunch. The pancakes are always perfectly crunchy on the outside and fluffy+tender inside, so aptly delicately sweetened and the toppings are always so perfectly sweet and omg...delisssssh. I never put syrup on it because I want to taste the fruit compote and pancake batter properly. Mouthgasm!! It will be close to impossible to recreate this in a home kitchen by a home cook, it's worth paying for these. \n\nBurger (toothsome, loosely packed beef patty of top top flavor+awesome mace ketchup, perfectly buttery brioche, crunchy exterior-puffy interior thick-cut fries), panino (melty cheese inside crunchy, hearty bread with always top notch pairing of fillings!) come next in the recommendations. There are also always something interesting, like some hash dish and some special. Those are good too. I would skip the smoked fish dish (fish changes) just because there are too many other items that are way better."]
["The whole experience was a mess.  Drinks that were taking ages to show up, ton's of people packed into a small area, orders that seemed to have been lost only to show up 15 minutes later.  \nBut it was great.  We were a small group, packed into a corner by the bar.  People multiplied at an alarming rate and we even took turns sitting down on the few available seats.  The servers had to forge through small cracks between us to deliver alcoholic sustenance.  Orders were yelled over heads as other people  were pointed at to see if they wanted in.  With everything I had a fantastic black bass that I still think fondly of and a couple of terrific drinks.  I'll be back, with less people."]
['Attentive service, nice cocktail list, lively vibe but food was disappointing.  I had heard many fabulous reviews about Craigie on Main, but found the food unexciting and somewhat bland.  I had a friend in town from Los Angeles, who is exposed to really wonderful restaurants.  We had the eight course tasting menu and when we left she said "it wasn\'t great".  That about sums it up.']
['Finally got to go to and enjoy this famous restaurant. It went beyond my high expectations--it was really almost perfect, from the ambiance, to the service, to the plating, to the food. The only thing I had that wasn\'t an "A" was my coffee with dessert. That\'s it.\n\nHere\'s what our dinner party had. For first courses, we ordered the pate plate, a sashimi plate and for me, a fresh egg (poached) on a bed of mushrooms and fiddle heads. All were spot on--unbelievable. The entrees we had/shared were pork 3-ways, salmon with beets and pine nuts, and for me, a sirloin steak with potatoes. Again, all were amazing! I think mine was arguably the best: the steak was perfectly cooked and had tremendous flavor and juice, and the potatoes were possibly the best potatoes I\'ve ever eaten. For the dessert course, we ordered the 3-sherbert dish (grapefruit, yogurt, and mango flavored), the apricot tart with amaretto ice cream, and my dish, a chocolate/bacon crust pie filled with bourbon/pecan ice cream and pecan crumbles on top. Holy WOW, I can\'t even begin to describe how phenomenal all these desserts were, but my pie was...pure genius and probably the best and most creative dessert I\'ve ever had. Note that all Craigie\'s ice creams/sherberts are homemade. Amazing.\n\nLast but not least,  I should mention my mojito was fantastic, and on par with the best ones I enjoyed in Aruba.\n\nCraigie on Main may be the best restaurant I\'ve ever been to. It\'s definitely in the top 2 or 3. Truly an experience of a lifetime and worth every penny. Don\'t second guess a decision to go here; it just doesn\'t get better than this.']
["Overall, I was a bit underwhelmed by Craigie. It was good but didn't knock my socks off. While food was delicious with unusual combination of flavors and service was absolutely impeccable, I can't honestly say it was memorable or outstanding for the price. It was one of the most expensive dinners I've had and while I certainly enjoyed my meal, it just didn't measure up to my high expectations. We had a chef tasting menu and I left feeling hungry after six dishes. While very well thought-through and flavorful, each dish was super tiny. Amuse bouche was nothing to write home about, I can't even remember what it was. I loved the scallop sashimi but definitely would have liked to have more than one bite of it. The fish, pasta and venison courses were good with fish being my favorite, pasta - meh (I don't like whole wheat pasta but the sauce was good) and venison - great but I could have eaten three of them! On a plus side, vermouth mint palate cleanser was so yummy and the desserts were to die for, definitely one of the best desserts I've ever had! In general, I prefer more casual, bistro-type French restaurants like Gaslight. What I found sort of appalling is that Gaslight serves you a fresh warm baguette whereas bread at Craigie was cold and hard - oh the annoying little details! Do they get to you when you're dropping some $250+ for dinner ;) \nWhat can I say? Check it out, it's definitely worth experiencing for a special occasion. You will enjoy your dinner if you're a foodie and adventurous about trying new dishes and ingredients, just don't come here on an empty stomach!"]
["Cannot say enough about the service, the attentiveness of the staff and the dinner that we enjoyed.  Although I'm a bit delayed in leaving a review, as it's been well over a month, I can still chatter on about the dining experience, itself. \nMy boyfriend made this reservation for us for my birthday and when we arrived, parking was nearly impossible.  Be advised that you should expect to valet, unless you expect that the parking gods will be aligned with you.  Parking is mostly Resident Only and very difficult.  Don't distract from the awesome experience you're about to embark upon by getting po'd at the lack of parking.  Just valet it.\nWe waited just under 5 minutes to be seated and once we were, we had plenty of attention, from numerous employees.  They were generous with their time, explanations and almost 'over did it', which would be my only complaint, if I had to have one.  It felt as though they were watching each time I took a sip of the bottled water and rushed over to refill the sip of water I just took, which was a bit disruptive to me.  Attentive, yes.  A bit too frequent, yes.  As I said, though - my only complaint.  \nI don't recall exactly what I had, so I won't go into the details, but I can say that it was delicious and beautifully presented.  \nI mentioned, in passing, to the waiter as a photo was being taken that it was my birthday and the waiter took it upon himself to accompany our desserts with a simple candle on a separate plate for me to quietly celebrate with.  Quite nice.\nWe had a great corner booth (not sure if that was pure luck or the doings of my outstanding boyfriend) and I would highly recommend requesting that seat, if allowed.  We had a great view of the entire restaurant, weren't seated very close to anyone and it was very intimate which was perfect, considering the occasion.\nA truly wonderful birthday experience."]
['Outstanding food.\n\nA few years back I had an entree called "beef three ways" or something very much like it. Either way, it was an excellent small steak, another portion I do not recall, and finally a patty of seared bone marrow. I do not know how they manage to get it to stick together like that, but it had a slightly crispy exterior, and gooey marrow interior. Outstanding.\n\nTwice now my wife and I have gone here for an anniversary dinner and ordered the tasting menu, except we asked for savory-only. No desserts, that is. Costs a tiny bit more. We ended up getting a few extra courses on the House each time. I strongly recommend the 8-course tasting menu if you have some extra cash to spend. (It was somewhere between $90 and $110. Cannot recall). I believe they also do a less expensive tasting option with fewer courses. Let\'s just say it is, again, outstanding.\n\nPig\'s Knuckles appetizer is also excellent.']
['Great bone marrow, 3 little pigs were tasty, and the service enjoyable!  Will recommend and be back.']
["my overextending gf's treated me to the 6-course tasting menu here for my 30th bday + 3 weeks. which effectively meant I had to wear a pink-feathered Birthday tiara the entire dinner. to my benefit, guys love making comments to deceptively childish looking girls wearing bachelorette apparel. pervs.\n\ngetting back to Craigie... yea so the meal was SICK. not just because it was creative, perfectly flavored, and subtly ostentatious in presentation, but because i could still appreciate it even though I was going to drop dead of a cold at the time. \n\nthe cuts of meat were PRIMO. i went googly-eyed when i saw the daily list of farms and providers they source their ingredients from at the back of the menu. short of listing the animal's names and their likes/dislikes, i felt really farm-iliar (ha) with the food.\n\nthe star of the meal was this lamb trio featuring the most succulent, flavorful cuts from body parts i would rather be ignorant of. i wish i took my leftovers back in my pocket! \n\nanother signature dish was the squid noodles. so light, fresh, tangy, and sweet. try finding that anywhere else (tho i saw Wylie Dufresne make something similar on Iron Chef). \n\nbut all this was K.O.'d by the APPLE+CELERY SORBET \n......\n{singing angel interlude}\n.......\ni'd take this over the olive oil gelato that NYC'ers get all hot and bothered about. i'm pretty sure i sprouted leaves after eating this it was so fresh and green and intriguing. alas, there were 3 subsequent desserts that washed out the flavor. but i still have my memories. and it's against my religion to say no to free dessert. especially because i earned it waiting 45 min for a table while i was secretly dying but trying to look regal.\n\ndespite my feeling of entitlement to the free desserts. i was FLOORED by the service. and it wasn't stuffy either. they maintained the perfect balance of professional, efficient, yet completely amicable. you really feel like ppl are going REALLY out of their way to do something for you that you will REALLY want or are sure to love.\n\ni'll be back. for sure. and i will eat that pig-head dish that i was convinced was on the tasting menu but ended up torturing me by not showing up after 5 courses. Elmer Fudd, i will nibble on your ears. and you will like it."]
["This was my first time at craigie. I heard so much about this burger that's all I wanted. I was naive not to inquire when booking a reservation for dinner to ask if I could get the burger at sit down dining (apparently it is only available at the bar seating or during brunch). I was well aware of the prices going into this but was not aware of how much the staff pressures you to order from the chefs ultra deluxe menu (and you must order for the table not individually). This chef tasting menu is an extra $50 or so a person so we bailed on that. The food was extremely creative and tastey but for over $100 a person for a standard dinner I was expecting more. Atmosphere is great, quality was great just not what I was expecting for the price. Still waiting for that burger."]
['Overpriced restaurant, OK food, and really unprofessional staff. \nWe went to Craigie for a friend\'s birthday, party of 5 people. Two of us  got there a bit earlier and had cocktails at the bar. We had to wait over 20 minutes to be served. We asked two of the bartenders about the cocktails and both of them failed to explain what was in a cocktail or make a recommendation. Then, when we asked for the cocktail sampler, we were told that  you could only have it at your table. At the table, we were told we could only have it at the bar. Also, the 6-course tasting menu was not available unless the whole table ordered it. Basically, whatever question we asked, the answer was first "No." \n\nI had the fried clams appetizer which was mostly fried bread  crumbs and very little clams. I had the artctic char as a main course, which was nice. But the annoying thing was that the staff came in every 5 minutes to ask us if we were done and tried to pull our plates. The actual cocktails were all bitter or sickeningly sweet and tasted like cough syrup. \n\nAlso, the place was really noisy with many people running around, not a relaxing atmosphere at all.']
['I love, love, love Craigie on Main. It\'s the go-to place for me and a good friend of mine when we have our "girl date" nights. The food is excellent and the service is always impeccable. Additionally, their burger (on the bar menu) fully converted my friend from vegetarianism.\n\nWhen we go, we typically sit at the bar so we can order off the (slightly cheaper) menu. Unfortunately you can\'t call ahead for the bar, so even on a weeknight we usually end up waiting 30-45 minutes. But we order cocktails while we\'re waiting, and the staff are just as helpful and attentive to us as if we were already seated.\n\nThe bartender(s) are incredibly nice and personable. They\'ll leave you alone if you\'re happily engaged in conversation with your dinnermates, but you can also have a good talk with them if you are in a sociable mood.\n\nThe food is great, of course. Their pate plate as an appetizer is particularly good. Wine list is excellent. Cocktails are strong and I usually have no idea what we\'re ordering, since the cocktail menu lists ingredients by brand name, not type of alcohol, and as I\'m not a cocktail ninja I usually don\'t really know what to expect.\n\nWe also usually end up with something small for free. Once it was our appetizer, since they felt bad that we\'d waited so long for seats, and we\'ve also gotten an extra glass of wine or a small dessert. As a result we try to tip big. It\'s not a cheap place for dinner, but I think it is worth every penny.']
['Is there no part of the pig which these people can\'t make taste amazing?\n\nWe weren\'t able to sit in the dining room, so a group of 8 took over the bar and ordered everything on the bar menu to share family-style.  I\'m glad we ran the board because it encouraged us to go deep into the strange but rewarding stuff like fried pig tails.  The potato galette with salmon roe was also a pleasant surprise.  My favorite was the charcuterie plate with its buttery foie gras and earthy rabbit.\n\nThe wine list is expensive and limited, but carefully curated for quality.  Those who ordered the "whim" flight of cocktails were very happy with the offerings.  (I admire a place gutsy enough to serve a Corpse Reviver to someone who has not specifically ordered it.)\n\nNow that I\'ve been introduced to this place, I need to go back and try the half pig\'s head and the chef\'s whim menu.  \n\nWord of advice: if you\'re planning on ordering the Chef\'s Whim menu on Sunday, make a reservation if at all possible.  Seatings happen only every half hour and you may have to wait a long time or look for other alternatives.']
["I went for the burger....Amazing!   It opens at 530PM and we show up at 525PM and there were 7 people in line ahead of us.  Crazy right?    Everyone goes straight to the bar area since everyone is there for the same thing- Cragie on Main's infamous burger.   We order that as well as a side of Bone Marrow with fresh bread which I found quite gross but the other guys I was with found it amazing.  The burger on the other hand was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing....I would say it was in my top two or 3 burgers ever with Farmstead in Providence and Kooper's Tavern in Baltimore.  The bartender and service was also amazing.  Very attentive and we had amazing liquor drinks made for us.  I would recommend this place to anyone for a classy burger or a fancy (but expensive) meal."]
['Tabula rasa--I\'ve never been to the Craigie Street Bistro, so this review lacks all the "back in the day" pretension, but I\'d be lying if I said I wasn\'t positively giddy at the prospect of another fine dining establishment in Central Square..\n\nCraigie on Main delivers. The venue is gray and the fiberglass ceilings are hard to conceal, but it\'s still spacious and warm. I watched the bar spill over from the opening night crowds, but it was never obnoxious or claustrophobic. In fact, the bar space rocks! I\'m convinced my bartender must moonlight as a superhero on his off nights. I\'ve never seen anyone move with the quickness and his sixth sense came in handy, since he knew exactly where everything was on OPENING NIGHT. Hell, I walked in and he was swinging two shakers over his head at once. Clearly not a man to be fucked with.\n\nI wanted to sample the cocktail menu my first time out and I wasn\'t disappointed. They hit all the high notes and your favorite intoxicant is surely represented, dressed in a lovely number, and ready to please. It\'s always interesting to order a drink and ask the bartender if they\'d recommend something else. It\'s a quick way to cut through the filler and find the gems on a cocktail menu, but it\'s even more interesting when they won\'t do it--an act I\'d compare to asking a parent which is their favorite child. I went with the stock Champ de Elysees, which rocked. If brandy, chartreuse and lime do it for you, there\'s no reason to walk by Craigie on Main. \n\nAnd that\'s how I\'ll end it; I\'m so looking forward to revisiting until I feel comfortable handing over that fifth star and I have no reason to believe Craigie will disappoint.']
["Best restaurant in the city. \n\nThey are located right on a corner in a funky space - it's a bit tight when it's packed (and seriously it's ALWAYS packed - one Friday night we were there every table was filled till 11:30 at night). Reservations are not easy to come by here, but it's worth it - so book in advance.\n\nService is always good - the staff is so friendly here. But it's the food and drinks that keep folks coming back. The dishes are inventive (like pigs head!)  but absolutely delicious. I've been here a half a dozen times and never tasted anything I didn't like. And the cocktails are so tasty - not the standard ones you see at every restaurant. Even ones I was skeptical I'd like were awesome (like the northern lights and ardoise)."]
["Crowded for a Wednesday night at the beginning of winter so they must be doing something right. I started with the pate, which was good and followed up with the special of the night, suckling pig head split between two people. It was interesting to see a restaurant serving this and the pig was delicious. My husband was a little disappointed because the pig ear (the best part) was a little burnt and we couldn't eat it. \n\nAll in all the service was good and food was good. Nothing mind blowing, but worth going back."]
["I don't know what more to add that hasn't been said -- Craigie is almost perfect.  Well-deserving of a five-star review, as I don't think I'll ever have better bone marrow, nor a better donut.  The service is first-rate as well."]
['Every sip, every bite that I took was delightful.  And pricey!  The pricey factor will ensure that Craigie\'s glorious roasted chicken doesn\'t become a regular habit for me, but the yummy factor will make me think about it frequently with longing.  I also had a couple of bites of my companion\'s milk-fed, organic veal -- wonderfully tender, lovely flavor.\n\nAnd then there\'s the Northern Lights cocktail (recommended by our exceptionally helpful waiter):  simply gorgeous.  I had three!  And the thing is, usually I eschew brightly colored pseudo-martinis, having long ago graduated from cosmos to rob roys. But Craigie\'s "libations" menu tantalized with an array of intriguing concoctions.  These, too, are pricey, but the mixture of scotch, St. Germain (a spirit made from wild elderflowers), lemon &amp; bitters was irresistible.  \n\nMy entrée was too filling to even consider having dessert -- but the offerings on the dessert menu sounded like they\'d be exceptionally good had there been room in my stomach.\n\nI\'m giving this five stars because the food, decor, service, and drinks were all superb.  I attach a caveat:  Craigie on Main is far too expensive for a grad student like me to frequent, unless someone else is paying ;).']
['I know Craigie keeps making its way onto various "Best Of" lists, but I have eaten here twice now and both times was unimpressed. The first time I went was wiht my parents during the Christmas holiday. Although we sampled a variety of offal/non-meat-based appetizers and each tried a different entree, all three of us left feeling underwhelmed. Although expensive, the dishes we sampled lacked innovative preparation and complex flavor. It seemed the kitchen was relying on their use of unorthodox pig (and chicken and cow...) parts to spice up the cuisine, when, in reality, all these ingredients made for was a foodie-sounding menu. Service was so-so, and was certainly nothing to write home about. \n\nFast forward almost a year: after reading numerous articles lauding Craigie\'s brunch, kitchen, bar, and especially their burger, I was ready to give the restaurant another chance. After all, maybe they were just having an off night. We made a reservation a week and a half in advance, but when we arrived, our table wasn\'t yet ready and we were herded to the bar for a 40-minute wait. Fine- I\'ve worked in restaurants for five years. I get that tables don\'t always turn when you want them to.  Forty minutes behind on a reservation in a highly celebrated restaurant with no comp was, however, a little unexpected. \n\nWe enjoined our cocktails at the bar and, after our wait, were finally seated at a nice table by the window. After a couple minutes our server arrived and we asked if the burger was still available and we could get it at a table (instead of in the bar). She said she\'d check, then walked away. Returning several minutes later with a tray, she wordlessly began stacking the contents of our table atop it. As she pivoted to walk (ostensibly) to the bar, I said something to the effect of "so can we get the burger?" A little put-off, she responded with a "no" and that it "had been sold out for hours," but she thought we wanted to sit in the bar anyway and thus was taking us there. Arbitrarily.      ... I appreciate the proactive attitude, but not asking guests what they wanted to do, silently and inexplicably clearing their table, and generally adopting an attitude of annoyance really left a sour taste in our mouths. \n\nAfter the table location confusion, we ordered a nice bottle of wine and settled into our booth (not at the bar). I ordered the roast chicken, while my boyfriend ordered a rabbit dish. We also split an assortment of pates and cured meats as well as the duck fat brussels sprouts with dinner. The pates were pretty standard fare, but were served with a variety of interesting sauces, mustards, and compotes which really made the dish something special. The duck fat brussels sprouts were as rich as expected- they had a great char and nuttiness that made them truly addictive. Our entrees were, unfortunately, rather a disappointment. Although my chicken was moist, it tasted like something I could have made at home. My boyfriend found his rabbit similarly underwhelming. \n\nAfter two attempts at Craigie, I still can\'t figure out what makes this place such a favorite for (what seems like) the rest of Boston. That said, I\'ve yet to try the burger or brunch--both of which have quite venerable reputations of their own. Whether or not those accolades are to be trusted, though, is something yet to be seen.']
["The decor is excellent, and not distracting from the food. The waitstaff is the same: professional, very comfortable, super capable, pleasant and with no additional flourish or artifice that you if find sometimes when they aren't sure of what they are doing. The drinks were excellent, served with perfect timing. \nThe food was clearly the centerpiece of everything, without screaming it to you. Absolutely delicious. I think what impressed me most, was the level of consciousness that went into the food. Each flavor was clearly present, balanced with some other flavor that made sense in an interesting way for that flavor to be there. The portions were actually generous for gourmet food and I left pleasantly stuffed and buzzed. I could not ask for more. \nThe staff in general took care of us in a way that is impressive. The valet took our crappy car in a way that was assuring that it would not be further crapified. The hosts took our unneeded outerwear, in a manner that appeared more as a desire for us to be comfortable. Our waitress gave us time with each other so that we could enjoy each other and enjoy the food. Other waitstaff brought things at different times based on the food and our state at that moment.\nI had the thought there, that they really completely understand the whole package of fine dining, not just one part of it."]
["I've been twice and never ate fresher or tastier food.  1st time a la carte, second time a pescetarian tasting menu, amazing.  Farm to Table.  What more can I say.  I mean, octopus that was as tender as a white fish or salmon, and I thought I didn't like octopus...  I could talk all day..."]
["Casual atmosphere, amazing culinary experience. The service is great. Definitely the place to go for someone who enjoys trying new food, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars. \nIt is the perfect place to celebrate an anniversary with a loved one, or go with other foodies. It is a little pricey, so don't go there in large groups or on a first date.\nMy only complaint was the food was a tad-bit too heavy, and was not as great as expected."]
['Craigie on Main is a stone\'s throw away from another excellent French-informed restaurant, Hungry Mother, but the feel is very different here. The decor is classy and upscale without being imposing, and will leave you with an impression of the color white, and of course of the stainless steel of the kitchen which is planted firmly in the dining area. Humorously, France stars prominently in the Men\'s room decor of both restaurants, and it\'s clear that the chef/owner here thinks that all things masculine and delicious have emanated from that country\'s hallowed soil.\n\n  The cocktail menu deserves special mention: these are some seriously tasty and creative drinks. Barring encyclopedic knowledge of alcohols and spirits, you will not recognize the names of the drinks ingredients, but you can play a game called \'identify the noun\' as you browse through a slew of foreign and impossible sounding alcohol names. Rest assured that all of the drinks are delicious, and most will teach you something interesting about spirits that you didn\'t know before.\n\n  Although it\'s a verbal item only, if the burger is available you should seriously, seriously consider dropping all other plans that you had for ordering off of the menu and eat the burger instead. Try to go early in the night to maximize your chances of being able to eat one of these things. On a scale of "mmmmm" to "my brain has melted" the burger hovers somewhere around "sexual".\n\n  The menu changes often. This is a first-rate, James Beard blessed establishment, so most of the time the appetizers are exciting and the entrees are indulgent and delicious. However, they are experimenting back there in the kitchen, and the prices make a dud on the menu all the more painful. I had the smelts, and for $18 dollars it was a plate of expertly fried fish - no more, no less. It could be that it was plated incorrectly, as the small amount of garnish added an important flavor to the dish. However, the mushroom ragout was very nicely done. Just...be ready... If something does not wow you and if you\'re vocal, but courteous, in expressing your opinion, they may allow you to order something else at no charge.\n\n  The servers and runners are numerous and efficient, as is to be expected in a French style gang. The restaurant also understands that servers need to be able to eat the food to know what the hell is going on with the menu, and they allow the servers to bring guests for a meal that is steeply discounted. This is necessary, as any good server will tell you: Henry Ford was right, workers need to be able to buy the products they are helping to produce.\n\n  Do not come here with someone who doesn\'t know or appreciate food. They will complain of small portions. They will harass you about the writing on the menu. They will gawk at the prices and make comments about the blue light special meat deals at the local Stop N\' Shop. If your partner is someone who likes to have their food\'s weight listed right on the menu (16 oz steak!), wait until they are out of town and come here by yourself, checkbook balanced and ready for the hit.\n\n  If you\'re going with a friend, I recommend that you sit at the bar: the full menu is available and you can ask many more questions of the bartender than you will be able to of your server (not that the servers are inattentive, it\'s just that bartenders are conveniently imprisoned). Also, the diners at the bar are usually of the open and interesting variety and it is a great place to strike up a conversation with a new set of people while enjoying great drinks and a great meal.']
['My partner and I went to Craigie on Main for the first time to celebrate our anniversary.  Given the price point, we were waiting for a special occasion to visit Craigie on Main, and it did not disappoint!  The food and drinks were very good, but it was the service that really stood Craigie on Main apart.  Our servers were very informative, attentive, and really went above and beyond to ensure that we were enjoying our meal and experience there.  Would definitely recommend!']
["I'd say second best meal I've had in Boston, but I didn't do the full monty; I only had an app and a an entree. Sadly, I didn't have room for dessert...tragic I know. Luckily I am local and will return.\n\nThe pig tails app was 5 stars all the way. Everything about them was a tasty fireworks display. They were crunchy, salty, and so rich they melted in my mouth. The peanut oil gave it an asian touch that was unique and unexpected.\n\nThe pork 3 ways was equally decadent-I didn't know I could apply that word to anything but dessert, but that is what this meal was. The pork confit was like nothing I've ever tried before. Crunchy on top, perfectly cooked pork on the middle.  I loved the rib next, full of flavor and fall off the bone. But I didn't like the pork belly. This I believe is due to my dislike for the texture of the dish. I've only had pork belly once before in a much smaller portion and I liked it, so maybe this wasn't my night for it.\n\nThe service was stellar, as was the atmosphere.\n\nThe Nettle Settle cocktail was again unique and complimented my food choices well.\n\nThe only thing I didn't love was the bread. Don't get me wrong, I love Iggy's Bread, but it seemed out of place. Why not make your own bread and serve it warm with a maple butter or something equal to the high quality of everything else?\n\nIn the end I will be back either to eat in the bar or for another special occasion."]
["Haven't been to Craigie since they moved from their old location - this location is much more inviting.  Server was fabulous, helpful, attentive, nice wine list, octopus &amp; asparagus apps were very good, fish entree was nice, pork three ways was good (although not a huge fan of pork belly), brussel sprouts grilled with duck fat were awesome, bone marrow (side dish) was not for us.  Desserts were absolutely fabulous.  Be in the mood for meat and you'll be all set."]
["SOOoo good. \n\nWe did a cocktail sampler and the bartender picked the drinks. They were amazing, old fashion, delicious drinks. The wine list was great as well (had wine w main courses).\n\nFood is def. the best I've had in MA so far. Good rich flavors, spiced just right and perfect portion sizes.\n\nService was on point as well!\n\nWorth the $$$"]
["Craigie on Main is expensive. I'm just putting that out there. It's expensive, although arguably it's worth it. I have been to this new location twice, and both times I've enjoyed the bar menu (again, expensive), and several delicious cocktails. \n\nOur bartender was quite the charmer, and our other various servers were all knowledgeable and entertaining. My dining partner had the pig's tails the first time we went, and he enjoyed them, although wished they had come with a leafy green (to off-set the salty, fatty quality of them). I had the potato croquettes with salmon roe, and they were delicious and crunchy. We also shared the charcuterie plate.  Loved the grilled bread, and the headcheese, also the lamb rillette. I have to admit that the swoop of purple mustard charmed me as well. All in all, this was my favorite thing we ate. \n\nOn my second trip to Craigie, I split a burger with someone. It was well-cooked, seasoned, and the bread was good. I was pleased to see that tomatoes are not served out of season. \n\nBoth of my dining experiences were above par, and I hope to come back for a full dinner service some day. Just have to save up, first..."]
['I love cocktails.\n\nI go to the bar at Craigie on Main for the same reason I sometimes get a BMW or Mini Zipcar -- just because I can\'t afford the real thing doesn\'t mean I don\'t enjoy a taste. and oh, what tastes Craigie on Main\'s top-notch servers will bring to your table. The $20 grass-fed hamburger (turns out, I\'m just *mostly* vegetarian). The Northwest cocktail. The oysters.\n\nNext time you feel like treating your tastebuds (and your squeeze), dig out your nice clothes from the back of your closet, head to Craigie on Main, and order the cocktail flight (the bartender\'s choice of 4 cocktail samples, served from light to dark, for $20ish).\n\nand then, the next time you walk through Central, you can show off to your friends "Oh, do you ever go to this place? It\'s pretty expensive but, you know, worth it".']
["OK, Craigie on Main is impressive.  Never made it to Craigie on...itself (kinky) but i have a feeling that this is just a bigger, newer, funkier version of its original self.  You can tell it's a new restaurant, because even the seasoned looking staff look a little disoriented - but not to the point of affecting the evening or experience.\n\nAnd the menu created and printed at 5:09pm today - how in the hell can you beat that?  it's hard to compare this to most other restaurants that seem to pump out carbon copies of the entrees from previous nights - here you are destined to get something fresh and thoughtful\n\nI could go back for the soup alone.\n\nand I will."]
['My husband left a very honest and educated review about our dinner here on May 8th. It was disappointing from the time we sat down at our badly placed table until we left over three hours later. The service was very poor and honestly there is not one dish I remember. The only memory I have is of the chef at the pass constantly yelling for "Jill" to give her time on whatever she was dragging. Bad dinners and poor experiences are expected and sometimes excusable. But, taking down a review without contacting the writer I feel is cowardly and shameful.']
["Amazing food, service and atmosphere.   We had dinner in the bar in a cozy booth (great for people watching) and it was fantastic. The waiter was well versed on the bar and the menu.\n\nCrazy food here (pigs head, sweetbreads, octopus) if you are adventurous.  The organic chicken 2 ways was the best chicken I think I've ever had.  Loved it and will definitely go back!"]
["Written 10/6/08 before move to Main St. \n\nMy wife and I arrived with another couple at our appointed time and were quickly seated. The dining room is quite small but warmly appointed. \n\nOur waiter was excellent; friendly, knowledgeable, self effacing, there when we needed him and not when we didn't. \n\nTwo things at Craigie can conspire against the unadventurous. One, the menu is short. And two, they serve a fair amount of offal. \n\nThe American Heritage Dictionary defines offal as (1) Waste parts, especially of a butchered animal; (2) Refuse; rubbish. \n\nFoodies will agree that this is an awful definition for what can arguably be some of the best food on the planet, especially in the skilled hands of the folks at Craigie. \n\nExamples of the offal on Craigie's menu last weekend: \n\n1. Beef marrow - offered as an appetizer. \n2. Cocks' combs - also an appetizer. \n3. Sweetbreads - an appetizer you guess? Wrong, an entree! \n4. Cod cheeks - okay, not actually offal but it sounds like it. \n\nThe food was so good that I wished for more variety but I was delighted by my two choices, cocks' combs and sweetbreads. The cocks' combs were served as a ragout with mushrooms, in-house sausage and a poached egg. The sweetbreads were perfect as well. Served with a deliciously rich brown sauce. The only knock on this dish is there wasn't much else on the plate besides the sweetbreads. My wife had them as well and she felt a bit overwhelmed by the amount and the lack of sides. \n\nI wish I had the ability to wax more poetically about my first experience here. My final analysis is that it was a wonderful experience and one I highly recommend. If you love food and are willing to go out on a limb, you'll love Craigie Street Bistro."]
["The food was beyond anything I ever expected, even after reading all the rave reviews.  The waiter almost scared me away from the slow cooked organic Tazmanian sea trout, because he gave me such a schpeel about how many customers order it, expecting a white flakey fish, and are shocked when the fish comes and resembles salmon more than trout.  I was happy for the information that it was similar to salmon, but perhaps didn't need to know that some customers are disappointed with it when it arrives.\n\nFortunately it didn't scare me enough to make me change my order (though I did hesitate for a moment) and I'm so glad I had it.  It was tender in texture and robust in flavor.  The  almond-Serano ham broth had so many layers of flavor going on, dotted with delicious marinated shrimp and plump mussels.   \n\nI also had a bite of the organic roasted chicken and was equally wowed.  Again, such robust and interesting flavors, and perfectly cook, juicy meat.  We also shared the Octopus appetizer, which again was amazing, due to the Chorizo sauce that it was dressed in.  I really think the chef is a master of sauces, and I imagine every dish is a homerun, because of this mastery.\n\nI was slightly disappointed that we couldn't try some appetizers off the bar menu while sitting in the non-bar area, but the waiter said that they would be happy to put in their notes to ask us which side of the restaurant we want to sit in, the next time we call for a reservation.  It's service like that that makes this restaurant shine.  \n\nThe interior was beautiful, so cozy and perfect for a winter night.  I loved the exposed kitchen, loved seeing the calmness with which the chefs worked.  It's not what I would expect from a busy restaurant, and it made me feel like my food was prepared with love and good energy.\n\nI look forward to coming back soon to try the bar side of things."]
['Came here to celebrate our wedding anniversary.  Did the tasting menu.  Service, food, and wine selections were flawless.  A true treat.']
['Crispy pig head, crispy pig tails.  Northern lights cocktail.  Love it, love it, love it.  Craigie never disappoints.']
['We enjoyed an amazing dining experience while also getting to know a business vendor. Not only was the food beyond expectation (tasting menu to die for) but the service was extraordinary. We arrived after ten on a weeknight, were seated in the bar area and were nearly the last people to leave. It was pouring out, our dinner companions soaked and weary and we were nervous that this would be an all out bomb. But by the end of the meal we were making plans for future food excursions, our companion asked for a copy of the day\'s menu as a memento of the evening and we all ran out into the storm content. Could I tell you what I ate? Yes. But you should just go, order outside your comfort zone or play it safe and get some chicken because as the server said, "It will be the best chicken you\'ve ever had."']
['Poor value for the money\nThe food was good, but VERY expensive for what it is.  The service comes complete with serious attitude.\nI would not recommend this place, unless you feel the need to follow the hop crowd.']
["I don't usually give five stars but they deserve it now, I went there for the third time this year and just sat at the bar. The place was as always jammed but not too overcrowded. Their selection of spirits was awesome and growing, I like that very much. I had the scallop ceviche and Ipswitch clams which I love because I mapped nearly all the clam flats in the Essex river basin 25 years ago. My scallops were very fresh and I really enjoyed the delicate flavors. My clams were nicely crusted with corn flour and i could really taste the marsh, only something I would like. But I observed people eating what looked like the best burger in Boston and they only make a limited few each night. Another fun time at Craige on Main now a Boston tradition for me."]
['WOW! This place is the very best!  I loved it from beginning to end.  The staff was warm and welcoming.  Our server Emily was fantastic.  The food was tremendous.   Everything was so good.  Stared with the beet salad that had an incredible miso dressing and oysters that were so fresh and sweet.  Shared the roast chicken and it was everything I hoped for and more. Added the two special side dishes for the evening - bone marrow with toast and brussel sprouts roasted in duck fat.  The meal was exceptional.  Had the sour cream cheese cake and the affogato for dessert.  Both were wonderful.  I love this restaurant.']
['+ food was good but if you are used to fine European cuisine it is not even close\n\n+/- service was ok but not superior\n\n- open kitchen smells and your clothes smell as well afterwards']
['The anxiety is palpable.\n\nFirst and foremost, I don\'t care how hyped your restaurant is... it is just plain annoying when, having made a reservation three weeks in advance, my choices for a Saturday night dinner time are 9:30pm or 10:00pm, everything else booked solid. We\'re not talking about culinary enlightenment here. Perhaps this is due to their somewhat small size. I like making a dinner reservation a couple days before, maybe a week tops. Apparently three weeks just wasn\'t enough in this case. The cynic in me just instantly feels like I\'m dealing with a pretentious establishment. It\'s not entirely fair to blame this on Craigie... tables are just in high demand. But know that I went into my reservation with an attitude of "This better be worth it..." Get your reservations out of the way as early as you can.\n\nSecondly, this place will stress you out. The environment may seem cozy, but on a Saturday night Craigie On Main is bedlam. Servers rush back and forth, and the whole thing seems a little disorderly. It is very interesting to be able to observe an open kitchen, but the cacophony emerging from this open space can really put a damper on anyone expecting a relaxing meal. You will also leave smelling like the kitchen. I will note that I was here for a date, and so I was hoping for something a little more intimate. On any other night, this kind of environment may have been exciting and an experience in and of itself.\n\nAs we were walking in, I caught a glimpse of the hostess having a private moment: She was pushing down with the palms of her hands, taking frantic breaths, and saying, "Ok... ok... breathe... breathe...". However, she greeted us with a lovely smile and calmly and efficiently directed us to the bar while they prepared our table. The bartender was also visibly stressed, but upon closer observation she was holding the entire operation in order and handling herself like a pro. Want a cocktail that isn\'t on the menu? Not a problem. Our server was also top notch and knowledgeable. I regret that I don\'t remember names, here, but I made sure to compliment the staff on their survey (provided with the check). We were seated 15 minutes late. Not a big deal, but again a little frustrating given the already late hour.\n\nUltimately, what ruins the entire experience are two things. First is the anxiety level mentioned above that will turn off most casual diners looking for a pleasant, intimate meal. Second is quite simply the perceived value for the price. This is an unusually pricey meal. Quite frankly, it\'s good, but it\'s not THAT good. For two of us, we spent (after tax and slightly over 20% tip) approximately $175.00. What we received at that price level were two cocktails while we waited for our table, an appetizer which we shared, two entrees, and two glasses (not a bottle) of wine. The value just isn\'t there. Especially when the entrees (both were pork 3 ways) were small, and much too salty. And look, I\'m not Joe American who needs a heaping plate of food in front of him. The price and perceived value just didn\'t match for me. Maybe this is just the inflated cost of good, local ingredients. I can\'t really say. The pork was mostly fatty and over-salted.\n\nWhere I did perceive a better value is in their brunch offerings. At around $55 per person, their fixed price brunch menu is a much more satisfying choice. Having done both brunch and dinner at this establishment, I can honestly say that I will probably only return for brunch... and probably not very often since it is still a very expensive brunch, indeed.\n\nAll in all, I just can\'t justify a fourth star. For me, the only thing keeping it from dropping down to two stars is their service, who seemed to admirably handle themselves well despite the anxious nature of this establishment.']
["In the interest of full disclosure I must admit that I'm a total ethicatarian and find anything with local ingredients entirely appealing. \n\nI went to Craigie on a Friday night and they were packed. We were told we could not have a table in the bar area because they were reserved, but after a half hour and a few drinks we asked a server passing by.  He reported back to us that the tables indeed were not reserved but just that the kitchen couldn't handle any more traffic at the moment. Nevertheless he invited us to sit at a table and promised to come by and take our order as soon as he could.  Maybe this situation waiting for the table would have seemed annoying if I had a specific timeline, but I like to enjoy my drinks, and I like to enjoy my food and thus, I was happy to have a long and leisurely meal - particularly in the name of serving quality food.\n\nIn any case I am not a pork person ever- really - but for some reason I felt inspired by the pork dish on the menu that night - I believe it was pork served three ways.  Absolutely phenomenal, you may be reading the words of the converted when it comes to pig.  I also recall the oysters being particularly fresh and my drink made with organic Rain vodka and sage to be strikingly refreshing.\n\nI therefore wholeheartedly recommend Craigie on Main to anyone who appreciates good food and drink, AND who importantly has the time to wait at this very busy Cambridge spot."]
['Disgusting and UNSANITARY.  I saw a waitress pour a half bottle of wine that was at a table back into a larger bottle that was being served by the bar to the restaurant.  The manager agreed it was not sanitary but still did not get rid of the bottle of wine that was tainted.']
["Went here twice in a week since we used to love it when it was Craigie Street Bistrot (then we had to move to Asia).  \n\nFirst visit was not very pleasant as we were seated in the main dining room.  It was dark and claustrophobic especially since we have 2 young boys.  We ordered the Degustation menu and that too was a disappointment because it was too seafood heavy.  Our waiter was efficient but not overly friendly.  The only highlight of the night was the pig's tail appetizer.  This was finger licking good.  \n\nSecond time around, we opted to sit in the bar room and what a difference.  We were seated by the window, and the layout of the room meant there was more space between the tables.  Husband ordered bone marrow appetizer and steak main to share the with the kids.  I ordered the pig's tail as well duck ragout with poached egg appetizer, and pigs three way.  Everything is as we remember....Craigie that we loved: fresh ingredients, daring combination carried out with panache and sophistication.  Service this time was also more relaxed and friendly.\n\nSuggestion: pick seats at the bar room for space and sun (at least in the summer!) and avoid the degustation menu as it takes too long in a restaurant with no ambiance.  I hope the pig's tail stays on the menu for a long time."]
["Food was good, did the 8 course chefs tasting menu.  A little expensive for what you are given (8 course tasting plus a few drinks for 2 ran us 300 without tax or tip) but all  the courses were good tasting.  Favorite course was the scallop sashimi.  The service was quite slow, the water and the food came out in a reasonable amount of time but our main waitress was definitely not attentive in making sure we didn't want anymore cocktails..  All in all a good place to go but I'm not rushing back given the price and lack of service."]
['Unfortunately I did not have a great experience. The food was well cooked but it took FOREVER. 1 hour 45 minutes to get an entree and in the end I would not say it is better than most other seafood restaurants (I got bass). Went with 5 people and sat at a table in the dining room to the right near the bar- It was freezing. I was wearing my coat and the table next to me was wrapped in scarves- poorly insulated windows. We tried a ton of things- oysters, salad, pork, salmon, bass, chicken, and everything was good but not exceptional. There was a miscommunication with the wine and she thought we ordered a more expensive bottle than I said which they took off but the manager maybe? was basically snarling but our server (or one of the 6 people who frequented the table. a lot more waitstaff than other restaurants) was nice. I usually give places a couple of tries but it was my sisters third unhappy experience so it is probably not worth the time (dinner is 3 hours for the pre fix).']
['I don\'t even know what to say about this restaurant.  Is "everything is the best thing I\'ve ever eaten" too much?  Make sure to try the oysters and get a bottle of wine.']
['Flaming hot sugar crusted donut? You better get one. Seriously. Just go here for the donut. But also the pickles. Ahhhh the pickles. Mind blowing. Burger for brunch? Uh huh. Works perfectly. What about the mace ketchup? Again, home run. French Fries? Excellent. Crispy. Hot. French frygasm.  Excellent service, difficult parking (it IS decidedly Cambridgey), just a hair on the pricey side but pretty good for a fancy food brunch.  Coffee was just coffee. We did ask for the music to be turned down a bit. We were sat directly under a speaker. The waitress said "wow that is pretty loud."  She promptly restored the musics to a reasonable level to allow discussion without shouting.']
['Our waitress described everything as "beautiful." And she was right. \n\nAsk for the fleur de sel.']
['My wife and I went to Cragie On Main for our 1-year anniversary. To keep the review short and to the point, we had a wonderful experience. The staff was friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable and the ambiance of the restaurant was both refined and relaxed.\n\nWe had the 6-course tasting menu and our waiter first asked about dietary restrictions, allergies, and things we didn\'t like which was a first. This level of attention to detail was excellent and it stayed throughout our entire meal. We also had "mocktails" paired with our dishes that were excellent (we had to drive home, hence the \'mock\') - the amount of flavors that dovetailed perfectly with our food astounding.\n\nAnd, of course, the food itself was brilliant. The flavors were complex yet detailed enough that we could recognize individual ingredients without it all blending together. While each course seemed tiny, we were totally stuffed at the end. I can only imagine what a 10-course menu would\'ve been like (wheelbarrow to the car, please).\n\nOf course it\'s going to be a little pricey but Craigie On Main is an experience for any lover of fine food and drink. Excellent service paired with knowledgeable staff and fantastic food created an unforgettable evening for the both of us. We will definitely be coming back (and bringing friends)!']
["My lovely boyfriend took me here for my birthday recently.  It was a most pleasant experience.\n\nWe started off with cocktails.  I ordered the 1771 with cardamom and rhubarb and it was one of the top two cocktails I've ever had (the other being from Wildwood in Portland, OR).  The bf got a Coastal Cooler with blueberries, lavender, and lemon.  And let me say *thank you*, Craigie, for providing a spoon for his drink.  Delicious liquor soaked blueberries *should* be eaten but many establishments would unfortunately look down on fishing them out of the glass with a spoon.\n\nWe both got the prix fixe menu.  It's a good deal, (especially as you can order anything from the menu for your courses rather than a select few dishes) but in the future I will order less and enjoy it more.  While everything was good, both of us ended up enjoying our appetizers the best.  The amuse bouches were tasty, but not mind blowing.  His was fish something (the better of the two) and mine was prok something.  For appetizers he got the plate of terrines which were well chosen and tasty (and I'm not generally a huge fan) which came wit hsome very good toast (which he ate too much of and got too full-- beware!).  I got the house smoked wild king salmon sald with, among other things, lily bulbs.  It was amazing.  So simply, yet flavorful, clean, light-yet-filling, just perfect.  I would really go back and have this as my main course, possibly with a side.\n\nFor our entrees we both got the pork two ways.  The portions were small, but really didn't need to be any bigger.  It was very, very rich (especially after our previous courses)-- almost too rich to be enitrely enjoyable (it was very good, just a bit overwhelming!).\n\nFor desert I had the cornbread pain perdu.  It was tasty, but not extraordinary.  The bf had the three fruits sorbet which was refreshing and better than it sounded on the menu.\n\nThe service was very nice, no complaints there.  The decor is fine, but not that special (the building itself is average), though the lighting is nice.  It is definitely a good special occassion restaurant, but now I'd really like to go back jsut for a nice evening out when I'll be less tempted to over-indulge!"]
["This was my second time at Craigie, and I already can't wait to go back. It's just a pity my wallet and my waistline can't afford to go there more often. My memories of my first meal there are excellent ones, but vague, so I'll just focus on last night's meal.\n\nIt was my boyfriend's birthday. We wanted to have the pig's head for two, so I made sure to specify that when I made the OpenTable reservation. A couple of days before our reservation (they were closed the day before), I got a call to confirm, and the person I spoke to said that they had the pig's head in stock, but that she'd double-check the day of, to make sure we'd get what we wanted. She did indeed call back the afternoon of our reservation to say that yes, they had it. Nice!\n\nAlthough we wanted a nice cozy table for two to celebrate his birthday, both my boyfriend and I were intrigued by the idea of coming back sometime to sit at the counter surrounding the open kitchen, whose high energy and beautifully controlled chaos were attractive and exciting.\n\nThe waitress who served us was already aware of our desire for the pig's head, and immediately recommended the pig's tails as an appetizer. Granted, that sounded like Too Much Pig (and technically, it really was), but we couldn't resist the idea of literal nose-to-tail (or vice-versa) dining. We also got a riesling as recommended by the waitress. The bread that came to us shortly before the appetizer was good--made by Iggy's--but not anything to rave about. The pig tails were crispy on the outside, tender-fatty on the inside. They were perfectly accented by the nuoc cham, peanuts, and cilantro, which added an exotic note and a brightness to the rich meat and made it sing. The riesling did, indeed, pair perfectly with the richness of the pork and the southeast Asian flavors. \n\nThen came Mr. Pig. Please note--this is actually HALF a pig's head, not a whole one. It does not include tongue or brains, but does include an eyeball. It was accompanied by little pancakes (as for Peking duck), a boudin noir-hoisin sauce, and a pumpkin sambal, which was basically a salad of bean sprouts and pumpkin and herbs with toasted sesame oil and chili. My boyfriend took the first crisp square of scored pig skin, and I knew instantly I'd brought him to the right place. It was pork heaven. The meat was impossibly tender. The fat was meltingly soft and luscious. I'm someone who generally hates the texture of fat on meat, but this all seemed to blend into this sumptuous deliciousness that was irresistible. The skin was not at all tough or hard to chew, but was crisp and crackling like well-cooked bacon. So was the ear. I offered my boyfriend the snout, because it's a fairly cartilagenous piece, and I don't like that texture. He enjoyed it. We split the eyeball. After all that cooking, you couldn't really distinguish its texture from that of the meat and fat around it. The flavor was somewhat metallic, not unlike liver. Not at all unpleasant. The waitress was impressed with our fearless and enthusiastic deconstruction of Mr. Pig.\n\nDessert was whole wheat crepes with Macoun apples and butternut ice cream. The nuttiness of the whole wheat flour was perfect with the sweet apples, and the butternut ice cream had a wonderful salted-caramel note to it that tied everything together beautifully. It was autumn on a plate, complete with the ice cream as a farewell to summer. Delicious. When she brought the check, the waitress also brought a couple of nuggets of almonds held together by milk chocolate, a delicious last bite.\n\nThe service was wonderful. The waitress was extremely knowledgeable and attentive, and much more approachable than the staff in some other fine dining establishments. Her enthusiasm for the food and drink was obvious in how she described it, and she seemed genuinely happy about the pleasure we took in our meal. The energy of the place just seemed perfect. I felt like I was in a place where everyone and everything was working beautifully together. That sort of thing come through in the overall atmosphere of a restaurant, and can make the difference between a good experience and a great one. I look forward to coming back here again, to taste some of the other magical-sounding non-pork-related dishes."]
["Maybe I just waited too long and it could never live up to the hype, but I wasn't overly impressed.  My friends arrived before me and were seated early for our 8:30 res so that was good, altho they said the host was awkward, not sure why.  It's a crowded room and we sat by the walkway to the bathrooms and kitchen entry, so esp. busy.  I swear when I looked at the menu a few weeks ago deciding whether to eat here or at Salts, the prices weren't all uniform for apps/entrees/desserts.  Now it's  $17, $35 and $13 or prix fixe for $65 for 3 courses, like it's some sort of deal.  Isn't the prix fixe price supposed to entice you to go for all 3 courses with a little bit of a break?  Drinks took a while but were nice and some non overpriced wines by the glass. They gave us a choice of veg, meat or fish for the amuse and the duck was *very* pickled which I didn't like.  The grilled octopus was excellent but our app plates sat there for a long time when we were obviously done.  In addition, someone refilled a couple glasses of water at the table but not mine, the most empty one. The pork 3 ways was tasty except for one fatty preparation.  The tiny bit of greens on the side were nice. The pistachio/apricot dessert was decent but not worth breaking my $10 barrier for dessert rule.  Server was knowledgeable but not overly friendly.  I don't know, I'd give an extra 1/2 star but for more than $100 pp, I expect more."]
['Right after moving to Boston, I originally visited this restaurant thanks to a Food Network show that named the chicken at Craigie on Main as "one of the best thing I ever ate." I don\'t often agree with the food on that show, but this one I agree with a thousand times over - the chicken was out of this world! Note that the chicken is for two, so bring a food buddy with you. I haven\'t done this, but rumor has it you can eat at the bar and get a really awesome burger. I also heard they have pre-fixed themed days/dinners that you can check out. After having an amazing dinner, I tried Craigie on Main for brunch and was equally pleased (although the service this time wasn\'t as fabulous). Craigie on Main is really into pigs, so all pork-related dishes are both creative and delicious. We ordered two main dishes at brunch but couldn\'t help ourselves so we ended up with a side of pork belly. This is a Cambridge staple - you must go!']
["Amazing!  I'm big on eating at new restaurants whenever I go out, but I have to say this is a place I WILL repeat.  I went for brunch and have to go back for dinner.  It was great from the moment we walked in the door.  We were celebrating our anniversary, which I noted in our reservation, and most restaurants never reference those notes - but the moment we walked in the door, they were all about helping us celebrate the special occasion. \n\nThe ambiance is great - open kitchen, enough space between tables to give you a private convo, but close enough to check out everyone's dishes.\n\nStarted with their famous donut -read about it on yelp, so had to give it a try.  not a fan of donuts, but this was delicious!  The grits and flank steak were amazing.  The bloody mary very spicy - YUM.  \n\nGreat for a special occasion, date, or dinner with parents."]
['I heard good things about Craigie on Main from the Improper Bostonian top 100 restaurants/bars of Boston and have been talking about trying it out for months. The hostess were very hospitable. They found us a space at the bar and took our coats, but somewhat awkward in the process. We had to wait on the ramp (as they called "queue") for our seats at the bar as opposed to standing by the chairs, waiting for the couple to leave. Once we sat, it took a few minutes 5+ for the bartender to greet us and ask for drink orders. He (Jared) seemed nervous as first but quickly warmed up and was also very accommodating. He offered us a variety of wines to taste. I was impressed by his knowledge of the wines, types location, grapes, etc. \nBrussel sprouts and beef burger were very yummy, complex flavors, well cooked, fresh and in addition, all ingredients harvested from Mass and NE farms -keepin it local (A+++ in my book) \nAfter dinner we ordered the Ardoise (sage infused vodka gimlet) and the Lawnchair Observation (mojito with ginger beer sub for soda). The latter is not listed on the menu so be sure to ask Jared for it!!\nIt\'s absolutely worth giving the place a shot if you\'re in Central. If you\'re not in the mood for food, you have to at least stop in for a drink, which were unmatched to any cocktail I\'ve ever had!!']
['So this place was fine.  However, when factoring in price , we dropped $350 for 2 people, and the fact that I spend $175 a person, well, never, except if it\'s my 15 year anniversary then it get\'s the two star and considered one, because at that price you should be wowed.  For the particulars, we arrived with no reservation because we just got out of the house and started driving, we usually end up eating at the bar because,well, that\'s how we roll pathetic planning.  We first went by Highland Kitchen but it was mobbed but the decided to head over to Main Street because I know some stuff has been popping over there.\n\nArriving with no reservations, hostess and a waitress who was helping us with drinks on the ramp were super.  Then got seats at the bar.  Cocktails, excellent. We went for the 6 course tasting menu because we thought that would knock our socks off, and thought, hell I could either get that electric guitar I\'ve been pining for,forever, our do the foodie splurge.  I like to cook and have been all over the Boston food map, from Hammersley\'s, to Rialto, #9 Park, to the blue room when Frankenthaller was still there, etc, so I was fired up to be here because of the accolades but I cannot imagine that the chef/owner was in the kitchen that night.\n\n1st Course was presented as the Amuse Bouch,that I thought would not be the first course, but it was, thought it would have been a cool way to start, in the sense, you ordered the Six but I\'m really going to give you the six and a half but was not to be.  It was fine.  I believe it was Swordfish collar, marinated, as a crudo, some smoked/cured salmon and some caviar,single bites, the swordfish was most tasty.  Second was blue fin tuna with some melon coins, good/buttery, melon nice foil but a little sinew left on the tuna made for an extra chew.  Then the striper with daikon broth and ribbon of daikon, fish was cooked perfectly,skin was left on, love fish skin,  but not this fish skin, it was rubbery, like it got poached, personally crisp it skin side down in oil, be done with it, but rubbery, this seems really wrong.\nNext was rye flour pasta with boudin noir,  you would think the flavor profile would be good, something you want to be impressed with, but it was flat, no earthy anything from the boudin, and,for me, jury is still out on whole grain pasta.  We then had venison 2 ways, 2 or 3 slices of sausage, 2 or 3 small coins of meat, with what appeared to be and tasted like, I don\'t maybe mild Sirachha  type sauce in the middle decorating the plate.  The palate cleanser was the nicest suprise, apple/celery sorbet, apple on the front of the pallete, celery on the back, really nice.  It was served with the equivalent of fresh string cheese.  I don\'t really get it, but it tasted good.  2 deserts, that is one plate each of different deserts, the apple with crepe and sour milk ice cream was dissappointing,the crepe, seemed again of whole grain, and tasted like the whole wheat roll ups I use for the kids to get them to eat something health, the apple scattered on top, again fine.  My wife had something with chocolate, salt was sprinkled on it, pretty good, but seems hard to screw with good chocolate.   The bread had the it was made fresh in the morning but you got here late so deal with it \'bite\' to the crust.  We waited something like 25 minutes between 2 courses.\n\n My expectations were high, at this caliber of restaraunt I would think that A) Flavor Profiles would be awesome something you could not do at home, this did not happen. B) Presenation/preparation would be flawless, this did not happen.\n\nI really wanted to love the restaraunt and experience but $175 per person, $350 all in, I know of a variety of restaraunts that would have been better at half the price so just disappointed.  My guess one or two things off the menu and the bar burger would have been much better and expected so much more from the "Craigie Experience" tasting menu,and if that\'s the experience, sorry, don\'t want to experience it again.  would rather have the used stratocaster.']
['Went there for a double date and not that impressed. We did the tasting menu and it was all right. Nothing mind blowing. The waiters were friendly but our main waitress was a saleswoman. She was pushy. For example, my husband wanted the prix fix menu, but since the other three wanted the tasting menu, she said the chef wouldn\'t allow it. It was everybody or nothing which made kind of sense because the food would come in different times, but clearly not "whatever the customer wants." motto. We went for the tasting menu, but after three courses there was a point we were waiting for 20 minutes being completely ignored. Two out of the four desserts were good, the other two edible. Overpriced 4 people $700, no bottles of wine, just drinks and I did not drink because I\'m pregnant. Not worth it.  Do not recommend it.']
['Wow!  This place continues to amaze me.  Be ready to splurge a bit but it is worth it!\nMy particular favorites are the bone marrow and the oysters.  I think the appetizers really are the highlights of their menu.  The burger, only served at the bar, are really good.   Great service.  Open kitchen format so you can see all the hustle and bustle they make to create these fantastic dishes.  Great for dates and dinner with close friends.']
['Thank you, Craigie on Main, for doing everything right. I now trust Tony Maws with my life, and would consider making him the executor of my estate.']
["Visited this establishment a while back and thought it had a really nice atmosphere and great service but unfortunately, my food experience was a little disappointing.  At least half of the dishes I had on my tasting menu were not cooked well or were underwhelming.  \n\nI had really looked forward to the six course tasting here, having heard so much about it.  In many ways, I was impressed.  We had technically more than just six courses if you count the lovely jasmine infused panna cottas that were complementary.  \n\nI may have had an irregular experience but tastings aren't things I can afford to try multiple times at the same place if my experience the first time was mediocre.  \n\nI really loved the salad and desserts but am terribly disappointed by the pork belly.  It was unbelievably salty!  The same can be said for the other meat dishes and makes me wonder if I just got the bottom of the pot (they did say at first that they ran out).\n\nAside from the meats, I did thoroughly enjoy the unique flavor and pairings of the other dishes, but being a meat lover, not having a well flavored meat dish put quite the damper on my evening."]
["I had the six course tasting menu paired with a Bandol, absolutely the best meal I've ever had!  Chef Maws is brilliant. I can't wait to return."]
["Hands down the BEST burger I've ever had, and I've had many a burger... (It's not on the menu and you have to order it at the bar..)\n\nThe burger itself is a houseblend of different meats, the bun is a house made, delightfully sesame-seedful bun and the bf couldn't get enough of the fries and homemade sauce... It's a little pricey at 18$ a burger, but SO worth it.\n\nWe also started with some sort of pigs feet dish with onion rings on top, DELISH but a little messy. Kudos to the bartender who told us it was ok to dig in with our hands, even at this super classy establishment. \n\nALSO, this is a reservations kind of place, though we showed up unannounced (and dressed down) and the hostess was extremely accommodating and got us a spot at the bar after a short wait.."]
["Good food, but none of it blew me away. Uneven service - it took forever for cocktails to arrive (after we had to ask for the confusing, pretentious cocktail menu instead of getting it upon sitting), but apps. came too fast because we'd barely started the cocktails. Service evened out after that.\n \nTempura soft-shell crab tasted like it could have come from a clam shack deep fryer. And foam on every other dish - really? Isn't that kind of 2002?"]
['Over priced, tiny servings, slow service, over wrought food that is surprisingly forgettable and the bizarre flock of servers rotating among themselves leaving you wondering if anyone is really serving you makes this place a sad disappointment. Their sense of grandeur is laughable as if we are the "blessed" to have been allowed to graze at the precious COM tables. Their supposed love of food just does not come through.  A disappointing miss.']
['Went there for dinner on a Friday night, food was well prepared and exquisite. I had goose liver pate for first course and trout for main course; both were tasty but I wish they had more seafood selections for main course. The chief seemed nice but our server felt cold compared to other restaurants of similar scale. We ordered the half bottle champagne but next time I will definitely go with their specialty drinks. Overall it was a very nice experience and I would come back again.']
["Say Hello To Holly WHo is the most awesome server In a long while.\nThe food, French Influenced as it is-- is not my style. But that does not mean I don't appreciate it. I loved certain aspects of all the dishes I won't explain here. Just go there. Say Hello to Holly. The drinks great. The food they use wisely is the best you can find for many miles."]
['Craigie on Main is truly a treat and one of the finest restaurants I have ever dined at.  Chef Tony Maws is truly deserving of his James Beard Award nomination (I cant believe he did not win) \nI recommended getting there a little early to have a house inspired cocktail.  The bar is superior then most much like that of Drink in S. Boston. The menu is very interesting and changes slightly daily. I suggest going with a tasting menu the chef is truly a master at his craft and all meals were excellent.  I had and enjoyed the grilled Spanish octopus followed but the flat iron steak. Lastly for dessert I had a peanut butter parfait paired with a wonderful dessert wine perfectly as suggested from the chef. Overall the experience was fantastic and will definitely come back.']
["Been here twice now, and all I can say is I love this place. The decor feels cozy, not stuffy like most of the other high-end places. The view into the kitchen when you walk in is exciting and intriguing, not flashy. Drinks are delicious, food is spectacular, but what I love most about this place is the service. Wait staff is ALWAYS relaxed and happy to answer your questions, never felt pressured, condescended, or age-discriminated (I'm a younger guy). \n\nI'm looking forward to whatever next major event will bring me back to Craigie On Main, it never fails to impress me."]
["high expectations, all (nearly) met. with minor flaws easily forgiven as flavors, quality and warm service made up. went for the 10-course chef's menu with a request that grilled spanish octopus be included. sat at chef's table(Jeremy K. said) for a close-up of the best reality show in town. this is one busy, busy kitchen. and tony maws one hardworking dude. chers amis français...ne manquez pas de visiter ici pour le meilleur goût de Boston."]
['The GF and I went to Craigie for her 21st birthday.  We had put in a reservation about a month ahead with no issue.  When we arrived the hostess told us it would be couple minutes so we went to the bar to grab a drink.  While the bar area can get a little crowded and is a bit hard to navigate, the entire staff does an excellent job to make sure that you are being served no matter where you are standing.  We put in an order for a Sazerac and a Hendricks Gin Gimlet.  Within a minute of ordering drinks a hostess came and told us that there was opening at the Chef\'s table, which we jumped all over.\n\nWe were promptly sat at the Chef\'s table, a granite four-top that is literally next to the kitchen.  Nothing separates you from the kitchen staff, no glass window or anything, and it\'s amazing.  It\'s like dinner and a movie, but better, and yummier.  Our waiter asked if we wanted anything to drink and I just mentioned that we had put in an order for a couple drinks over at the bar.  Within minutes, a hostess came by with the drinks and comped both of them because of the wait.  It really wasn\'t too long at all, but we were thrilled with their attention to detail.\n\nWe ordered the 6 course tasting menu and told the waiter that we ate everything, no dietary restrictions.  Awesome, we are in for a ride.  We started off with a amuse bouche of three types of seafood.  Squid noodles, smoked halibut, and a crispy potato and cod fritter.  Each one supposedly got more intense, but I honestly fell in love with the squid noodles, best taste so far.  First course comes out, Halibut ceviche with lemon oil and dehydrated corn powder.  Best dish so far.  Second course, crispy frogs legs with chorizo, best dish so far.  Rabbit and chile stuffed pasta, best dish so far.  Tony Maws and his staff outdid themselves dish after dish.  Veal sweetbread, duck, sheepsmilk cheesecake, anise ice cream.  God, I don\'t even know.  We ordered another round of drinks off their cocktail menu, and they came promptly and were amazing.  Extremely creative, well balanced, and using house-made ingredients.\n\nThe meal was fantastic, there is no doubt about it, there wasn\'t a single under or overcooked item, all the tastes, flavors, colors, they all popped individually together.  It was a goddamn symphony in my mouth.\n\nThe kitchen was amazing.  Getting to see how they worked together, how they encouraged, chided, and worked so efficiently was amazing.  plating was amazing, Tony manages his staff extremely well, they are a well-oiled machine.  He even served us one of the dishes and checked in from time to time.\n\nCraigie is amazing, it\'s not a meal, it\'s an experience, the best one you can have. Beyond the food and drink, the service is impeccable.  Everyone on the floor shares an equal responsibility to the patrons outside of their own specific job.  All the waiters wait on everyone, the hostesses wait and serve drinks, the managers do too.  Attention to detail and perfection are standard for them.  There is no above and beyond for them, if they can do anything better, they do it because it should be standard.\n\nCraigie has ruined my life.  My lunches are boring, my dinners are boring, hell even my mother\'s home-cooked Indian food is boring.  Nothing matches Craigie and my taste buds constantly are telling me, "GO BACK!".']
['The food is great, changes pretty often, with great ingredients. The service is I guess the bad point of the restaurant. For instance, we waited 10 minutes to get a napkin... Another time, my meal arrived 15 minutes after my friend. However, the restaurant reacts well in this kind of circumstances: we left with a 50-dollar voucher, a great way to be reconciled with a great place in Cambridge.']
["Went there for brunch. We needed reservations 1 week in advance (although it was close to v-day). I had fruit salad to start. It was filled with different types of fruit and mint - delicious and regressing. My boyfriend has the donut because it was voted best in the US. It was different from regular donuts and delicious. I then had the best omelet I've ever had in my entire life! The eggs were perfect, the portion was just right, and the balance of cheese, spinach, and herbs was perfect!"]
['Overrated, overpriced and uneven.    Service was subpar given the price level of this place.   Our latte arrived filled to overflowing with the saucer filled with spilled coffee.   Server took no notice.  After my 70 year old mother used her napkin to sop it up, I finally had to ask server about it.   "Do you want me to take that?" he said, pointing to the soaked blob of napkin.   "Uh, yeah, duh....".     Nobody came to refill coffees throughout meal...unacceptable at $5 a cup.     Doughnut with cajeta was totally overrated....not "hot" as advertised but only slightly warm, cajeta sauce was bland.   You could have warmed up a Dunkin Doughnut in the microwave with some caramel sauce and had something that tasted just as good.   A $1.25 malasada in Honolulu baked fresh and piping hot puts this $5 doughnut to shame.    Roasted vegetable plate tasted fine, but they were a pretty meager portion worth of veggies with literally one tablespoon of egg for $18.     Nobody asked us how the the food was throughout the brunch.   The food is made of decent quality ingredients and tastes fine, but given the meh service, you\'re just paying an awful lot for the fancy factor.   I\'ve had same quality food at Flour, etc. for half the price.']
['Fantastic.  Amazing.  All the superlatives.\n\nTop notch chef and service.']
['I recommend for appetizers the pate trio (taste testing ecstasy) and the mushroom ragout (meaty and satisfying with generous portions). For entrees, we also had the chicken with stuffed sausage and the venison (though my partner was more interested in stealing pieces from my chicken dish.) We also had the chocolate tort and a butterscotch dessert with the imaginative and ingenious miso ice cream. \n\nWhen I think about my dinner at Craigie on Main, the first word to come to mind was "heavenly." There\'s a character in the show "Coupling" who zones out when she has to hear something extremely unpleasant. She goes to her "happy place," a misty, ethereal location in her mind equipped with a string quartet, which represents satisfaction, calmness, and carefree delight. Well, the memory of eating Craigie\'s chicken entree is now my "happy place." If I\'m feeling anxious on an airplane or in a dentist chair--I just invoke my memory of eating at Craigie\'s and I am filled with inner joy again.  Yes, that is the power of Craigie on Main.\n\nThe chicken with stuffed chicken sausage was succulent, buttery, delicious perfection. It was paired with the smoothest and best mashed potatoes and gravy I\'ve ever had, with some sweet onion slices. I did not know it was possible to infuse chicken with such rich taste. Did they massage this chicken for three hours in the kitchen? I have almost given up eating chicken meat, because it was always so dry and bland. My faith is now restored. Or at least, I will not eat any other chicken except made by Craigie...because the act of chewing any other chicken is a waste of energy. One bite of this succulent piece of meat is worth ten years of all other chicken eating experiences.\n\nAfter this meal, I spent days raving about it to everyone who would listen. They all thought I was a little crazy with the proselytizing. But then I mentioned Craigie on Main to a friend, and his eyes bugged out as he exclaimed "OH MY GOD--THE CHICKEN!" I knew then by the enthusiasm on his face that he too had experienced chicken nirvana at Craigie\'s. \n\nYes, the place was pricey, but I support their mission of seeking local, sustainable food. The service was excellent and cheerful. I came in jeans and a sweater, and felt very comfortable. It was not hoity-toity at all. The atmosphere was similar to Henrietta\'s Table.']
["I've been here a handful of times for both brunch and dinner. And the food is always prepared and plated very nicely and tastes even better. When i eat out i usually like to get what I already know is good. And their pork trio (or pork 3 ways... i'm not sure what they call it anymore) is always my main course. This one day however I was already pretty full and left half my dish uneatten. And the meal itself isn't terribly large, so our server must have taken notice that I didn't finish my meal. The manager came over specifically to ask us how our evening went and asked me if there was anything I didn't like about my dish because I didn't finish it and if there was something else she could offer me in replacement. That one small gesture made me realize DAMN THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!"]
['I won\'t bore you with another essay about this place (you can read those, below), but here are the highlights: \n- I had the 10 course tasting menu, and it was really more of an "eating" menu. The entire dinner took nearly four hours, and I was wonderfully full at the end of it. This definitely isn\'t a tasting menu where you\'re going to feel like getting a burger afterwards.\n- My date had the pescetarian menu, which had similar portions (and was also awesome-tasting! I would have shared my lamb, but, you know... pescetarian) They were incredibly accommodating, and asked us, not just when making the reservations, but before we started the meal if we had any dietary restrictions. \n- I mentioned to the server that I wish my local grocery store carried cock\'s comb (you know the red flappy thing at the top of rooster\'s heads) because it was so delicious, and he gave me the address for a local butcher I could get it from! All the staff were incredibly helpful, funny, took time to talk and answer questions, while not being intrusive. \n- Ninja wine and water-pouring skills. Seriously, I didn\'t even notice them doing it, but my glass was full the entire time. \n- Amazing, amazing food. But that one should be obvious. \n- The champagne was great!']
["Came here for Sunday brunch, as dinner res are hard to get on even relatively short notice (unless you like 9:30pm dinner). The donut is mandatory with brunch, everything else we tried was excellent, from variations on breakfasty classics to a yummy burger. Menu constantly changing, excellent ingredients, good eatin'!!!"]
['Craiggie on main. \nSuch potential, such a great reputation. Was I expecting too much??\nProbably. I love their whole genre; local, nose to tail, a true respect for food. Perhaps a chefs dream of a restaurant. My brother in law suggested we go, he owns 2 of the best restaurants in his area and has been recognized as one of the best chefs in New England. I have to tell you this man has true talent! Not to play my own horn but I have been a chef for 30 years and have been teaching culinary arts for ten. I reluctantly say that yelp has never been the end all! The soap box that so many use to just give themselves a forum is usually self serving, how ever I do use it to discover new places, and trust it with a bit of reservation. \nNow on to my first review on yelp. \nOver 700 reviews of craggie on main. I do believe they are mostly positive and I hope deservedly so! Unfortunately my experience was not as fortunate as those who have posted before me. My experience should not reflect the astounding bill but only express the the service and food. \nOur waiter and his back waiter were terrific! We were taken on a journey of exploration and perfection! So yea we were set up for a lot! The first of of our 6 course tasting menu were absolutely fantastic. The amuse bouche hit it perfectly with our " bubbles". The sturgeon with pickeetoe crab risotto was to die for! Well my wife says not so. Then um well it kind of fell to pieces. \nWe were sort of on an island where bread an butter were our dinner. Then came the venison two ways. One was seared but actually raw, kind of like really great bluefin tuna at a sushi bar but man that\'s just wrong, raw veni? The other way had a beautiful name but was supposed to be like a tureen or a pate or just a piece of sausage. Whoops! Got that totally wrong. Sawdust meatball is the way I describe it! \nThen one of the dessert courses...we left with one of the bitterest/saltiest nastiest mouthfuls ever! Kind of a bad finish. \nOh wait, the bill was $298 dollars! Really? A bad finish!\nHow do you possibly think you can get away with that?\nTell you what, change your skewed sense of value and culinary respect! I do appreciate your "concern" for my comments after dinner because I was honest (I never complain) but what you really need to do is stop riding your reputation and get back to business.']
["There's a reason this is repeatedly cited as one of the best restaurants in the Boston area.  It really is that good.\n\nI've been to Craigie twice, and both times I've had the 10 course tasting menu with wine pairings selected by the staff.  Both meals were spectacular.\n\nThe service is consistently excellent.  Every employee with whom we interacted was knowledgeable, courteous, and professional."]
["My fiance and I were looking for a fine dining experience that we could enjoy comfortably (which in our life, means in jeans) for his birthday. Craigie's was superb - everything we were looking for and then some.\n\nThe ambiance is great - lots of energy radiating from the kitchen up front, not too close to the table next to you (which in Cambridge is refreshing!). The waitstaff was obviously impeccably trained - friendly, professional, knowledgeable about the menu, and completely dedicated towards making sure you have the perfect meal. The cocktails were sensational, and most used fresh herbs and fruits. \n\nObviously, the best part was the food. Every ingredient was obviously fresh, and menu was really creative. The portion sizes were perfect - not so much you were overwhelmed, but not so little you were upset to be dishing out the money for it. The food was beautifully served, and absolutely delectable. I actually closed my eyes during certain bites to allow myself a moment to savor what I was tasting. \n\nWe will definitely be returning to Craigie's for a future celebration!"]
["Went to Craigie again. This time for the burgers. Oh boy! It's definately worth the hype!"]
['This place is good, not great.  The seating is very cramped -- they pack the diners in like sardines, and do a very high volume of business.  While the wait staff is more than capable of keeping up with the crush, I\'m not sure that the kitchen can meet the demands of the busy dining room.  Lots of little missteps in our meal -- undercooked six minute egg, which made the texture of a "ragout" a bit off-putting; forgotten razor clams in the swordfish entree; missing ingredients in a couple of the desserts...  Slapdash execution at what is supposedly a "five star" dining institution.  Nonetheless, the flavors of the food here are thoughtful and sometimes challenging; I would go back... Just not on a Friday or Saturday.']
["Oh my oh my. How I loved eating at Craigie On Main! I haven't eaten at all the establishments in Boston, but holy cow - this place has got to be one of the best in the area. Food quality and service was spot on, and prices were decent. Must eat here if you visit Boston!\n\nIf you have a party of four or less, ask to be seated ringside. You get front and center bar-like seating, looking directly into the kitchen. You can watch the kitchen drama unfold...If you're taking advantage of the seating/views, and watching intently, you probably won't have the most calm/peaceful dinner. Sitting so close, you get caught up in the hustle-bustle kitchen atmosphere. I loved it!!\n\nWe got the 6 course chefs menu - which really meant 8 or 9 dishes.\n1. trio of squid spaghetti, tuna tartare, and sardine. Beautiful presentation, delicious.\n2. Hamachi salad - 2 small slivers of hamachi with avocados, mango, and special sauce. Perfection!\n3. Seafood sauasage in some type of soupy liquid. Sausage was just ok, soup addicting. I could've done without this course.\n4. Softshell crab with fennel or shallots - delicious! Half a softshell crab standing tall, adorned with tiny basil sprouts\n5. Sweatbread with asparagus, poached egg, and spring flowers - my favorite dish. It was so incredibly beautiful, especially when you break the yolk. Work of art, and delicious to boot.\n6. Squab - tasted like red meat, delicious. I saw the head chef plate this, one vegetable at a time. wow!\n7. Panna cotta - OMG. I lied. This was my favorite dish. Ever so tiny, but packed with flavor. There are two flavors - jasmine and roobius (sp?). The jasmine was heavenly.\n8. Desserts: gingerbread with young ginger ice cream, peanut butter cookie with peanut butter ice cream, seasonal fruit crumble with tarragon ice cream, olive oil chocolate mousse. Desserts were all solid...but nothing stood out like the panna cotta one. Olive oil chocolate mousse was really interesting. I wouldn't crave it, but it tasted unique.\n\nSo ya...I'd recommend this place hands down. Price, with tax/tip - around $100 I think. Not bad for such a great dining experience...almost 3.5 hours I think :)"]
["ONE OF THE MOST FULFILLING MEALS OF OUR (MY G/F AND I) LIVES!!! My adventure that lead me to Craigie On Main started with the realization that my g/f's birthday was coming up in a couple weeks. This past winter we traveled to Paris and dined at a place called the Hidden Kitchen (a private dinner club hosted at a chef's apartment). We were treated to a 10 course tasting menu that was like nothing we have ever tried.  We are not foodies at all but going through that experience in Paris opened our eyes to what food could be when it is prepared with the skill and love of a true chef. Anyways, I tell you all this because when I was looking for a place to take my g/f for her birthday I immediately thought about a classy restaurant that had a chef's table so that we could see all the action and relive our time in Paris. Surprisingly there aren't as many of these in Boston as you might think.  Most of them have tables that accommodated 10-12 person parties so they would not rent them out for just 2 people. When it came down to it the restaurants I was deciding between were Craigie On Main, L'Espalier, and Menton.  All 3 have wonderful food and service but I just thought that the cozy feel that Craigie seemed to have suited us more then the ritzy/dry/uptight atmospheres that the other 2 places seemed to offer. Before I evened showed up for our reservations the staff was VERY helpful in making my g/f's night as special as possible.  I had flowers ordered and send to the restaurant earlier in the day and they had them set up on the ringside chef's bar (looking right into the kitchen) before we arrived.  They also, helped me pick out a great champagne and had that accompany the flowers.  A birthday card signed by the chef was also there. I couldn't ask for anything more from the tremendously helpful staff.  We decided to go with The Craigie Experience (six course tasting menu) because we were feeling a little adventurous piggy backing on our Paris experience.  We did inform the server that we did not want to be served any organs meats but that was our only restriction.  They had no problem with that and once again were very accommodating. I won't go through every dish but some of the dishes included: smoked sashimi salmon, sashimi geoduck, bass, pork ragu (my favorite), and pork belly (my g/f's favorite).  Once we had our 6 courses of food we thought it was over but then we were also served 4 more dessert dishes that included fresh fruit sorbets, a funnel cake creation, panna cotta, a sweet ginger drink, and finally some homemade chocolates. Needless to say we were STUFFED. The presentations of every dish were great and each server (even the head chef) made sure we knew what we were actually eating. Through out the dinner, which was about 3 hours, almost every employee came up to my g/f and told her happy birthday and that just showed me what a warm and inviting place this really was.  All the reviews I read about this place raved about the food but the service was just as good! Overall, this was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had and I have to give great thanks to Craigie for making me look like a king in my g/f's eyes! If you are reading this you need to go eat here and see for yourself what great food can taste like.\n\nP.S. during dinner we could not keep our eyes off the burgers that were being made in front of us.  We are defiantly going back to get one of those because they looked AMAZING!!!!\n\nP.S. during dinner we could not keep our eyes off the burgers that were being made in front of us.

["Truly a superb meal.  I'd list recommendations here, but all the things I tasted were excellent.  The grilled octopus really stood out though.\n\nMy only reservation in recommending this restaurant is that the staff is overwhelmingly pretentious and self-righteous at times.  They rarely miss an opportunity to demonstrate that they know far more than you do about wine, beef, local foods, etc.  They're right though, so I didn't mind so much."]
["We were visiting Boston from Los Angeles.  As we do consider ourselves foodies we had to go to Craigie On Main while visiting the city.  We made reservations far in advance and when we arrived we got a great seat over looking the kitchen.  Because we had a late lunch (which was poor planning on our part) we weren't going to be doing the 8 course meal.  When our server came over and we ordered, one of us got the three course meal, a few of us ordered just entrees and a couple of us shared a handful of appetizers.  Throw that in with multiple rounds of wine and 4 desserts we were well on our way.  The snobby experience we had w/ the waiter was almost unbelievable.  When we told him that we weren't doing the tasting he pretty much turned over our table to a food runner.  We were staring at empty plates that would not get cleared.  It was a pretty awful experience as we weren't ordering the large meal because we were cheap but rather not starving......\n\nAside from that the food was good but nothing to write home about.  We have such amazing restaurants in LA that I guess we expected more from this hyped up restaurant.  The service honestly could of turned us off to where there was no way we could enjoy the food.  All and all the food was decent, certainly creative but nothing that is so memorable and outstanding you savor every bite good.\n\nLastly, since one of my girlfriends is such a foodie, she was hoping the James Beard awarded chef could come by our table since he had been dropping off food for other tables all night.  The server pretty much laughed and said he was far too busy for that.  Overall this was a pretty disappointing dinner but I guess our expectations are just too high.........."]
["My kind of place! We started with an amuse bouche: the duck prosciutto on a bed of cheese with some type of a delectable compote.. next came the grilled spanish octopus, which was as tender as could be. The sauce was incredible- the lemon zest was the icing on top. I was surprised to find that the entrees were substantial in portion. The pork three ways- the pork belly, the rib, and the suckling confit- were each so tasty and aesthetically pleasing. For dessert we had the sour milk pannacotta which came with pralines and a jam- maybe fig? can't wait to go back for the tasting menu... in a couple months since the bill is not the easiest on the wallet."]
['Enough has been written about this place, so I\'ll keep it short. It was my first time trying pig\'s tail, but it won\'t be the last. Incredibly delicious. I had the famous burger and it was even better than I thought it could be. I\'m not sure it should legally be considered a burger, however. It fits more appropriately in the "orgasmic meat sandwhich" category. It\'s jsut not fair to compare it to other burgers...']
["A friend visiting from the west coast took me here for a full tasting menu. Because I don't eat meat, but I do eat fish, dairy, and eggs, the chef accommodated my particular diet and made me a custom version of the tasting menu. The wine pairings were excellent, the service was exquisite, and the cocktails were simply divine and very creative. The food itself was very impressive and delicious. I would eat here again in a heartbeat, and wish I could afford to eat here regularly. Will have to wait for some very special occasion to justify the high prices, but in my experience, if you have the money to eat here, it's worth it. A memorable experience."]
["Wow!  Best dining experience of my life?  It's close!  Two of us, and we each tried the six course chef's tasting menu (which seems more like eight or nine courses when you add dessert in).  INCREDIBLE!  I really wish I could remember more of what we were seved, but there was just so much and each small portion was loaded with delicious ingredients and mosaics of flavor.  Stand outs include the squid noodles (amazing!), fried oysters, two types of incredible fish that just melted in our mouths, and the sour cream panna cotta with brown butter powder and banana puree.  The brown butter powder deserves a sentence or two...have you heard of it?  I hadn't...it was like eating magic!  Looks like dust and instantly turns from powder to liquid to gas in your mouth.  I don't know what else to say about it: magic!\n\nSo the food was terrific, but what really made the night was the service.  These people clearly love working at Craigie and that made me love eating there.  I've never seen such dedicated and passionate staff, and I'm including Disney cast members and Ritz employees.  What kind of training program must chef/owner Tony Maws have??  \n\nA stunning night.  Thank you for the experience!"]
["Took a friend for her 40th, party of four.  Reservation for 9:30pm, kinda late but plenty of others being seated so we expected this is normal for Craigie - more on that later.  Service was friendly, but rather casual, a little snotty even.  They were pushing the multi-course tasting menu, but we opted for the prix fixe.\n\nThe bread basket was cold!  Come on, you're charging us a second mortgage for this experience, bust out some warm bread! \n\nI inquired about the famous the burger - sorry, can't have it at the tables - but the guy seated 2 feet away from me at the bar is however allowed to stuff his face full of burger.  The chef doesn't think it jives aesthetically in the 'dining room'.  Okay...  In the same breath, the server suggest the pig's tail, cool, we'll have that.  BTW - he suggests we should eat it with our hands...  Eating a burger offends his aesthetic senses but licking my fingers after eating pig's tail is acceptable??  Seriously... \n\nThe food was good, but not James Bear winner phenomenal.  Maybe our expectations were too high, maybe they had an off night.  Doesn't matter, you're selling yourself as a uber-special place so it should be uber-special in every way.  The highlight was the brussel sprouts dish we ordered as a side.  \n\nWorst of all, the servers completely forgot about us after the main course was delivered.  Everybody was too busy cashing out and cleaning up for the night around us.  Hello!!  Still sitting here, could use a drink, and the dessert would be nice!  \n\nAgain, the experience was somewhat ruined by the service.  Definitely not worth the money.  You can do about the same for a lot less down the street at randevouz."]
["Unbelievable.\n\nThere's not much more to say.  Excellent service, lovely atmosphere, amazing food.  \n\nWe celebrated our first wedding anniversary here in December.  We enjoyed the ten course tasting menu and a fantastic bottle of wine... and spent soooooo much money.  I couldn't have been more pleased and every penny was worth it.\n\nI would absolutely go back."]
["I travel a lot and on a recommendation from Yelp, visited this location for dinner. OUTSTANDING!!  Service was great.  Atmosphere was good. The meal was incredible - had the coveted and much talked about hamburger. BEST hamburger and homemade condiments I've ever tasted.  Had a side of brussel sprouts baked with duck fat..YUM!  Overall, one of the best meals I've had in Boston.  Pricetag for the evening - very very reasonable.  wow."]
["You have to understand that we're both students.  We eat out maybe once a month, and sometimes once every six weeks.  And after that meal, we tighten our belts and will eat pancakes and eggs until the budget evens out again.  Now, keep in mind that our meal out is usually somewhere nice, somewhere worth it.  We'd of course read about Craigie Street Bistro, and then Craigie on Main for years before coming here.  As a rule, I choose the restaurant, but he chose this time for some reason.  \n\nThe only bad thing about Craigie on Main is that I have eaten NO WHERE ELSE since we first came here.  We now come once a month, and it's the best day of the month, let me tell you.  We really enjoy the bar area, where we can order the burger if our cholesterol can stand it and watch the bartenders whip up delicious, unique concoctions. \n\nThe service is unbeatable:  Once, they were thirty minutes beyond our reservation in seating us, and took extra care to make sure that the meal was memorable and special.  Their system is noteworthy.  Everyone working there is so professional, friendly, unpretentious, and seriously into food.  They are genuinely excited when you like what you're eating, they will engage you if you want to know about your food, yet they give you space if you are more interested in your dinner conversation than whether the ramps were sourced from Massachusetts or New Hampshire.  Once, we were examining a knife because we liked its design, and, a minute later, a server clandestinely replaced the knife, assuming we had seen a spot or something.  Also, we asked about the delicious marinated cherries that had arrived in a Sidecar we'd ordered, and we heard all about how the cherries were marinated and were given a few more to try.  It's these little gestures that really make you feel special when you're eating there.\n\nWe've eaten in the dining room and the bar, for tasting menus (I have had both the vegetarian and non-veg tastings), a la carte, brunch, and bar food.  Admittedly, I am not a picky eater, but I can honestly say that I will eat anything put in front of me at this restaurant.  The chef (Tony Maws) can make anything taste good.  The food is absolutely transporting, and I have tried such exciting combinations with the freshest ingredients.  I can't even tell you what to order because everything I've tried I've really enjoyed.  I would go in with an open mind (smoked smelt with squid ink?) and an empty belly.  You will come away stuffed, happy, and excited about food in Boston."]
["the best bad experience i've ever had\n\ni've eaten in the dining room at craigie a few times, usually the 'chef's whim', but more often i take a place at the bar and order from its more modestly priced menu.  the food is fantastic, no doubt, and many fellow yelpers have offered helpful and articulate reviews of it here.  but, rather than further extolling its many culinary virtues, i want only to attest to the staff's attentiveness, and to highlight their genuine concern for their guests.  \n\nlast night, after waiting an hour or more for a seat at the ever-busy bar, a friend and I watched in horror as our seats were given, presumably accidentally, to some guests who had arrived after us.  this sort of injustice, however petty, provokes in even the most level-headed a sense of indignation, and stirs powerful emotions.  this was an inauspicious beginning to what i hoped would be a pleasantly indulgent evening.  \n\nthe series of sincere apologies that followed actually made me feel like the staff was genuinely concerned about my experience.  while we waited for the next open seat at the bar they offered us a spot with a view of the kitchen, brought us drinks (no charge), and something tasty (again, no charge).  the rest of the night--the carefully crafted drinks, the outstanding food, and the engaging conversation--was remarkable, but the point i want to make here is that the people at craigie, the gracious hosts, the smiling wait staff, and the capable bartenders, are what make the place distinctive."]
['Had the "chef\'s whim" tasting at Craige, a most incredible deal. They close mondays, so it benefits both parties (diner and management) for them to sell their incredible food in a 55 dollar six course tasting, drawn up and garnished at the whim of the chef, rather than throw it out on tuesday. Quite frankly, the meal blew my effin mind. Some highlights:\n\nAmuse Bouche: Sea Urchin w/ Nasturtium leaf puree. (Eating this brought an ear to ear smile to my face. I don\'t think I stopped smiling for the rest of the night.)\n\n4th: Hanger Steak w/ Sauce Verde, Beef Tongue Ragout (the beef tongue ragout transformed the hanger steak from the cheap cut about which any lousy cheap chef can charge big bucks, preaching the belief that because butchers would take the hanger steak home rather than selling it to customers as though it MUST be the very BEST piece of meat on the cow, which is certainly an exaggeration of the actual truth, into the cut that one brilliant butcher would hide from customers because no one else appreciated the incredible flavor of the meat located so close to the kidney when paired with a light garden-of-herbs sauce growing from an earthy ragout of beef offal. It was depth beyond my warmest memories of demi glaces.)\n\n5th: Concord Grape Sorbet with Candied Fennel (The freshness of the grape in the sorbet reminded me of eating them raw at the end of a night at l\'Esp.. However, it was a little salty. Standing alone, the grape flavor would not benefit from this obtrusive seasoning as an intermezzo.. but then the sweet licorice of the candied fennel, just a tiny piece on top of the sorbet, trickles down your palate on the salty wave of savor. One bite prompted this journey of flavor, a happy New Englander marries an Italian and the whole laughing drinking family is gathered around the table in the yard under the shade of the very tree the grapes came from, and the chef is reminding you very gently, there will be no more meat and fish and vegetables, thank God. Desert is next.)\n\n6th: We each got something different. I got the chocolate. Dark chocolate torte with layers of ganache. Each layer was thin and light, the cake was more crispy than rich, and the flavor of chocolate was nearly overwhelming. Luckily, perched atop the ghoulishly inviting old house of chocolate decadence was a scoop of white chocolate miso ice cream. I was irritated. I was irritated some whacked out modernist cuisine fashionably asian gastronomer would throw miso in my white chocolate ice cream simply to turn some heads in the culinary world, or please a silly chef who needed wild and whacky flavors trying to stay hip in the ever-evolving foody world. Just another crazy way of forcing the time honored elegance of salted white chocolate seem new and we\'re-just-having-some-japanese-iron-chef-fusion-fun... But, the rest of the meal had been so directed, so passionate.. Could there be more to the dish than first angry and mildly drunk impressions? It was only slightly less irritating but ever so delightful to admit to myself, mid bite, I was actually enjoying myself more than I ever had out to eat in a restaurant. It\'s something special to think, especially considering that I pride myself in being a cook and a gourmand interchangeably, had I not gone out to eat the night I had and received the tasting I got I may never have tasted that combination of flavors in my entire life, which in spite of my irritations and reservations, in fact utilizing their slight discord to the benefit of the chocolatey melody, played a classic but complex movement effortlessly. My love of chocolate united after a brief courtship with the flavors on my tongue, presenting themselves with the powerful swing of a 60 piece brass band in the dark corner of a small but crowded restaurant just before closing.']
['Great place, but to get the whole experience get the ten course tasting, but be prepared to spend a lot if money.  Make reservations at the table by the kitchen so you can watch them cook.  Chef very friendly and personally brings you the last course himself. Worth the money.']
['well worth the 45 minute wait on a Friday to sit at the bar; the burger is unbelievable.  Also ordered the crab meat salad which was tasty but  pricey.  We will be back again for that burger.']
["Everything was fine until I saw inside the kitchen. One of the chefs had a horrible and obvious case of PINK EYE! Constantly scratching his face and body as he prepared dishes.\n\nAnother chef had cuts and gouges all over her hands, but no gloves! She said from falling off her bike. \n\nThis is disgusting and unacceptable for any restaurant! Tony Maws should be ashamed. I'm never going back and I'm just trying to help people out: don't go here, unless you want pink eye."]
["Truly enjoyed the dinner we had at Craigie on Main. We had 6 courses even though we only asked for three, our waiter was extremely knowledgeable and affable, and the food was pretty spectacular. The service, the vibe, the decor, (most importantly!!) the wine, and the location were all great. \n\nI greatly enjoyed my halibut, which was perfectly cooked and complimented by some fresh spring ingredients like pea shoots and lemon peel, and I tried the chicken (heavenly) and the lamb three ways. The amuse-bouches were also phenomenal-- from the house-cured pork belly to the trout with caviar and kumquats... mmmmmm. I will be coming back to this place, but I just don't have the funds to frequent it *yet*!!!"]
["I've been to Craigie a couple of times now for special occasions.  It's as good as it gets for fine dining, in my opinion.  It's not stuffy, or boring.  I had an incredible cocktail involving mezcal, grilled octopus appetizer, and some sort of lamb.  Waitstaff has always been attentive without being overly intrusive, and knowledgeable without being patronizing.\n\nIt ain't cheap, but it's worth it.  If you love trying new dishes, Craigie is the place to go."]
["Outstanding!! The food was to die for and the service was excellent.  It's pricey but worth it! Great for a special occasion."]
['My boyfriend and I just came back from dinner here tonight. We went to celebrate his birthday, and when I was making the reservation on Open Table (which was incredibly easy and I highly recommend it -- you don\'t even need to set up an account!), they asked what the occasion (if any) was for the meal. I wrote in that it was a birthday, and then they sent my boyfriend an email telling him that if he printed out the email that he would get a complimentary champagne cocktail and dessert ($21 value!!). \n\nSo we came in and were seated. I was a little annoyed that despite the fact that I had made a reservation, they gave us a table in a part of the restaurant that I would not consider ideal or suitable for a birthday dinner -- we were right by the busy walkway, right behind the handicap ramp! It was too busy so we couldn\'t get another table, but for the money we\'re paying and booking in advance I don\'t really find that acceptable treatment. Besides this, though, service was excellent and attentive, and not only did my lovely get a complimentary cocktail, but he also got to choose any dessert from the menu on the house! Craigie is not one of those restaurants that gives you some random not-even-on-the-menu free dessert - they actually let you have what you want for free when it\'s your birthday. Sweet. \n\nWe shared the fois gras served with a persimmon puree, candied pistachios, and two slices of toasted brioche; lamb three ways (loin, belly, and sausage), and the arctic char fish with fresh shrimp and mussels in a serrano ham broth; my lovely chose the profiteroles with banana ice cream and valrhona chocolate sauce as his free birthday dessert. They also gave us a truck load of house bread, which was amazing -- my boyfriend loved the sweet toasted sesame rolls; the sourdough-type bread was really yummy, too, and the butter was super creamy with just the right saltiness. The fois gras was really good, very creamy, but I\'ve had pate before that was just as good and not that pricey. The lamb was a real highlight, especially the lamb belly -- not as fatty as pork belly, and cooked perfectly. The fish (cooked sous vide, so a little on the raw side) was good, but not anything amazing -- I really liked the mussels that came with it, though. They were incredibly fresh and tasted just like the sea.The profiteroles were really good, maybe a little bit too overpowered by the chocolate sauce, but the banana ice cream was very banana-y, and the profiteroles were nice and light the way they should be. \n\nI went to Craigie when they were still at the original location, and I must say that the quality of the food is the same (which is a positive thing) and the service is still good -- not as formal as it was at the Craigie Street location, but more low-key, which is what I\'d personally prefer. The decor is also more modern here as opposed to being on the fancy side like it was before. Like other reviewers have noted, it\'s nice that they let you know what time they printed the menus to reflect how fresh their food is; I love this place, and I love how generous they are with their "birthday gift" to you. You must come here on your birthday!']
["My favorite restaurant in the Boston area.  The tasting menu is incredible. The layers of flavor throughout keep you happy from dish to dish. I ate here for my fifth wedding anniversary dinner and had the tasting menu. The chef  accommodated  my wife, who was pregnant at the time by choosing alternative dishes for the raw fish. One of the dishes was roasted hamachi kama, which was very memorable. The other item that I remember vividly was the lamb rib with a sweet glaze. It was unlike any rib I've ever eaten."]
['I\'d just like to put in an edit to note that the owners responded to this review to look in to the potential food poisoning, which is pretty damn good business, I think.  To be fair, I didn\'t (couldn\'t) go to the doc, so I can\'t confirm that it was food poisoning, but it was much more than a "something didn\'t agree with me" case (still not totally back to normal), and I didn\'t notice any additional symptoms that would signal an allergic reaction.   \n\nEither way - I\'ll never eat oysters again, and good on their part for doing what they can to ensure that this doesn\'t happen to another customer.  I\'d still like to try the brunch, so I\'ll review again once I go back for that (someone else here reviewed their doughnuts, and I can\'t say that I\'ve ever met a doughnut that didn\'t love me as much as I loved it, so that should be safe!)\n\n\n-----------\n\nMy Craigie experience was, in the end, pretty bad.\n\nI went for dinner at the bar with someone who is a far more adventurous eater than I, and who wanted to share everything (and who was also paying).  So between the two of us, we had the pumpkin soup, the duck-fat roasted brussel sprouts, the oysters, the terrines, and the burger.  \n\nWe started with the oysters and the terrines... I wasn\'t a huge fan of the terrines, and although I had only had oysters once before (admittedly not a huge fan of seafood), the oysters were incredible, and had a bit of a lemony after-taste.  nom.  I was not at all a fan of the brussel sprouts (but I had never had them before, so...).\n\nThe soup was really quite tasty, as was the little grilled cheese sandwhich that came with it.  The burger was insanely messy but also full of buttery, meaty flavor.  The fries were ok.  They should really consider sweet potato fries, that would have been a bonus.  \n\nSomeone else commented that the bread was cold, and indeed it was.  From what you\'re paying at Craigie, I\'d expect piping-hot, from-the-oven fresh bread.  Still, it was quite tasty.  \n\nSo what was the problem?  We left the restaurant at 11 ish... at about 2 am, I was hardcore paying homage to the porcelain gods, which happened several more times until 5 am, and I\'m still feeling pretty queasy.  I have no idea what happened - I only had half a glass of wine, so maybe it was the oysters, maybe the medium-rare burger, maybe a delayed reaction to my newfound disdain for brussel sprouts.  \n\nI\'d love to try their brunch, so maybe I\'ll consider going back to try that after I can hold down food again.']
["I came here with my girlfriend for my birthday. I was very disappointed by the food.\n\nPROs:\n- Bread rolls were delicious (but I don't think they make it)\n- Bourbon pecan ice cream tart was solid \n\nCONs:\n- DON'T come here for a birthday celebration if you're expecting the restaurant to help celebrate. They give you a signed card and a candle in a small plate, which I found disappointing. \n- Burger - Supposed to be one of the best in Boston but it had too many flavors. The wedge fries were too crispy; I tasted more oil than potato.\n- Pork Two Ways: My girlfriend really liked this because of the varying textures, however I thought the flavors didn't mesh well. The plating was beautiful however.\n\nOverall, I couldn't recommend this place to friends and I'm not sure I would go back again."]
["I went to Craigie on Main while visiting my boyfriend in Boston in July.  He picked it because it was the most highly rated restaurant on Yelp in Boston.  We had high expectations, but unfortunately we left without having them filled.\n\nWe got the 3 course meal which was $65. The meal started out with a bread basket, in which we found burnt and cold bread.  It was downhill from there.  For our first course, we got the grilled octopus and the pig's tails.  The octopus was so overcooked that it was bitter.  The pig's tails were very sweet and did not live up to the hype.  For our second course, we had the striped bass and the sword fish.  The striped bass was again overcooked.  The sword fish was extremely salty.  For dessert, we had an asparagus ice cream that had too many components on the plate, including cake and dehydrated strawberries.  The individual components of the dessert were terrible, but when everything was mixed together, it was not as bad.  However, it looked like there should have been a map to go with the plate.  I don't even remember the other dessert that we got.  \n\nThe service at Craigie was also lacking.  Our water glasses remained empty most of the night.  Our waitress never came by to check on how we were doing.  The place is also very overcrowded and loud.  The table next to us was so close that we could hear their entire conversation and since they were engaging in an extramarital affair, I am sure that they would not appreciate that.   The kitchen looked disorganized.  \n\nI gave it 2 stars, only because giving it 1 star seems spiteful, but I honestly do not know what I am giving it 2 stars for.  Maybe that one forgettable dessert deserved another star because I don't remember it being outstandingly bad."]
['Really delicious. \n\nJust consistently great. Went there with someone else the other night and had a flawless meal. Lovely service, nice and warm decor (GREAT date spot), and awesome food. Absolutely nothing disappointed me in the slightest. \n\nThe only issue I had with this restaurant was how difficult it was to choose our food. Everything looked so good! I combed through some other reviews and spotted some objections to the exotic nature of essentially everything on the menu. "Pigs tails, chicken feet, boudin noir, smelts, tongue, sea urchin, fish with collar bones, bone marrow, pork jowl, squid" were all referenced below as "showoffy," and I guess if you\'re not into trying some new things, this isn\'t your place. But I certainly wouldn\'t say that the menu choices were based on pomposity. \n\nI had the smelts, the bone marrow, and the boudin noir, and they were all fantastic. The boudin noir, especially, was absolutely central to the rich, warm, smokey flavors of the dish (a farro risotto that was out of this world). The smelt were delicious (They\'re great fish. Why should the chef avoid them?), lightly battered and fried with a delicious, thick, and tangy squid-ink aioli and crunchy, vanilla-scented heart of palm. Other exoticisms were equally well chosen. The chef isn\'t trying to show off so much as he\'s trying not to let conventions get in the way of what\'s in his head. \n\nI guess part of this issue is what a Boston resident might be expecting from a French restaurant, especially one that, up until a few months ago, called itself a "bistro," a word that conjures for most people images of moules manieres and steak frites. In a food-capital like New York, the menu wouldn\'t stand out particularly much as exotic. That the chef is so willing to experiment -- or, to word it more accurately, so knowledgeable as to feel comfortable making smart culinary decisions like enriching his risotto with boudin noir -- is really what makes this restaurant so great. \n\nThis place is really trying (and succeeding) to be a cut above.\nI really think the food makes this one of the very best restaurants in the city. This place could definitely hold its own in San Francisco or New York, which could NOT be said about most Boston or Cambridge restaurants. And it\'s a really pleasant, un-stuffy place. \n\nDefinitely the only place I\'d think of taking a foodie on a date in the city.']
["First off -- this is a review solely based on their cocktails. I showed up too late to try anything from their kitchen, so that will have to wait.\n\nI finally found a place that takes cocktail-making seriously. A place that stocks several kinds of bitters and knows how to use them; a place that infuses their syrups for an extra layer of flavor; a place that knows how to use ice (so rare to find a place that understands the importance of good ice); a place where bartenders understand their role as performers and magicians behind the bar.\n\nI can't say anything about their food, but you'd be crazy not to try their cocktails. Unbelievable stuff, and friendly service. Tip heavy, because you'll want to come back!"]
['Unbelievable! Service excellent but not at all overbearing. Waiter knowledgable with personality. Very expensive but worth every penny.']
["Excellent!\nThe chef knows his meat, everything is seasonal and tastes great.  You can get pretty funky things in this restaurant like Bone Marrow and Rillette.\nI have to say I've been to many nice restaurants but my beef was never cooked to perfection like it was at Cragie.  The color was unbelievable.  The meat was first class.  I suggest you end your meal with the banana ice cream dessert.  Trust me on that one.\n\nI almost forgot... If you are a burger fan, you have to try one here."]
["Underwhelming. \n\nWith much excitement, we went on Saturday and ordered the 8 course tasting menu. We expected to be thrilled and transported but while there were moments of brilliance, it wasn't anywhere close to the amazing experience we hoped for. \n\nTwo main comments covering food and service. \n\nFirst: Some courses (the fish courses) were exceptional and fully lived up to expectations. But after the fish courses, the dinner lost its pizzaz and courses were ok but nothing fantastic.  I didn't finish several courses; a statement which speaks for itself and something I've never done with another tasting menu. (though one of my friends did finish what I chose not to.)\n\nOne surprise was how poorly salted the food was. Too much salt in some courses (apple/celery sorbet was inedible and almost spit out by our friend) and no great finesse in any. (We had dinner at Per Se and were  blown away by the sheer brilliance of the salting.) \n\nSecond, the experience had none of the polish I expected. Our waiter was terrific and delivered the service one would expect but he was the sole exception.  The rest of the staff and service was rushed and rather perfunctory. Each course was delivered by a different  (rather disinterested) server who so rushed the descriptions that we often didn't catch what they were saying. Also, the tables were so crammed that every time a server walked behind me (constantly), they bumped my chair. We ordered a wine and it arrived after we finished a course (so we were left w/o wine for one course.) No grace or charm to make the experience the special occasion we imagined it would be. \n\nWe've had tasting menus at other restaurants and left feeling like we'd had an exceptional experience. Not here. So: think twice about the tasting menu unless calories and budget are no option."]
['I guess a review is most informative when it goes against the consensus and this is why I decided to share my thoughts on Craigie on Main. I really wanted to like the restaurant especially since the Boston metro area is really behind when it comes to high quality food. \n\nDining is not just about the food (especially when the the bill can easily climb up to 100$/person), it is also about the place. And unfortunately it seems that the Criagie on Main managers need to take some engineering lessons: an open kitchen floor plan definitely adds to a restaurant (look for example at Toro in South End) but to make it work you need a good ventilation system. Otherwise, the restaurant stinks like a diner and every meal tastes like any other. \n\nI hope that there was something wrong with their system that particular night, because it is a huge pity for such a restaurant to fail on something that simple. A piece of advice: it is good to invest on adventurous cooking, but when frying pans are overused in the kitchen, nearby MIT may come in handy.']
['My boyfriend and I spent our anniversary here during our visit to Boston.  The service was impeccable and the food were delicious and beautifully presented.  We were so full by the end of 6-course, but the food kept coming - the desserts were on the house and we even got more chocolate cookies after that.  This is definitely the place you would go for special occasions.']
['Overrated and overpriced. Sure, there was great service - but almost too much to where it was intrusive on our experience.  The food, while very very small portions, was of good quality.  But even with the "discount" 4 course dinner, this was still not worth half what we paid.  Save your money and try other places around the area that aren\'t as heavily priced on fluff.']
["Order the corn potage!  It is the absolute essence of corn, rich and savory and a perfect maize color.  It's amazing either with the pork croutons or without.\n\nI ate the organic chicken breast, which was quite good-- very light and juicy.  I do wish the accompanying veggies were more interesting-- they were good enough, but not great.  \n\nHighlight of the meal was beef marrow with toast-- the waiter described it as 'beef butter' and that's exactly what it was, four giant slabs of toasted sourdough with marrow to spread on them, presented still sitting in the bone.  Downside:  the dish is so rich that there's no way you'll have room for dessert.  I certainly didn't.\n\nI came away pretty impressed with Craigie on Main.  I am going to go back soon-- I'm not sure if I'm going to go cheap and order a burger from the bar (the bar menu looks tantalizing and is quite reasoanble) or go all-out and get the nearly $100 chef's menu.  Either way, I'm looking forward to making the choice."]
['Had brunch here for first time today with wife and 4 month old infant.  Amazingly delicious food -- grits and scallops, wheat pancakes, out-of-this-world "pork-bellies" (their version of bacon) -- and terrific service from Jackie and others.\n\nI was especially impressed with how they dealt with us having a baby  &amp; stroller.  They found us a bigger table, out of the way, to which we could pull up the stroller.  That\'s a lot of grace and flexibility for a very elegant restaurant.  \n\nTo other parents: I think the trick with babies for brunch is to come a little later (around 1:45) when they are still serving but it is starting to empty out.  The same principle works for dinner: its no accident that 5-6:30 is a combination of happy-hour and baby-hour at many of Boston\'s fine establishments. :)\n\nThanks Craigie on Main for a wonderful Sunday Brunch!  We\'ll be back.']
["After wanting to come here for the last 8 years due to all the press on their exceptional hamburger, I finally came here to see what all the buzz was about. The waitstaff were exceptionally accommodating, and seemed like they wanted to make the experience memorable. But, some thing seemed deceptive. Cutting to the story, my fiancee and I ordered two hamburgers, which we were told was not on the menu, but we ordered them anyway. While we waited for our meals we observed filled tables with parties sipping wine, while an open kitchen with animated chefs cooked and prepared orders for their patrons. When our meals arrived, I took a bite out of the hamburger and was at a loss. It occurred to me, that this hamburger was like every other bar burger I have ever eaten from any dive bar to average burger joint. It was not that great, but just average. I'm not sure where all the hype is coming from. When looking at dessert, the waiter mentioned that we should get two deserts because we can share them, and they are just that amazing. I took another chance, but maybe I was suckered into something again. After the fact, the dessert was very good, but still the overall experience was average at best. When the check arrived, I was taken back by how much the total bill came to for two hamburgers and two desserts. In sum, I wasn't really happy with our experience at Craigie On Main. This restaurant is a hyped up restaurant and I won't be coming back."]
['This is one of my favorite restaurants in Boston. Whether for pulling a seat up to the bar and ordering their fantastic burger and some bone marrow or having the chefs keep you company at the "ring side seating" with 8 OUTSTANDING courses. I have never been disappointed.']
["Craigies, I love you.\n\nThis is easily my favorite restaurant in Cambridge. There's nothing to not love about this place. From their atmosphere to their staff, their generosity and their philosophy (using the whole animal, local, organic), not to mention the food.\n\nHere you can get dinner and a show. Request the chef's table while making a reservation or eat at the bar. I've come twice for the six and ten course tasting at the chef's table and once for their burgers at the bar.\n\nThis is not somewhere you can go every night, unless you want to spend $300-400 a night, but it's great for special occasions.\n\nThe first time my boyfriend and I went here, it was my 21st birthday on a Sunday night. There was a signed card from Chef Maws sitting at our table. We ordered the 6 course, but ended up getting 9 or 10, the additional courses were comped. Our waiter was the older waiter and he was fantastic. Always willing to answer questions about the menu, and the wine. Had fantastic suggestions. He was wonderful. Maws wasn't there, which was somewhat disappointing, but the food was top notch regardless. Their wild boar ragout was my favorite course. Home made rye noodles. Perfection. Complementary dessert wine at the end of the meal as well.\n\nThe second time we came was for my boyfriend's birthday on a Saturday. We had the same table and there was again a card for him. We decided to try the 10 course, which again impressed us. Chef Maws was there this time, which made everyone else seem pretty tense. Less laid back than the first time. Our waiter was okay, but not as good as our first waiter. Our first waiter was actually the only person who recognized us and came and made it a point to talk to us. We were served by who I am guessing was the Manager and used the same line as the first time. No big deal, but would have been nice if he remembered us. We were in a food coma by course 7, but muscled through the dessert courses. Their bourbon pecan ice cream tort is ridiculous. It has a savory-sweet crust with bacon in it.\n\nThe most recent time I went was with my brother. After deciding to not wait an hour for a table at Cuchi Cuchi, we walked down and waited for seats at the bar. We tried their elaborate drinks, most of which included bitters. The bartender was training their wine director, and we had a good time watching. The bartender got our names and it made the experience more personal and enjoyable. I didn't know what I was ordering for drinks half the time, but they were all something I had never had before and were all delicious. We got their burgers, which was probably the best burger I have had. We added the house cured bacon, which was another $3, but totally worth it. The green salad alongside the burger and stack of thick fries was well dressed and savory. At the end of our dessert, the bartender made us an additional drink with eggwhites, which I was skeptical about, but it matched the quality of everything else there.\n\nIf you're going to come here, plan to spend a chunk of change, because it's well worth it and you won't be disappointed."]
['Kid. I have been around the world and have tried to eat a burger in every city that I have visited.  I\'ve been on tour doing stand up comedy and subsequently decided to do turn it into "The Burger World Tour".  I\'m trying to find the CREAMIEST BURGER on the F\'ING PLANET THO!\n\nEnough about me. I was just establishing that I know WHAT IS UP with burgers.  So I heard a legend that Craigie had the most bonkers burger in town, and it was something like $18.\n\n"If you\'re going to charge $18 that burger better come with a little sucky suckly love you long time" I thought but I was wrong.  It\'s a burger with potato strings.  \n\nOver all, the place is super dope.  It\'s always crammed to the brim, you can take your chances and try to get a spot at the bar.  If you do though, you probs don\'t want to be there with more than 2 other people cause it will take a while to find some seats next to each other at the bar.\n\nOh and the bar is LEGIT.  The cocktail dudes are super serious about their craft.  They have all sorts of eye droppers with bitters in them that are spritzed with the essence of other shit, it\'s mental kid.  You\'ll get banged up there, BUT you\'ll pay a super high price to do it.\n\nNow on to the burger..  I ordered it like any sane person should. Medium rare.  They brought it to me and it was in fact cooked to perfection.  It\'s crammed deep with bone marrow and other delightful treats that gives it the consistency of smooth butter.  The only problem I had was that the ketchup was made in house, and it didn\'t have the taste of the ketchup I like.  It kind of killed it for me.  The bun was a sesame seed bun, and again.. it wasn\'t to my liking.  The fries or.. potato strings or whatever they called it were BOGUS.  I want something with a thick consistency.  They didn\'t have the feel I was looking for.  All in all, the burger meat was worth it, but the bun and the strings were a total bum out.  Bring your own ketchup packets and order the burger with no ketchup. \nHmm what else..  uh I had a bite of the short rib which was pretty dank but I\'ve had better.  I had a complimentary taste of the marinated mackerel, and it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.\n\nThe ambiance is a 10/10\nThe food is unreal, but I wouldn\'t spring for the burger if I were you. Even though it\'s dope you\'d need to BYO bun or BYO ketchup or BYO fries.  You should stick with the other choices.  If you want a SIQQ burger go to Five Leaves in Brooklyn or Kumas Corner in Chicago.  \n\nOtherwise, save your money.  $18 gets you like 18 whacks at a jack shack in San Francisco.\n\nGo here if you\'re celebrating the loss of your virginity, your birthday, or a new job/success in life.  Don\'t go here if you have less than $80 a person to enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nYou know me though, I ball hard regardless.\n\nSHTUPES!']
["I went to Craigie with my girlfriend for the chef's whim tasting on Sunday night. The first thing that I noticed about the place, other than the head chef berating the waitstaff, was how crowded it was for 9pm on a Sunday night. Definitely make reservations if you are planning on doing the tasting, the place appeared to be full. \nWe opted for the 6 course meal which was exceptional overall. The waitstaff had great knowledge of the menu items as far as how the meal had been prepared. I was a bit surprised that they served us skate at a restaurant this nice as I didn't think that was generally a classy dish. It was prepared nicely though and I'm happy to have finally eaten the fish that is almost always thrown back by fisherman. \nThe restaurant didn't have an especially romantic or classy feel to it, which I guess is a pro or con depending on who you are. I wasn't exactly stuffed after the meal, but definitely enjoyed everything I was served. Next time, I'm going to request to sit in front of the their open kitchen and order their supposedly limited edition burger."]
['The food was good, the service was good, the cocktails and bread are very good.\nWe came in for my boyfriends birthday and I do have to say that I really appreciate the subtle birthday items offered by the restaurant. We both dislike any type of song or dance for birthdays. COM had a postcard signed by the chef waiting at the table wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday and also brought out a small candle when our desserts came. That was just perfect. \n\nWe both did the prix fixe menu. All the food was good, although very rich. I felt a little sick after my entree (I had the veal two ways- short rib and sweetbreads) because everything was just so heavy.  The highlight of the meal was the pigs tails appetizer, which were both unusual and tasty (although very rich). The low point was my boyfriend\'s entree, the Loup de Mer. It was incredibly salty, even for a salt lover such as himself. The desserts were good. \n\nThe service was good, but again, not spectacular. The waitress seemed indifferent to our opinions on the food and was really not engaged with us. Everything was described as "beautiful" and "how could you not like it." Very generic. Nothing memorable. When asked how our desserts were, I described mine as interesting. She didn\'t ask why or if I really liked it. Just smiled and nodded. haha! Perhaps it was late into her shift. \n\n\nYou\'ll notice my general theme here is good. Besides the fish, everything was good. I was looking for remarkable and memorable. Perhaps I was in search of the best meal I\'ve ever had in Boston(not such a high expectation given other Yelpers\' reviews).  Unfortunately, I didn\'t get it. \n\nI would probably give COM another chance for brunch, a chef\'s whim tasting, or drinks after work- something much cheaper than the meal we just had.']
["I don't give out five star reviews very easily but with this restaurant there's little doubt. This restaurant comes as close to perfection as one could hope for. Expertly prepared food and drinks. Fine service. Craigie on Main is amazing."]
["This was our first time dining at Craigie.  We sat in the bar area because we couldn't get a table in the dining room at late notice - it was fine in there though - nice and casual.\n\nWe ordered from both the bar menu and the regular menu - you can order from both in the bar.  My wife got the oyster appetizer and cod.  The oysters were good but a little bit citrus-y for my tastes - my wife liked them though.  The cod was really good.\n\nI had the potage (soup) and the polenta.  The potage was *amazing*.  Shaved with truffles.  Great.  The polenta was really good.  I liked the vegetables on the side.  I could have used a few more vegetables but it was good.\n\nBread was good\n\nService was very good and attentive. \n\nWe will definitely go back on weeknights here.  They have an $18 grass fed super-burger we want to try.  A lot of the food at Craigie is organic and locally sourced which is great.\n\nThe wine list was pricey but the beers were pretty reasonably priced.  Too bad they don't have a reasonably priced house wine.  That would be a nice touch."]
["Underwhelmed. The service and the ambiance are very nice, everyone is solicitous and helpful, as well they should be for the prices you are paying. I had the prix fixe which includes first course, main course, and dessert (no glass of wine), for $67.  The pumpkin soup I had for first course ($18 a la carte) was nearly tasteless.  And the brisket I had for the main was also pretty bland.  All main dishes are $38 a la carte.  Prices (and it should be noted if you are concerned about such things, you shouldn't be here) are located way at the bottom of the menu. I was also disturbed that my main was served lukewarm, atop a small mound of root vegetables and one lonely shiitake. I could have sent it back to be reheated yet realized that would not improve the flavor (are the cooks tasting the food?  I'm not a fan of oversalting, either, and I once criticized Sportello for this. Seasoning, however, I do appreciate).  My friend's main of chicken with whiskey soaked apricots was also bland and she said it was also served lukewarm.  The third person in our group simply had a first course and a dessert since she isn't made of money, and she had no specific complaints, but didn't rave about her choices either.  For dessert I had a tasty affogato with spearmint ice cream (finally, a flavor!), yet it was served in a glass similar to a pint glass with a long, large spoon, so I had to dig for it and eat it awkwardly with a utensil meant for soup.  Low marks for presentation and user-friendliness there; a simple white bowl and smaller spoon would make more sense.  Our total bill with tip came to about $240 and I'm wondering if each person needs to spend at least $100 to be taken seriously here?  Even the music was odd - a song would come on every five or ten minutes, then silence. Then another song. Just strange."]
["Desperately trying to fit Craigie into my (not so) busy schedule before the end of the year, we finally made it over last night. If you haven't been, it truly is a spectacular space, open kitchen right when you walk in, well lit, and overall very appealing. We hustled to get there right when they opened at 5:30 pm to make sure we could grab a table at the bar area (the only place to get the burger) and were fortunate enough to be seated immediately. We've been delegated to eating in bar area's before (see the Met Bar) but have never been treated this well. In my experience the service in the bar is never as good as the main dining area, and in the case of Radius, the service overall was borderline arrogant and snobby despite eating in the main dining room. Craigie does not mess around, as the service, and everyone we interacted with, was impeccable, very attentive, and made it feel like a special night even if we were just eating burgers, again, the polar opposite of my Radius experience.\n   The burger was not like anything I've had all year, I wouldn't call it gourmet, but it's not your run-of-the-mill burger either. This felt special, I still can't say any burger is worth $18, but the effort is there. It's beefy, and unbelievably so, cooked to a perfect medium-rare, the cheddar fully melted and tangy, the house-made bun crispy and chewy all at the same time. The mace ketchup, again house-made, is nice, with a complementary sweetness to it, and there are so many different flavors going on, it's difficult to pick them all out. There is some serious Umami, with the miso flavor the true backbone of this burger, it really takes it to another level. It's easily the best tasting burger I've had in a while. It's not a perfect plate, however, as it comes with shoestring fries, which as I've written before are not my preference. I never know how to eat them, if you use your hands it's nearly impossible to dip in to ketchup, otherwise your using a fork to eat fries and feel like a fool. And there is some seasoning on the fries that I don't love, not quite spicy, but assertive, I much rather just see some regular fries. But unlike most shoestrings, these are fried perfectly and are utterly crispy. The fennel slaw on the side also adds a much needed refreshment component to the meal.\n    Craigie on Main easily delivers the beefiest, juiciest burger of the year, and although it's become a hot destination for burger lovers alike to come to, it's still a process. You need to come early to guarantee a seat, and for two burgers and one beer plus tip, it costs nearly $30 per person. We're talking burgers here, fundamentally, I still take issues with spending that much on a burger, but at least on this night, it was worth every penny."]
['I fear that I can tend towards indecision. So I\'m really all about it when a chef and/or a bartender select my food and drink for me. This made the fact that I could walk in at nine on a Sunday night, sit at a bar, and have an incredibly knowledgeable group of people prepare four tiny cocktails and six courses of food in sequence pretty much fantastic. The fact that, while waiting for our food, we sampled the first three miniature cocktails and couldn\'t decide which was best seemed like a good sign. Even better, the delightful bartender, who knows how to handle a shaker in a way we just don\'t see in Kansas City, responded to our request for "something to work with our food" (our food being a six-course meal of the chef\'s unknown and random choices for the evening) with something incredible, lovely, and that did in fact go with the food. Managing that was a feat in and of itself, as the courses were as varied as possible, from delicate fish to possibly the finest chicken I\'ve ever eaten. I\'ll admit that, when the main course came out, I was a little sad. I wasn\'t sure chicken could hold up the deal after the prior couple of courses. I mean, I\'m the kind of girl that normally doesn\'t order chicken in restaurants because I actually can handle chicken pretty bloody well at home. But this time? This was so beyond my capacity for cooking and creativity, and I have no idea why. But it was mighty fine.\nThe funny thing about that is that we actually were given two different preparations of chicken, and I couldn\'t tell you which was better. The breast option was the most tender thing I\'ve ever eaten, and absolutely mouthwateringly juicy. The other version was a thigh with the most perfectly crispy skin that every calorie counter in my brain switched off and just savored.\nThe desserts were also phenomenal, and clearly working with the spring seasonal fruits available. And the dessert drink, which the bartender had saved for us, was like a creamy dream, but a dream that packed a punch.\nMostly, Craigie on Main fulfills my demands for what makes phenomenal, not just great, food. I don\'t need foods about which I don\'t understand. I don\'t need preparations so complicated I would never be able to handle them. I just need wonderful, fresh ingredients prepared beautifully, keeping their individual flavors but working together on the plate. Basically, I just want simple food prepared beyond the norm. And Craigie on Main takes that one step further, with slightly complicated, extremely well-cooked food. \nAnd I didn\'t have to pick any of it, and that\'s certainly something.']
["Brunch Review\n\nThings I LOVED:\nThe service.  Arrived on time for our reservation, our table hadn't turned over yet.  While we waited, the hostess offered to go get us drinks while we stood there.  Yes please, we like drinks while we wait! \n\nThe donuts.  Get.Them!  Even if you really don't want to start your breakfast off with dessert, just get one for the table and all share a bite.  It shouldn't be missed.\n\nThings I LIKED:\nMy meal.  I eat fish but not meat.  Aside from the pancakes and omelette options which I feel like I could get anywhere, the only other choice was a bagel with smoked trout.  It was good, I have no complaints.  But it's no better than your local jewish deli and at 4x the price, it's not going to blow you away.  If you're a vegetarian, your only entree option is the omelette.  If you're a vegan, BYOB-runch. \n\nThings I DISLIKED:\nThe cocktails.  That hurts to type.  I really love cocktails so it makes me so sad to say that I didn't care for the drinks.  I got the Winter Equivalent.  Imagine a hot cup of whiskey, and that's it.  LIke an Irish Coffee without the coffee.  All the women in my party now have hair on their chests.  The Bloody Mary was tasty but it was so spicy I joked that I was going to run outside and throw myself in a snowbank.  Unnecessary hotness!\n\nEven after all that criticalness, I still really liked this restaurant and I will be back."]
['My wife and I ate here with another couple.  We were able to secure a great table in the bar area.  The service was nothing but stellar.  We did not opt for having the chef cook for our table, but we all took advantage of the prix fixe menu, which allowed us to sample many different tastes.  Everything was spectacular, and it left me wanting to return so that I can sample more of the menu.']
["I'm certainly a fan; however, was a bit underwhelmed by the food and ambience after reading all the RAVE reviews touting the restaurant as one of the finest in the city.  My friends and I ordered the tasting menu and it was good overall but sorely lacked in some areas and there is definitely room for improvement...my gripes about the dinner are more with the servers perhaps than the chef.  The food is fantastic but my main entree was nowhere near hot when it arrived at the table and trust me, tepid mashed potatoes under a tepid chicken, even if it is fantastic chicken, is underwhelming.  The appetizer was the best part of the meal, the foie gras, and the dessert, the cheese plate, was an unsavory regrettable choice.  The ambience is good but the tables are too close for comfort and the guy behind me was actually bumping my elbow with each forkful, which was more than annoying, it was just plain unacceptable.  For a $500 meal with drinks, I definitely expect more.  I will go back to try the brunch and sincerely have high hopes."]
["Love, love, love this place. The food is always amazing, the service phenomenal, and the drinks are sinfully good. The bartenders are knowledgeable, friendly, and very good at what they do. I live in the neighborhood and when I'm in the mood for a quality meal, a bite at the bar, or just a really good cocktail or glass of wine in the company of others, this is the place I head. It's expensive but worth every penny."]
['The food is delicious and tastes simple, each dish prepared perfectly. Not inexpensive but worth the cost. Nice atmosphere.']
['Fantastic food and great service.  The decor is ok, nothing special.  But the food is extremely good.  It is expensive but two people can easily get out of there for under $200.  Worth the trip.']
['New favorite restaurant in cambridge!\n\nService: Fantastic - knowledgeable while still being friendly and approachable. Gave the perfect amount of attention - from the greeting/coat check at the door, drinks in the hall, and dinner.\n\nDecor: Nice - at the table you feel like you have lots of privacy - even though you really dont - not stuffy at all!\n\nFood: Fantastic. We had the 6 course tasting menu. I had the pescatarian and my friend had the regular. Everyone has raved sufficiently - I would say that I was more impressed by the small plates than the large plates (wow to the trio of fish first course, scallop sashimi and homemade pasta) less wow to the fish dish that was more entre-like and a veggie dish with duck egg. \n\nUnfortunately by the 6th course I was too full to finish or really enjoy the rest of my meal - thought I did have a few bites of both dessert! Yum! \n\nMakes me want to go back and just try more apps!\n\nOf course, the cocktails were great as well!']
['For the adventurous foodie, this place is perfect. My husband, who will eat almost anything, fits this profile, so for his birthday, away we went. We both very much liked the vibe--lots of happy people clearly excited to be there, super busy kitchen and bar, friendly and efficient staff, nice enough for a special date but casual enough to remember you\'re still in Central Square. Even my not-easily-fazed husband had to pass on the whole pig\'s head (our server said, "there\'s nothing subtle about it--it comes with the ears), but he loved the crispy pig\'s tail, the grilled octopus, and the perfect execution of the assiette of terrines (assiette de terrines? pardon the poor French). His sirloin wasn\'t quite so memorable, and my non-adventurous choices were good but nothing spectacular--which to me means, if you\'re coming to Craigie and want the real experience, go for broke. If you just want a cool night out at a happening but not overly hipster place (and want to save a little money from the prix fixe menu too), wait for a seat at the bar, order the supposedly Best of Boston burger, and then get dessert at Toscanini\'s next door.']
["Went there with two friends. We sat at the bar after waiting for half an hour. The place is neat and the staff were friendly and hospitable. I ordered their signature cheese burger and it is so far the best in Boston. The burger patty was so thick. Not to forget to mention their crispy and tasty french fries. I enjoyed having my dinner at Craigie's."]
["I went back to Craigie to use a gift card they so kindly sent me and to give them a second chance. I''m glad i did! We sat at the bar on a saturday night with no reservations. My friend and I split the beef (for two) on the entrees section. I took a photo. It was amazing and we were both stuffed afterwards. Also, i am GF so they gave me a delicious plate of marinated olives instead of bread - very nice! I will be back! Thanks Craigie!"]
["The Maître d', hostess and I are locked in an eternal battle of wits whenever I try to make a reservation and am told that I should just forget about eating there cause every seat in the house has been reserved at 15 minute increments from open to close. Ridiculous! Food is decent and on some nights, potentially deserving of 4 stars. Word of advice, service quality heavily correlates with busyness, minus 1 star. If you find yourself at the bar waiting for a seat, don't just stand there, be sure to talk to the bartender and get your name penned, tattooed and burned onto the 'bar list.' After waiting 3 hours one particular night, we wandered over to Salts across the street and had an even better meal with truely exceptional service and Cuchi Cuchi for an even livelier nightcap."]
["It doesn't get better than this!  Just dive in, open your mouth &amp; mind.  Started with a Northern Lights cocktail made with Scotch &amp; Elder Flower. Grilled Spanish octopus,  Vermont Pig three ways, brussel sprouts cooked with duck fat, and ended with sour milk panna cotta.  The servers were all on point, gave great recommendations and the kitchen provided tastings throughout the meal.  If you read other reviews that talk about price; lets say those people probably should stick with TGIF."]
['Craigie on Main seems to be slipping... this was our second dining experience and we left feeling like it did not live up to the hype.  The service was incredibly slow with long waits between courses.  The food was average for a restaurant billed as finer dining.  It was almost as if the creativity of the ingredients had become more important than the overall dish.  Overall, will not be going back for awhile.  Too many other great choices in Boston at that price point.']
["Came here for the 4-course Chef's Whim. It was quite amazing actually, although unfortunately I can't really say what it was that I got.  I think by far my favorite dish was the starter of day scallops, beets, cucumbers, salmon roe, coriander berries, topped with a quail egg.  It was such a wonderful confluence of flavors and textures. Totally made my day.  But as their menu apparently changes from day to day, I'm not sure what I can say about it all.  Each dish was presented well, and the portions were just right, not overwhelming so you don't really get a chance to get sick of anything.  You still leave the restaurant feeling very well satiated after it all though.  The 4-course meal actually also comes with a nice plated dessert.  I really enjoyed the banana chocolate profiteroles. \n\nEDIT: I came here again a few more times, once for their bar food and once for sit down dinner. Bar food, their crispy pig tail is delicious!!! It's actually less like a pig's tail and more meaty, more like what you think of oxtail. It's deliciously fried and crispy with a lovely nuoc cham sauce on it. Exquisite! Also, their bone marrow is very good too, rich and flavorful paired with toasted bread. I would definitely recommend splitting it with several people and not eating anything too heavy afterwards! J had their burger, which I wasn't particularly overwhelmed by, but I think he loved it - which says a lot!  I came here for dinner and got the boar's head for 2 with a friend. It was a little scary to look at and difficult to figure out how to eat it... but omg it was SOOOO good. Perfectly roasted and crispy skin and flavorful and fatty meat. It was waaayy too much food for us, but my goodness it was soooo delicious!"]
["I have put off yelping about Craigie on Main for a while, because I don't think anything I write can do it justice.\n\nHands down the best restaurant in town.\n\nOK, let's start with the drinks.  Amazing.  Every single one I've tried has been incredible.  Northern Lights - who knew scotch made such a good cocktail?  Jalisco Mule - yeah, it's called that because of the amazing ginger kick on the finish.  Tavern Sparkler - everything you think it is.  And so on.  No triple sec here - everything is handmade, including their grenadine, which is made onsite from pomegranates.\n\nI have sampled many delicious things in my visits to Craigie:  octopus. cod cheeks. Long Island cheese pumpkin. brussel sprouts FRIED IN DUCK FAT.  lamb many ways. fiddlehead ferns.  pigs' tails.  olive oil chocolate mousse.  ALL AMAZING.  \n\nThe service is impeccable every single time.  On my most recent visit, our table was not ready for our party of five at the appointed time.  No problem by me - more time to sample the drinks.  The managers, however, felt it was a big problem - and comped us some drinks and a bottle of wine, while apologizing profusely.  Servers are always attentive and knowledgeable but not pushy.\n\nBottom line:  foodie heaven, and worth every penny."]
['Wonderful, amazing, sophisticated, unique, and really really good!\n\nWant an amazing gastronomic experience??  This is the place.\n\nI HAD PIGS TAILS and LIKED THEM!!!  I now dream about them.']
['The food is very good and they are a bit pricey. We had the 10 course tasting menu. The dishes were a bit small but it does give you a sampling of their menu . It does get crowded and the next time I think we will do the bar.  I definitely recommend reservations in advance. They have a different menu at the bar then they do on the dining room. The specials are what I recommend if you are in the dining room and try the burgers at the bar...']
["their food is really good, but i'm not all like OMG. it's more like, wow, this is really solidly delicious.  i do like the cheaper bar burger that everyone is into.  i also like coming for brunch and getting the donuts."]
["While not deserving of five stars, CoM was excellent and we'd gladly return to try a dinner. This review is for a Sunday brunch.\n\nAll the food achieves the difficult balance of taste and innovation.  Service was friendly and very efficient.\n\nWe order two of the hashes, one made with in-house smoked haddock and brussel sprouts and the other with potato and corned beef cheeks. Probably preferred the haddock one because it was a bit lighter and smokier but both were very good.  Nitpicking, the corned beef hash sauce was a bit heavy and we didn't finish the potatoes.\n\nOrange juice was fresh squeezed and fab.  A fresh fruit crumble with apple, plum and annise/mint ice cream was excellent."]
["I'm really glad that we returned to give Craigie on Main another shot. This time we had the vegetarian tasting menu, which was spectacular. I am not sure that I've had a better vegetarian restaurant meal in my life. The service was also fantastic. We are very impressed with what Tony Maws and his team pulled off.\n\nIt would be great if there were more options on the menu like the things that we were served on the vegetarian tasting. Sometimes you just want an app and an entree, and the CoM vegetarian options on that front aren't as good as what's included in the tasting. \n\nIn any case we did love it, and we will certainly return as soon as we can afford to do so again!"]
['Phenomenal!! Relaxing, unpretentious, and approachable take on fine cuisine. It\'s all about the food here. Each of our 10 courses was perfection. Most had a decidedly asian flare: starting with trio of squid noodle, rillete of smoked bluefish, crab fritter, and moving on to three successive courses of fish: hiramasa sashimi salad, rare Tasmanian trout in consumme, then hamachi collar.Even the home made taglatelli pasta course with pig heart sausage was adorned with a little uni. The two main courses included a delightfully unctious pork belly followed by goat loin so tender, it was criminal. Not quit satiated, we added two orders of bone marrow and brussel sprouts sauteed in lard. Cloud nine! (must have been a very heavy cloud after 7 courses!). We rounded out our meal with concord grape and yogurt sorbet, then sour milk panna cotta (out of this world) and pain par du with icrecream. The tenth and final course was a cider and yogurt foam-appropriately airy. \n\nTheir website bills their tasting menu as the "ultimate Craigie experience". I wouldn\'t be so modest. The "ultimate experience", period, is no exaggeration.']
["Way too expensive for mediocre food!! My husband and I went here for my birthday last night, and I had been looking forward to it for weeks. Unfortunately we were both very unimpressed. I had the chicken stuffed chicken, and it was good, but nothing to write home about. My husband had the pork 3 ways, and for one it was the most comically small plate of food I have ever seen, and two it wasn't even good! The tiny rib that came on the plate had only a few morsels of meat on it and the rest was mostly gristle.\n\nWe had the fried clams to start and they were delicious, and also the service was good, but this was far from a great dining experience for us. Also, I didn't love the open kitchen...people yelling out orders the whole time, how is that ambiance?"]
["Great food, very good (almost too attentive) service. The vibe is cool and busy.The octopus salad, in particular, was the most tender I've ever tasted. We had smelts, bass and veal and it was all good.  Frankly, everything was perfect except the coffee at the end of the meal. Perhaps decaf is declasse but it was burnt. Would have been better not to have had it available."]
['Ate before Christmas here, pretty good bread and food is good too.  We ordered several appetizers (ham, salad), main roasted chicken and pork - they were all good.  Dessert was somewhat disappointing...  Miso grazed ice cream... tasted very miso, just weird.']
["The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.....\n\nLet's start with the Good:\n\nThe food was very tasteful.   We started with the Hiramasa Sashimi salad .  Fresh and light slices of fish with a unique salsa mixture on top with a yummy vinaigrette.    My entree was the duo of veal.  Cooked perfectly and the pieces just melted in your mouth.  My bf opted for the hanger steak.  Again perfectly cooked,  though a rather small portion for the price.  We ended the meal with the special dessert of the day.   Homemade ice cream with a wafer like cookie, that was just ok.\n\nNow for the Bad:\n\nWhen we walked in there was a party of 4 in front of us waiting to be seated.   The restaurant is not very big and there was really no place to stand without getting in the way.   The hostess was very melancholy and though greeted us well enough, didn't even smile.   After settling in at our table we were pleasantly greeted by our server.  The pleasantness soon ended as my sleeve (and my bf's) kept catching on the edge of the table.  There are white tablecloths on the table but then it is overlaid with a white piece of paper.  The paper is just a smidge bigger in area of the table.  So unless you rested your arms on the table, each time you reached for your glass etc it would snag.  It got to be very annoying and I almost wanted to ask the server to remove it.  \n\nAnd here's the Ugly:\n\nFirst, even with the 'bad',  the deliciousness of the food may have convinced me to come back.   Unfortunately the next thing I write will most definitely keep that from happening.\n\nThis restaurant has a cozy, casual yet refined atmosphere about it.  The kitchen is completely open so you can pretty much see all the food being prepared as well as hear what's going on.   Sometimes it got a little loud but wasn't too, too bad.   Ready for the ugly?   From where I sat I had a pretty good view of the kitchen.  Right in my line of site was this chef with a trimmed beard.   He wasn't preparing any food at that moment but I watched as he scratched his face, chin, front and back of his neck.  Without washing or wiping his hands I continued to watch as he began preparing an entree.   I kept a very watchful eye to see if his hands would touch any food...it did.  I watched a few minutes more and saw again and again as he touched food.   He wasn't tossing a piece of food back and forth in his hand but he touched it significant enough that I finally turned my head away not wanting to know if that was my entree he was preparing.  Not too long after this happened our food did arrive and I was very tempted to send it back.  My bf reminded me that if we were not privy to their kitchen we wouldn't have a clue who's hand may have touched are food and just decided to let it go.   \n\n\nSadly,  although I enjoyed the food, it isn't just the food that makes a patron want to return."]
['This review is overdue. We went a few months ago. Service was painstaking, marrow generous and delicious. My meal was great. My husband had salmon, I really didn\'t like his fish, but he loved it so go figure he is eastern european, so if you like "herring in a fur coat" you will like the salmon. He was bummed not to get the burger, but I do understand the chef feels he can\'t keep up quality if he increases quantity, so go early if you want it. Otherwise, my opinion can be summed up thusly: in the great Craigie v. Hungry Mother debate, we are a Hungry Mother couple.']
["Cragie is easily one the best restaurants in the city. Tony's style of cooking and taking rustic ingredients, great prep, and a semi-casual environment works over and over. This place was great in Harvard Square, and it is even better now. \n\nI went there two weeks ago, and they had a $75pp special with amuse, app, entree, dessert, and your selection of dessert wine. The new space is great, but can get a little loud. Otherwise the ambiance is great, busy, friendly, and warm. The kitchen is open and is the first thing you see when you enter the space. Here is the rundown: \n\nAmuse - Banyuls cured duck and lardo - Very nice, the duck was tasty, seasoned well and just enough. The lardo was luxurious and a nice way to start \n\nAppetizer - 3 Terrines - 4 livers, goat shoulder, and head cheese. These were all fantastic, the accoutrements were fantastic as well - cornichons, pickeled shallots, along with two other sauces that I can't remember. The head cheese was the star in this one though. My Fiancee had their octopus that was fantastic and like octopus I had in Italy. A friend at the same dinner had sashimi he couldn't stop raving about. \n\nMain - Pork two ways: Grill Belly and Confit of suckling pig. This was a religious experience. The belly was just barley grilled and so decadent I almost passed out. The suckling pig was delicate, but had a crispy layer of skin that was awesome. This was served with cashews and a simple sauce (among other things) that kept it interesting, yet simple. \n\nDessert - Profiteroles: This one is hard to screw up, but it was also great. Valrhona chocolate and rum sauce and homemade banana ice cream. I also had a Saussignac dessert wine (like Sauternes) that was fantastic. \n\nI've been there before and I'm definitely going back. The food was great, the drinks from their bar were awesome (Northern lights!) and there were few things to complain about. We liked it so much, we're having our rehearsal dinner for our wedding there!"]
["Beautiful restaurant, love the open kitchen and brick walls. It was very romantic and quaint. The Chef's Whim was definitely a winning choice. Service was very professional and subtle. Love the bartenders who were playful, helpful and had great sense of humor."]
['For my 30th birthday, Abby took me out to a restaurant we\'ve been dying to try: Craigie On Main. (As a side note, after we found parking a few blocks away from the restaurant, we walked in and gave our name for our reservation. The lady at the front looked in her book and told us that there was no reservation with our name on it. I tell her that I got a call that day from the restaurant confirming the reservation. She tells me she is sorry, but she can seat us when something comes available. Then I look onto my phone and show here the number that called me...yup, not their number. Apparently we walked into another restaurant instead of Craigie on Main. Awesome...we looked like idiots.)\n\nAnyway, once we walked the extra block to the restuarant that actually says "Cragie on Main" on it\'s windows, we were seated right away. I knew immediately that I would love this restaurant. The open kitchen is almost larger than the entire dining area. There were bar seats right at the kitchen, but we were seated around the corner at a nice two seat.\n\nOur waiter came over and asked us if we had any questions. We said no, that we were both going with the Chef\'s 10 course tasting. Then the waiter asked us if we had any likes and dislikes. He told us that Craigie on Main is a "head to tail" restaurant and pondered if we were ok with eating items like sweetbreads. Of course we are fine with it. We told him we love pig cheek and he said he\'ll definitely try to see if we can get some pig head\'s in our meal. (Each chef\'s tasting is catered to each table apparently. Though throughout our meal, I did notice other tables getting some similar dishes, but that\'s ok.)\n\nI will now recount what we ate, thanks to the printed menu we received at the end of the meal. I told our waiter we were food bloggers (he noticed us taking pics of everything) and he said he\'d get us a menu. That was nice of him.\n\n#1. Three Chilled Seafood Preparations\n"fresh uni, lime pickle vinaigrette", "foid de lotte au torchon, sea trout roe", "lobster salad, hackleback caviar"\n\nRight off the bat I\'m freaking excited. Monkfish liver, something I\'ve been dying to try for the last couple of years. I\'m so glad we get to try something new. First the uni. It tasted like most uni I\'ve ever had, which is to say smooth and creamy and very good. The lobster, which Abby absolutely loved, had a tiny dab of caviar on it that made the dish for me. And the monkfish liver...it was everything I had hoped it to be. Foie gras from the ocean is the best way to describe it. So good...so rich and decadent.\n\n#2. Salad of Big Eye Tuna Sashimi\nLaying on top of a red onion-shiso salsa that was so good, Abby used bread to soak it all up.\n\n#3. Grilled Hawaiian Walu\nOne of my most favorite plates of the night. Walu, a fish I\'ve never heard of before, was meaty and very flavorful.\n\n#4. Red Chile and Sesame Marinated Salmon Kama\nThe collar of a salmon. Again, something I\'ve never had before. Other than the small bones that hid inside the piece we were given, this was a fantastic dish. The crispy skin and the delicate flesh were perfect together. The bones though, could not be ignored. One of the only knocks during our dinner.\n\n#5. Pork Belly and Cepe Tortellini\nMy least favorite plate, mainly because I didn\'t like the pumpkin puree too much. The pork belly was very good and I was wishing we had a little bit more of it...\n\n#6. Grilled Pork Belly\nAsk and you shall receive. The pork belly was perfectly cooked and I enjoyed the pomegranate seeds that accompanied the meat. I did not, however, care for the glazed chestnuts. No matter, the pork belly was scrumptious.\n\n#7. Vermont Organic Lamb 3 ways: Roasted Loin, Braised Belly, Crispy Confit\nAbby hates lamb. If there\'s one protein that Abby refuses to eat, it\'s lamb. She liked the lamb at Craigie on Main. Nuff said. (An incredible dish, though the sausage was just ok, the braised belly and roasted loin were unbelievable.)\n\n#8. Jasmine/Rooibos Tea Infused Panna Cotta\nLet\'s just say we didn\'t like either and leave it at that.\n\n#9. Olive oil and Taza Chocolate Mousse or Long Island Cheese Pumpkin Parfait\nMy chocolate Mousse came with a little candle for my b-day. That was nice. The mousse itself was very rich, but was a good size portion that I wasn\'t hit with too much sweetness. Abby loved her pumpkin parfait. Abby also ordered a cup of tea, that came with it\'s own pot.\n\n#10. Chilled Phttp://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/central/each Mousse\nA very nice way to end the dinner. Very light and refreshing.\n\nOverall, a fantastic meal. Other than the bones in the salmon, nothing to really complain about. The service was at times slow, especially when we were waiting to pay the bill and leave, but since we weren\'t really in a hurry it didn\'t matter. Water was refilled in a timely manner, and the waiters were very knowledgable and friendly. I give Craigie on Main a 4 1/2 out of 5.']
['Perfectly prepared, perfect portioned, delicious food. Comfortable clean setting. Yum cocktails. Yum for brunch. Dinner is a bit pricey, however its so good 4.5 stars rounded up!.']
['Being a graduate student, normally Craigie would be a bit out of my price range. But for a birthday brunch, wow, I was blown away. The beef cheek and tongue hash was simply crazy good. If only they had bigger servings!']
['I have been to Craigie on Main several times and been pleased with the service and the food. However, I believe they are overpriced for what they deliver.']
['Great food, really stellar service, fantastic wine list. If I lived here I would come every night.']
["This place was amazing. I met my friend here for a ladies' brunch and we were blown away. The food was incredible, the reuben was one of the best I had ever had and the donut with dulce du leche was superb. Loved my champagne cocktail as well! Also, thank god for a brunch spot with fantastic tea. That made a world of difference to me! The service was excellent too, we were seated at the bar and the bartender was great at giving recommendations. My friend is a big meat snob (also Brazilian) and said the steak she ordered was one of the best she had ever had in this city. Can't say enough nice things about this place, going back for my birthday brunch hopefully!"]
['Excellent, creative, fun and unexpected, high quality. Not sure what else to say. Oh, expensive!']
['My 5 friends and i went to Craigie on Main - the food was a complete disappointment. The hosts at the entrance were welcoming, the restaurant offers valet parking. Everything else was mediocre at best. Our server was slow, it was a Saturday night. We tried the 6 course tasting menu. I felt the chef was trying to mix too many flavors. \n\nAfter my post, the owner e-mailed me wanting to fix things, which is a great sign for a restaurant wanting to improve. I will be going there again anonymously to see if we just had a bad day. I am a huge chocolate fan so my disappointment with the dessert might be due to my finicky palette. I do not accept gift cards or free meals from restuarants to "make up" for a bad review. I like the owner\'s pro-active approach and feel I need to give the restaurant another try.']
["I am afraid that making plans is not my forte.  I have been trying to go to Cragie on Main since it was Cragie St. Bistro.  Unfortunately it is not the type of place that (apparently) you can just go to dine without reservations.  I bit the bullet and made reservations a week prior for my wife and I and another couple equally appreciative of world-class cuisine.  Cragie on Main requires a credit card to hold reservations, $25 per person if you cancel prior to 24 hours in advance if they are unable to fill your table - based on the number of people the on a Saturday, losing any money due to a late cancel doesn't really seem feasible.  \n\nWe arrived just prior to our 9:00 PM reservations; our table was not yet available, so we headed to the bar for a few cocktails.  Good list, I would recommend the 1:2:3... The bar was packed and apparently has its own menu, made a mental note to come back and check it out separately.  \n\nWe were sat at approximately 9:15.  Our waiter arrived shortly there after to go over the menu.  When you have prepared yourself to spend over $100 per person on a single meal you expect a certain level of competency from your gastronomic guide, our waiter (his name escapes me) exceeded our expectation.  Not at all rushed, genuinely interested in our questions, confident in his recommendation without a hint of condescension.  We inquired about the 6 course tasting menu ($90) but unfortunately all members of the table must participate, and my friend and I were unable to convince our dates, a shame, I'm sure it would have been fantastic.  We settled on a four-course menu for $75 and frankly could not have ended up more pleased.  My meal consisted of Pork belly, Sashimi, Venison &amp; a cheese plate to top off the meal.  Each course was unique but each shared a common quality to expertly prepared dishes, uniquely paired components that stand out independently but come together to exceed the sum of their parts.  No dish exemplified this more that the sashimi - Assiette of Kona Kampachi Sashimi.  \n\nAll in all I was very impressed, and my meal was among the best I have ever had.  It was about $215 for the both of us, and frankly paying that seemed quite reasonable.  I have spent similarly (L'Espalier- a bit more, Troquet - a bit less) on similar types of meals and left disappointed.  In Boston, I believe this is about as good as it gets."]
['We were walk-ins, and i was ready to bolt out the door (I hate that unwelcome, second-class lurker feeling when trying to scam a table at a "fully committed" restaurant). \n\nI credit the lovely waitress who saw us standing awkwardly waiting for a few seats at the bar to open up with making me stay. She greeted us warmly, gave us two glasses of water, and generally made us feel welcome and comfortable. We soon settled into our seats at the bar, ready to make it an evening. I LOVED being seated at the bar. It was better than a regular table for a jumpy, need-my-water-filled immediately type like me who hates searching for a server throughout the meal. My server was right there, behind the bar, the whole time, whirling up cool cocktails with tinctures and retro bottles of spirits. He was there when we needed him, and was so friendly and pleasant. As were the servers who brought out our 6 course vegetarian tasting menu. We aren\'t vegetarians, but I\'ve always wanted to try super-elevated veggie tasting menu by a top chef, and wow, we did it! Amazing. \n\nBut if anyone on staff is reading this: you could have served crackers and  cheese and I would have been happy b/c we were treated warmly, kindly, and sincerely by each and every person we encountered on staff. The food was flawless, but to be treated with unfailing warmth and kindness was the true magic.']
["I'm ruined! I no longer care to go out to eat anywhere else. Sorry, friends and family, I know you're sick of hearing about it.  I'll take you there whenever you want."]
["I've been in here twice. The first time was impressive until I got my entree, which I wasn't that pleased with. I had a very tiny portion of salmon for $33 and was disappointed in the fact that I left hungry after spending over $120 on dinner. So I emailed the owner afterwards instead of blowing steam on yelp. She was completely professional and sent me a gift certificate to go back. Time to put it to use and do a review. \n\nI recently returned again with my Yelp Kendall Passport and took advantage of the free drink and appetizer along with dinner. It was perfect timing to celebrate an anniversary too. \n\nFor the appetizer we got the seafood sausage. It was delicate and tasty. Everything was ground up like sausage. The bartender highly recommended it. \n\nI chose in advance to get the $39 pre-fixed menu. The selection that night was a pate, which I have had there before and was delicious. Along with that I got the roasted chicken. The chicken was amazing. The best I ever had. Super juicy with so much flavor. My boyfriend got the pork three ways entree which he gobbled down.  For $36 he was a bit disappointed with the small amount on the plate, after it it was just pork so why so skimpy? It was a good thing I had enough chicken cause he shared the rest to feel full. One thing I wish this place would do is add a bit more to your entree or beef up the size of what you get, both times I found one of the entrees to be very skimpy for the hefty price. The tasting menus look substantial but are in the $75-$95 range per person. I really thought the food was great, however there really should be a veggie or starch on the plate to balance it out when you are already paying $36 for your entree. \n\nFor dessert we had a berry cobbler. Again it was delicious and just a great way to end the meal. \n\nDrinks were poured creatively. Everything is carefully measured out and quickly replenished. Service at the bar was friendly, almost interactive as you watched them make some cool drinks, dropping potions here and there. It reminded me of Drink a little bit. \n\nThe food is very tasty and the place has the right customer service attitude. Clearly there are some very well trained chefs in there. For the steep prices though and tiny portions, I probably won't rush back."]
["So well liked yet did not meet the hype. Dined 12/13/11 to celebrate a special occasion. Cocktails and wine delightful, the amuse bouche was creative and perfect, terrine was well executed, good accoutrements, and the sour cream cheesecake, which we never ordinarily order, was a real winner. But oh sad, what an inconsistent meal. The Brussel sprouts were mush and so carmelized that they were too sweet. The pork entree, while cooked beautifully, was so strange. I couldn't tell you the exact ingredients but it was like sweet grass or Chervil, soy, tangerine, pear - the savory was lost, sweet and thin. The rib eye was herbed - one of us like it, um, I did not though again, it was a nice piece of meat. I'll even say the bread basket was brilliant, since this is so often overlooked. The waitstaff was attentive and pleasant and the energy in the restaurant lively but my, my...what an on/off experience."]
["A friend and I had the eight course tasting menu last night. The strongest impression that I had was how bland the food was, the only really outstanding course was the delicious venison. Otherwise 3 of the 8 courses were devoted to sweet flavors (even fish was given an icky sweet citrus coulis), and one item was actively repulsive (a bimbao inspired thing with raw egg all over the top). I live in Portland (Oregon), where maybe the food scene is more robust, I don't know, but I was really perplexed that such unimaginative, almost flavorless food would receive the accolades as Craigie apparently has (New England is known for bland food for a reason I suppose). The lack of textural interest and appealing mouth feel to most of the items was also noteworthy, and the final course, a very generic panna cotta with a berry compote, was a fittingly dull conclusion to such a meal.\nOn a bright note, the wait staff was pleasant and professional and is the reason the review is not a one star."]
["Craigie on Main is the garden of earthly delights. The ten-course tasting menu was extraordinary -- every dish was interesting and thoughtfully created. Service was deft but warm. It was a bargain for the quality, flavor and beauty. I'll dream of the ricotta gnocchi with beach pea blossoms forever."]
["The food was good, though small portions (do not come hungry!).  However, what disappointed me was their service.  Maybe they should have less staff, as messages get lost from the Host to Waiter.  A few weeks ago, I brought my partner for a birthday dinner, and my only request was to do something to celebrate the birthday.  The host assured me that a note would be made, and that they would bring out a candle on a dessert, do something nice.  When the desserts came out - nothing.  Little details like this make or break a place.  Honestly, if you don't these things, then fine; but, don't claim to have the works and then not deliver.  Wish I would've taken him elsewhere, because the dinner ended up being like any other regular/ordinary outing."]
["We decided to give it another shot tonight and had a better experience. We ordered from the prix fixe menu. I got the octopus, sirloin, and chocolate coffee &amp; ice cream. My girlfriend ordered pork belly ragout, cod, and chocolate mouse torte. We started with drinks. My old fashioned was good, but had a little too much ice for my liking. Bread was brought out followed by an amuse bouche for each of us. Sadly, the bread wasn't warm when it arrived. It was tasty, but cold. I had a fried pig ear amuse bouche and my gf got scallops. Both were delicious. Our appetizers were both pleasing too. My steak was a little tough, but cooked suitably. My gf really enjoyed the cod. When I tasted it, I agreed that it was one of the better dishes of the night. We also opted to get the bone marrow side dish. Neither of us had had this before, and I had heard good reviews about it. We both thought it was a little too salty. However, that may just be how bone marrow is. We were brought a sorbet to cleanse our palates before dessert. It had a very strong lemon flavor. Almost too strong. My Taza chocolate coffee with ice cream came with a very nice presentation. It wasn't very unique or creative, but it was just what I needed after a large meal. My gf's torte was ok, but nothing special. \n\nOverall we thought the service was friendly and attentive. It was a little on the slow side, but I could see how some guests may enjoy the servers not being too intrusive. I think this is something that every guest has a different opinion on, so the restaurant may have a difficult time pleasing everyone."]
["One of my Boston favorites. Excellent specials (including scallops when i was there) plus delicious (but sometimes overly rich) desserts. Parking is tough and while valet is nice, it isn't cheap - use the garage option for sure. The bar is a nice option for a more casual meal."]
['We had the six course Chef\'s Whim. All the dishes were delicious except for the "trifecta" pork dish that consisted of spice-rubbed pork rib, fatty pork belly, and dry, fibrous pork confit. Pork overload!  Some particular dishes that stood out above the rest were the hiromasa sashimi, and buttered corn soup and grilled cheese. I also liked tasting the variety of three different types of yummy desserts. The service was friendly and attentive. The wine pairings were also spot on.']
["Where do i start..... the friendly staff, the amazing service, the unforgettable meal or the creative drinks? \n\nI recommend getting there a little before your reservations so you can take some time to enjoy a drink at the bar. Creative and fun cocktails will surely delight everyone in your group and the bar tenders have no problem mixing you up a little something off the top of their head that will blow your sox off. (If you can't tell I take drinking seriously) They keep home made infusions and bitters for all mixed drinks. \n\nI have been to Craigie on Main a hand full of times now and I have never once had a bad meal or bad service. The wait staff is prepared to answer any questions about preparation and they are willing to give a guided hand to those who have a hard time making up their minds. The staff is well versed in wine so they are able to help make amazing suggestions on what will go best with your meal. The chef Tony Maws cooks each dish with love and care (you can taste it) \n\nI started with the House-made Terrines and the Crispy Pig Tails. AMAZING! They used to have Bone Marrow that was my all time favorite but I have not seen it on the menu for some time now. The Terrines are light and delicious and a great way to get your pallet ready. The Crispy Pig Tails are to die for. \n\nFor my entre I have tried a few dishes the first was the Local Grass Fed Beef Burger ( I had dinner at the bar) This burger is like none I have ever had before and no other burger has ever compared! The beef is surrounded by a home made bun and when you take your first bite.... Perfection....the beef just melts in your mouth. The shoe lace fries are seasoned like a dream. I have also had the Pork Three Ways, again the meat is just so fresh it cuts like butter and the flavors just explode in your mouth!\n\nFor desert I got the Sour Milk Panna Cotta. It was not the nicest looking desert however it was so good our table ordered a second round. Craigie on Main is in my top 5 restaurants to go to and I recommend them to everyone I know."]
["After reading my review of a less than stellar first visit, Chef Maws personally invited us back to redo the tasting menu. I will commend the service at Craigie upfront. For instance, my date and I were given individual wine and beer pairings, respectively, after I briefly mentioned that I was more of a beer person. You are definitely pampered by the service staff-not to the overwhelming level of classic French restaurants, but still top-notch.\nWe were started off with a nice citrus-flavored aperitif with the faintest hint of licorice. Then came a basket of *warm* bread followed by a fish trio amuse. The sashimi with horseradish and roe was fantastic. The horseradish added zest without overpowering the sweetness of the fish, and the briny pop of the roe added a nice textual contrast. The two smoked fish rillettes were forgettable. My date noted that they were seasoned with similar spices, muddling their individual flavors and the flavors of the fish-also, one of them had a texture reminiscent of canned tuna, which wasn't too pleasing. \nA Riesling accompanied our next course, kampachi sashimi with citrus, mustard seed, and pine nuts. The mustard seed and citrus paired well with the sashimi and the pine nuts added a more unctuous earthy note that brought everything together-excellent. We were then given champagne with a lightly poached salmon with clam and Iberico ham. This was the highlight of the meal-the fish was velvety in texture and accompanied by salty, paper-thin bits of ham, and a buttery shellfish bisque tied everything together nicely.\nNext was farro pasta with mushroom and tripe ragu and shaved truffles. I enjoyed the flavor and texture of the pasta, but the truffles added little earthiness to the sauce. I'm a fan of offal, particularly the texture of slow-braised tripe. Unfortunately the tripe was cut into such small pieces that all of its spongy gelatinous texture was lost-this seemed like an offal dish for the offal-averse. The accompanying champagne, which went great with the previous course, was ill-matched.\nOur next course was cotechino with lentils topped by a runny egg and foie gras foam. This was paired with a Belgian IPA and white wine for my date. I get fried eggs on my burger so this dish really spoke to me-unfortunately it looked better than it tasted. The runny yoke combined with the lentils to make a great sauce with a nice texture, but the flavor of the cotechino was mostly lost unless eaten by itself. Like the truffle shavings in the previous dish, the foie gras foam added little flavor to the dish and seemed contrived. The beer paired well and the hoppiness helped cut the richness of the egg and lentils.\nRebounding from the cotechino was two giant halves of roasted marrow bones topped with pastrami. The unctuous marrow on perfectly crusty pieces of bread was given a nice textual and flavor kick by flakes of sea salt and cut by the bitterness of the beer. While I love both marrow and pastrami, the combination was approaching fatty overkill and I would've appreciated a little acid-perhaps the standard parsley salad? Our final savory course was a trio of duck: roasted breast, seared foie with grapes, and homemade sausage. These preparations were accompanied by a farmyardy red that was bold and flavorful by itself and paired well with the duck. The slices of breast were decent, but the fat could have been rendered a little more and one of the slices was a little sinewy. My date extoled the seared foie, which was beautifully caramelized and matched well with tender juicy grapes, as the high point of the meal. Unfortunately, the duck sausage did not have any semblance of duck flavor but instead had an unpleasantly mealy texture that made us give up on it. \nThe first dessert was a panna cotta with pomegranate jam and ginger gremolata. The panna cotta had a wonderful texture and the hint of ginger was really exciting. Then came a bittersweet chocolate mousse tart and white chocolate ice cream and caramel and jam-filled beignets with a creme anglaise dipping sauce. The chocolate tart was paired with a great imperial stout and the beignets were paired with a much-too-sweet dessert wine. The tart and ice cream were good, nothing special. Much to my dismay, the beignets were dense and cakey and not at all reminiscent of the light, pillowy beignets I've had previously. \nOur second Craigie experience was better than our first. Unfortunately, the highs of the night were weighed down by a few lows. I can't say if we were left unimpressed because we were expecting the kitchen to wow us with every course or because we just had a spectacular meal at The Breslin last week. While we appreciate the generosity of the restaurant (the comped meal came to $400 before tip), we were still left underwhelmed. There were definitely standout dishes on both visits, but there were simply too make 'just ok' dishes and dishes that missed the mark that could not be overlooked, especially to justify the price."]
['The food, drinks, and service here are incredible.  I highly recommend the tasting menu and brussel sprouts.  I also like how  the atmosphere is fairly casual and laid back.  \nYOU MUST GO HERE IF YOU APPRECIATE GOOD FOOD!']
["Tried the eight course tasting menu for a double birthday celebration. The smoked buefish course was outstanding.although the roe caviar topping didnt quite have the saltiness or crunch a better caviar would have added (nor the price of such- a trade off )  Two other fish courses including an amberjack sashimi and a nice seabass in vinaigrette type sauce were perfectly done. Loved a tagliatelle type pasta with red sauce. The main was a great veal chop with sweatbreads - cooked  perfectly. The wine selection s ok - we had a white burgundy to start (2005 chassagne Montrachet) then a great 2005 brunello di montalcino- this needed decanting to air - they have inadequate decanters that don't do this properly and need to step up their wine expertise. With desert we had a fun flight of del maguey single village mezcals- the chichicapa was the star if you like a smoky style. Service was friendly and attentive and the chef came out to say hello with the veal chop course! Which was nice. a great meal - perhaps 4.5 stars for food, 4 for wine expertise and service? Ambience is more bistro than fine dining- also a 4."]
['Underwhelming and seriously overpriced.  You can get better meals and service for less money in this area (ahem, Ten Tables and Hungry Mother).  \n\nThe meal started with an amuse bouche served on an oversized plate.  It looked like something you\'d see in a parody of a super fancy restaurant.  Turnip soup was....turnip soup, I guess.  Turnips and cream.  The wacky oversized theme continued when I asked for the spoon that they had neglected to provide me with and I was given a serving spoon that I couldn\'t fit in my mouth.  The vegetables and sauce with the polenta were outstanding, but the polenta itself was way over-seasoned and impossible to enjoy the sauce with.  It was a tiny serving for ~$25, and, uh, it\'s corn.  There\'s no such thing as corn worth $25.  I was psyched about the valrhona sauce on the banana profiteroles, but it disappointed as well.  The whole dessert was heavy on the sugar and scratchy on my throat - reminiscent of when I used to OD on hershey\'s syrup as a kid.  The "ardoise" cocktail tasted like lemonade (i.e. boring), the camino cocktail was slightly better.  It was pretty hard to track down our server without waving our arms in the air, and the abundance of back waiters that someone else mentioned was absent during our visit.  \n\nBright spots were the chicken entree, which was well cooked, and the grits dessert.  Not worth returning for, though.']
["Got a tasting menu and sat ringside. I didn't think I would leave stuffed but I did."]
['Wow!  We went to celebrate our 15th anniversary and we truly celebrated.  We were treated to complimentary champagne and enjoyed every morsel of the 10 course tasting menu.  We loved not knowing what was coming next!  The courses move from light seafood to savory entrees to desserts and each one was as delicious or more delicious than the next!!  Chef Tony came by to personally introduce the main course and wished us a Happy Anniversary.  They even had a "Happy Anniversary" card for us, personally signed by him.  Everything was excellent!  My husband had our very attentive server Emily pair wines with the courses along the way.  She brought half-glasses which were perfect.  All were excellent!  The food is unbelievably fresh and flavorful and we ate things we probably never would have eaten otherswise but they were delicious!   Everything is fresh each day (organic is always the first choice) and some of the wines were from local co-ops and didn\'t even have names!  But they were delicious!  The service was also excellent.  You have a main server but you are cared for by just about any server who passes your table.  Your water glass will  never have a chance to be empty!\n\nI love that it is family owned and operated and much of the bistro\'s decor was handed down through generations of their family.  Do fill out the information card that comes along with your bill--the staff reads them every night.  They make absolutely everything from scratch and buy from small independent farms, distillers and wine makers.  And you can truly taste and appreciate how fresh everything is.  BTW, this is not a restaurant to bring kids to.\n\nWe\'ll most definitely go back and I\'m dying to try brunch!']
["After reading my review, the owner Marjorie Maws personally reached out to me to offer an explanation and apologize for our bad experience. Goes to show how much he cares about the place and the satisfaction of his clients. He even sent me and my husband a gift certificate to dine at the restaurant for free. While we haven't had a chance to return, we are impressed by his commitment to his clients"]
["I ordered 6-course degustation menu and it was very good. What I like best of all is service at Craigie on Main. Though I have dinner at upscale places rather often, this place is remarkable for its service! I think almost every waiter came to my table and asked how is my current course, for all six courses. Once I finished the course, it took no more than a inunute to wait until one of the waiters came and took an empty plate. The food itself is not what I particularly like, sometimes a bit heavy. The best course was slowly cooked char. It was soooo juicy, like sashimi, and cooked well at the same time. Waiters said they have special way to cook it. That was the thing not to be missed. Other stuff was very good, I clearly saw it and understand that, but not of my particular taste. That's why just 4 stars..."]
["A top drawer fine dining experience all the way around.  You'll pay for it, of course, but it is very satisfying that the quality of the food, the experience, and the service are all consistent with the price.\n\nWe had the tasting menu last night - 6 excellent courses - and the service featured a full remove of all silverware (used or not) for each course.  That speaks volume about the attention to detail."]
["Locally sourced ingredients + culinary mastery = Craigie on Main. No wonder this place was voted one of the top new restaurants across the US in GQ magazine (although the restaurant is not new, but the refurbished location is). \n\nService:\nGreat. Attentive. Punctual.\n\nFood:\nChanges all the time. But full of surprises. Don't go to Craigie if you are looking for a staple dish (unless you sit on the bar and have the burger...which is phenomenal). Speaking of the bar, was served one of the best cocktails I have had in Cambridge."]
['I went here for my birthday - its very pricey. I would say the vegetarian tasting menu is worthy of the price. The portions start out small but the main dish is the perfect size. So many dessert options! I was shocked. I am a big peanut butter fan, so the pb parfait hit the spot. Yum. My friend had the chicken as the main dish and she could not stop gushing about it. As we were leaving we saw a potato dish waiting to be served so we asked about it - since it looked so delicious. The dish was off the bar menu ...so I will be heading to Craigie soon to try out the bar drinks/food!']
["This is one hard review to write! \n\nI took my girlfriend to Craigie on Main Monday night for her half-birthday dinner. We both love French cuisine, so Craigie seemed like a great choice ... 4 stars on Yelp, great recommendations from several friends. I had high expectations for one of the best restaurants in the Boston area.\n\nI love the location and its close proximity to Central Square. The restaurant was packed on a Monday night, but we were seated immediately. Thank goodness for OpenTable! The dining area has simple decor, with an exposed brick wall, mirrors hanging on the wall, books sitting on a bookshelf, and a dining bar overlooking the open kitchen (huge plus!). The bar looked well-stocked, but I didn't try any of their cocktails. Check out the virtual tour on the website: http://craigie-on-main.everyscape.com/ \n\nCraigie changes and prints their menu every night to reflect the ingredients they receive that day. I like their attention to buying local natural and/or organic foods and their commitment to their values (http://www.craigieonmain.com/?page_id=14). \n\nThe service was excellent! The host recognized me immediately, because I had called earlier in the day to confirm my reservation. Our waitress Sarah was very detailed in her descriptions of the specials and menu items. We asked about the great bread (from Iggy's), and she even gave us some more to bring home! \n\nHere's the tough part about my review of Craigie: the food. We had the Vermont Organic Pork and Tasmanian Sea Trout. Both entrees were executed perfectly, presented extremely well, and were of good-sized portions. It's an upscale restaurant, so we didn't expect huge platters of food. Then we tried our food ... it was just underwhelming, vanilla, disappointing, lacking in flavor. The spice-encrusted pork rib was tasty, but the grilled pork belly and crispy suckling confit weren't spectacular. I simply did not think an establishment of this caliber should produce dishes without more of a punch. The Tasmanian sea trout was cooked very well, tender and just a bit raw in the middle. There was a sauce with a bit of a spicy kick, mussels and a bean of some type, too. Unfortunately, the fish didn't have much flavor and was bland. Regular salmon has more taste. Maybe it was the particular dishes we selected or the ingredients that they happened to select that day, I don't know. The prix-fixe menu looked great, and we decided that we would come back in the future to give that a try.\n\nGranted I had high expectations, but a $30-something per plate restaurant with a James Beard Award finalist chef, named one of the top restaurants in Boston should produce more exciting food. When our waitress asked how we were enjoying our meals, we were honest with her. She apologized, offered to get us something else, told us about their Chef's Whim tastings on Sunday nights and invited us to come back another day to give them another chance. She listened to our opinions and was sympathetic.\n\nNow here's the best part of it all ... when our check was supposed to arrive, they comped our meal and gave us a $50 gift card for our next visit!!! That was so unexpected and generous, and now we definitely have to try Craigie again! Honestly, I rarely find such great service, and it's so refreshing when I find a restaurant that actually cares about their customers. \n\nBased on my only on my experience with the particular entrees we had at Craigie last night, I would have given only 2 or 3 stars. With the excellent service, Craigie on Main has definitely earned 4 stars in my book. I will be updating my review after my next outing to Craigie. If anyone from the restaurant is reading this, I'll be back!"]
['A few weeks ago, I took my girlfriend here for the ten course tasting menu. I don\'t feel qualified to critique the food except to say that I even liked the dishes with primary ingredients that I hate (e.g. pork).\n\nWe opted for the "ringside seats" (their term, not mine). Basically, they\'re bar stools (with a back) at the edge of the kitchen; you can watch as the sous chefs prepare the food (we were at the salad/appetizer and desert end). The view was wonderful, but it\'s a long meal; if you don\'t like bar stools, I don\'t recommend it.\n\nOne thing we observed was that they\'re very picky about what food leaves the kitchen; several times we watched as dishes were redone because they either didn\'t look good enough, weren\'t large enough portions, or weren\'t cooked just the right amount.\n\nThe service was absolutely wonderful. As an example of how attentive the staff was, one of the staff managed to "top off" our water glasses even though we hadn\'t taken a drink since the last time they had been refilled. Chef Tony Maws himself served several of the dishes.\n\nA note - if you\'re interested in the tasting menu, don\'t make the reservations online; the day we wanted was listed as being almost entirely booked, but when I stopped by in person and mentioned we were interested in the tasting menu, they were very accommodating - I don\'t believe the "ringside seats" were included in the online system.']
['I went Craigie last night for dinner with a friend who I haven\'t seen in a while.  We decided to sit at the bar and it turned out to be a great experience.  Ted the bartender was great and let us chat and didn\'t interupt at all.  Watching him make those amazing drinks was pretty interesting.  We finally ordered a bottle of Beaujolais which was sooo smooth and delicious.  We also both ordered the "infamous" burger and it definitely met the hipe.  It came with huge steak fries and a little side salad which was a good touch to the dish  The first bite into the burger was amazing and it continued to be good.  The sides were a nice little touch and the spicy homemade ketchup was tasty!  We ordered the corn bread dessert which was also good.  It was served with vanilla ice cream and pineapple salsa.  Needless to say my first experience was great and I can\'t wait to go back and try the specialty drinks and all the other things on the menu.']
["The food is very good and the atmosphere is great, especially compared to the old location.  There's an excellent selection of affordable wines by the bottle and a good selection of rich French bar food.\n\nWhen it's busy, the waiting list for the bar is a little off-putting, but I am a fairly frequent customer here."]
['Second time was an improvement...\n\nAfter my previous review, the owner was actually nice enough to contact me personally and offer a chance to try the restaurant again.  \n\nI came with my boyfriend and requested to be seated in the bar area (where I had previously been so I could make a fair comparison).  We were a little late and I called to let them know, and they were very nice over the phone and thanked us for calling.  We were seated promptly and politely, and a very nice and spacious table at the back of the bar area.\n\nOur server was very polite and generally attentive, though my main issue was the timing of the service.  The bread came promptly but it took quite a while for the appetizer to come after that.  The main course came promptly after the appetizer, but the waitress came to ask us how the meal was before we even had one bite (too soon).  The main course was cleared at an appropriate time, but after we paid it took overly long for them to come take the check, and we ended up leaving the money on the table (thank goodness we paid cash not with a card, because that could have taken forever).  In general the service was polite and the servers were knowledgeable, but the timing needs a bit of work.\n\nMy boyfriend had the octopus appetizer, and they switched from chorizo sauce to carrot jus when he asked for this.  He enjoyed the dish very much.  I had the burger for dinner, and it was juicy though I asked for it very well done and there were areas that were quite pink so I would have called it "medium well" rather than well, and it was certainly NOT very well done as I would have liked.  Other than this, the salad was good and the fries were very tasty.  My boyfriend had the chicken, which was moist and very tasty as well.  \n\nOverall this experience was much better than the previous one, but I think the restaurant still has some kinks to work out in terms of the service timing.  Also, the prices are quite high for the overall experience.  It is a very nice restaurant but I would not call it one of the BEST restaurants in Boston, so I don\'t think that the prices should be as high as they are.  They are the same as the prices at Clio or Salts, and these two restaurants have flawless service flow and food presentation.  Again, nothing wrong with Craigie, but it is just not quite yet on par with the best places I\'ve been to.  \n\nI would come back, but not before trying a few other places I\'ve been meaning to check out.']
['I called ahead of time and was told there were many vegetarian options and the cooks were very flexible. It was a completely different story once we were seated. The menu had 0 vegetarian options. When we asked the waitress if the cooks could modify anything she became extremely rude. She left for 15 mins and returned to say the cooks would try to pull something together. We should have left. But I had faith that even though the waitress was an idiot the cooks were not.  The food was beyond disgusting. A plate of veggies soaked in BUTTER. Really- if I had ordered a meat dish I would have at least had pasta or something to go with, but I forgot vegetarians only eat tasteless lettuce. Yummy. Even dessert was awful.  I recommend Salt across the street over this place.']
["Hands down best restaurant in MA.  My date and I did the 10 course tasting....3 hours of bliss.  With each course we claimed it was the best dish we had tasted.... and every plate got better.\n\nOur server was flawless.  He was truly committed to making sure we got everything out of this experience.  He went out of his way to accommodate our request to create our own wine pairings (they don't offer wine pairings so we had him pick his own and split each glass in two for us).  He was a presence throughout the meal but yet gave us enough space to melt away.\n\nThe Craigie team has got service down to an art.  I don't think there was a single server who didn't, at some point in the night, bring us food or refill our water.  Hell, even the host staff and bus staff helped out.  We never waited on anything.  Everything we needed was already thought of and it was if the whole restaurant was taking care of us and us alone.  Truly amazing.\n\nBut it gets better.  We were seated right next to the open kitchen.  Yet not a single word was heard.  They operate like a well-oiled machine with Tony at the switchboard.  I am dumb-founded as to how they churn out these breath-taking dishes and yet make it look so easy.\n\nAt the last savory course Tony came to our table to thank us for dining.  Who does that?!  It is obvious he loves what he does and it was the perfect touch.  Tony, if you read this, don't ever get too big to forget how important this is.  You really made our night.\n\nI love so many Cambridge restaurants.  Salts, Oleana, Rendezvous. But Craigie is extra special.  It was like being at a magic show....I am still trying to figure out how they do it.  You really have to see to believe."]
["This restaurant is overpriced. The portions are small. Food isn't spectacular. The only good thing is a wine list. Nice restaurant but not worth the money."]
['Craigie on Main is hands down one of the best restaurants in Boston -- fresh, local ingredients cooked and seasoned to perfection. The service is outstanding and the ambiance is relaxed yet sophisticated. The open kitchen is a great touch. Dinner is great, but brunch is fantastic as well. Highly recommended.']
['Don\'t Arrive Without A Reservation.\nWe arrived on Monday night at 720pm without a reservation. We asked for bar seating and there was a line with two small parties ahead of us. Ok, no problem."How long is the wait?" Hostess: Not long at all. Would you like a drink while you wait? We: Sure.\n An hour and five minutes later we were seated. Stood the entire time. Their strategy is to tell you it won\'t be long. Then 20 minutes into the wait they tell "very soon". They keep you till they get you past the threshold point where you have waited too long to not leave. There were two other parties behind us. I roughly timed them. They waited 50 minutes and the other 46 minutes.\n  The staff knows it will take close to an hour at least to be seated in the bar. They don\'t tell you that. They smile at you, speak softly, suggesting you will be seated "soon".  If they told me Close To An Hour, I would have gone elsewhere. Like Cuchi Cuchi, maybe.\n  The food wasn\'t bad. Good food. The drinks are pretty good. Especially the bourbon. But neither worth the hour plus wait']
['Always Fabulous. I have been here for the Chefs Whim, The Whole Hog Dinner and countless times in between. The bar is always well cared for, it can be a great place to go with girlfriends for drinks or just to sit and have their amazing burger for a solo dinner. Their staff is knowledgable and passionate, they take their time and have great wine recs.  Their Offal is always incredable, highlights have been boidin noir, sweetbreads and all the pates are excellent. Dont miss the pigs tails on the bar menu!! Not cheap but sooo worth it, if I want huge plates of food w leftovers Ill head to Chinatown or the North End, when I want beautifully composed dishes in a perfect sequence Ill head to Craigie.']
["Craigie on Main: the gift that keeps on giving.  I currently have a neat little package waiting for me in the office refrigerator.  Inside are my leftovers from dinner last night and I am literally staring at the clock, counting down (and killing time writing this review) until it's a reasonable time to eat lunch.  Last night, I had the slow-roasted chicken and I can almost still taste it.  The chicken was so tender, I didn't need a knife, and with every forkful I picked up the beans, spinach, and puree served with it.  All of the flavors worked so well together (the sauce was rich but very light), and the textures complimented each other perfectly.  This entree is a hefty portion, so about halfway through I forced myself to slow down to ensure a leftover lunch large enough for today.  Of course it helped that we had started with the grilled octopus, ended with the gingerbread pain perdu, and padded the middle with bread and a bottle of wine.  We spent way too much money, but were too happy and full afterwards to care.  \n\nThings we commented on throughout the meal: the attentiveness of the staff, their knowledge of the menu, and their passion for the food and wine; how we saw a different server for each course of the meal; how the exposed kitchen was surprisingly calm, cool, and collected which made us feel comforted and well taken care of; and how most of the customers were twice our age and we should have had our parents take us there so they could treat.  Next time, for sure."]
["Craigie is just fine. The food is decent, but the dining area is below average. For the price, you'd expect better. \n\nIt's always busy, so they're obviously doing well. In the future, I'll use it only for ordering at the bar."]
["I can't say I was wowed by this place.  The food was very good,  excellent actually.  Great presentation as well.  The servers were knowledgeable and it was evident they had a great respect for their head chef's abilities!  Great wine selection.\n\nWhy three stars?  When spending $225 for a dinner for two I expect to be pleasantly full.  On the way home my husband and I joked at the temptation of stopping off for another dessert somewhere :("]
["decent menu, but the star of the show was clearly the burger. i don't think i've had anything better in boston! the bun was so fresh."]
["I wanted so much to like this restaurant. I had heard such good things from old friends who went to college with me in Boston... so I came in here with an old college friend to reminisce about the old days. The decor was lovely; the service was prompt. But the food was just not all I had expected it to be. The octopus appetizer was tasty-but a little bit on the chewy side. My halibut as the main course was just OK though--nothing spectacular and a little bit underseasoned. It didn't really taste like much of anything. And it came out cold! Maybe my main course was a fluke, but it definitely wasn't one I liked."]
["hands down my favorite place in Boston.  fantastic cocktails, exquisite food, great great people.  i come here on my own once or twice a week just to sit at the bar, have a cocktail or two and have the mussels for dinner.  \n\ni can't sing high enough praise for craigie, but in a way am also tempted to tell people to stay away - it's already hard enough to get a seat at the bar anyway ;)"]
['Magnificent cocktails.  Entertaining service.  OUTSTANDING tasting menu.  Perfectly-paired wine.  Expensive; worth it.  Best meal I ever had.  Come here someday.']
["Think about what your favorite restaurant in Boston does, and then go to Craigie only to discover that Craigie does it better.  This is true whether one is talking about cocktails, comforting pork dishes, sashimi or service.\n\nI've been dining at Craigie since it originally opened in 2003 at its original location on Craigie Street.  So this review is based on eight years of experience and I dare estimate 125-150+ meals at Craigie over that period of time.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  In addition to the fact that his restaurant is absolutely packed at 9pm on a Sunday night (when you can hear crickets at many other establishments), Chef/owner Tony Maws has recently been awarded the James Beard Award for Best Chef Northeast (an award for which he has been nominated since 2009) and is regularly lauded in local, national and even international media as a chef who always offers the absolute best for his loyal patrons.  If that's not enough to convince you, then you should have a chat with some of the notable chefs that have dined at Craigie like El Bulli's Ferran Adria.  If Julia Child was still alive and residing in Cambridge, I could easily imagine her sitting at the end of the bar, fingers and lips wrapped around a Craigie burger!\n\nSo much can be said and has been said about the food at Craigie, but so much more needs to be said about the people who make the magic happen at Craigie.  If you've never had the pleasure of chatting with members of Maws' fantastic staff (or Maws himself), I suggest that you do.  They come from varied pasts such as 3-Michelin star restaurants and local Cambridge eateries, but they all bring a single,  uncompromising level of service to your table that is without parallel in Boston, to say nothing of beyond the environs of Boston.  Their care for the customer is genuine and it shows.\n\nMy advice to you: go in with all guns blazing and order the 6 or 10 course tasting menu.  Maybe open with a cocktail or two and throw in a bottle of wine.  Over the years, I've brought in dozens of friends, family members and colleagues for this experience and all were absolutely delighted.  Without prompting, many of them still talk about the happy experience months and years after the fact.  I can empathize as some of my happiest memories at at Craigie, and I know you'll have more than a few such memories once you dine there."]
['Go to Craigie.  Bring a friend.  Chat with the bartender.  Try some bitters.  Imbibe cocktails.  Get the pig for two.  Perfect night.']
["Criagie on Main started life as the Craigie Street Bistro, a small, cramped venue on Craigie Street. Now it's in a bigger, nicer place on Main with a gleaming open kitchen but the tables are still almost touching. If you move your arms too much you could knock something over on the next table. This was my first visit to the new place. We were four for dinner on a Saturday night.\nThe tasting menus are flexible and let you get practically anything from the menu. The wine list is huge and the servers are knowledgeable and helpful.\nI had a nice trio of terrines, a lovely halibut and a great assortment of cheeses with a very good viognier-llike wine.\nSo, why only four stars? I have had to ask twice for water refills, something that should not happen in this kind of restaurant. One server was right to say that she was sorry I had to ask.\nThe prices are high and the noise level very lively."]
["Had a great Prix Fixe here last night, the Kampachi Sashimi may have been the best thing i've ever eaten in my life.  Our table wasn't ready when we arrived, so they comped us our delicious libations at the bar, without us asking- such great service.  Our table was ready after only about 10 minutes, and it was worth the wait. Looking forward to come back and try the brunch here."]
['i have had few meals so delicious in my entire life.\ni have also had few cocktails so complex and special in my entire life.\nadd to that, the service is attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly.\nbesides the price tag, this place is essentially perfect.']
["This place doesn't need an additional 5 star review. But I have to give it one anyway. Firstly, the service is par-excellence. Food-wise highly highly recommend the crispy fried pig's tails and the grilled octopus. Their main course was just as good as the appetizers. Only 3 stars for the dessert though. They were too sorbet heavy which was not to our taste. We definitely plan to go back for their 8-course tasting menu."]
["Another trip to Craigie, another fantastic dinner.  Currently prego, but still craving the deliciousness that comes from that kitchen, I rattled off the list of what I can't eat.  The kitchen prepared an awesome tasting menu with both vegetarian and meat options (I remarked that pork belly was my kind of vegetarian food).  It was amazing.  My husband enjoyed his full-on fish/meat tasting.  Dessert was fabulous, and I really can't say enough about the service.  Already looking forward to the next visit."]
['I strolled in for a spot at the bar with a friend at 8:00 on a Friday. We knew we were truly gambling- trying to eat out in Boston on the weekend is near impossible even at the mediocre places, let alone the reputable ones like Craigie. The staff was kind, welcoming, and utterly accommodating. Although there was no room for us right away, they took our names and constantly checkied in with us to let us know how long it would be, to freshen our drinks, and to see how we were.\n\nThe atmosphere is a bit hectic with a lot of rushing around on a busy weekend night, so I recommend the dining room, not the "chef\'s table" or the bar area, and a corner table if possible. There it is charming and cozy.\n\nThe food was fabulous, creative, ultr-fresh, and obviously prepared with a great deal of knowledge and care. I am super hard to please and have found few truly skilled restaurants in Boston. Along with Ten Tables, this is now one of my favorites. We had the veggie mushroom ragout, the salmon for two, sauteed squash and a vegetable plate. Everything was very fresh. We chose a lot of veggies because they are purchased from local farms and the salmon because it was wild Alaskan (in season) and all were spectacular. After some arguing over the dessert menu, we chose the fruit crisp. Despite the unpromising name, this was simply one of the best desserts I have ever had, with very fresh caramelized slightly tart local apples and topped with homemade iced cream. The meal was supplemented by an amuse bouche and two dessert palate cleansers, all phenomenal. I would like to see a slightly fuller selection of red wines by the glass. Otherwise, everything was perfect.']
["It's been far, far too long since I've Yelped anything, but it seems quite appropriate that my first review after such a long hiatus is one of the best meals I've had in a perhaps even longer. I was actually at Craigie for their opening, but wasn't there long enough to form an impression other than that the decor was a huge improvement over La Groceria's. That isn't really saying much, but I would say that Craigie on Main has one of the most attractive, modern dining areas that I've seen in the area, and their fully open kitchen does a lot for the atmosphere of the place.\n\nBut on to the food. Their menu is renewed daily based on whatever the best, freshest ingredients they can get that morning are. The menu last night, for example, had been printed at 5:08 pm that day (putting that info on the menu was, I thought, a nice touch). I decided to go with seafood and had the Spanish octopus with chorizo oil appetizer followed by the Irish Sea trout and finished off with the white corn grits dessert. The octopus was among the best I've ever had, and was certainly a dish where the attempt at ultimate freshness really shines through. It was completely not rubbery as you might expect from other octopus dishes you've eaten. In fact it was even more tender than I knew octopus was capable of being and had a fantastic texture to match (and I'm a big octopus fan). The same was true for the trout. It looked more like salmon than any trout that I've ever seen, but certainly tasted like the freshest trout you've ever had. It was lightly seasoned such that you thought you were eating it straight out of the sea, and was paired with equally delicious rock shrimp and mussels. The mussels, it's worth mentioning, were also the best I've ever had. In the past I've thought I didn't like mussels and so avoided them; I actually almost didn't order the trout because the menu said it was served with mussels, but I'm glad I did. As with everything else, they were so fresh, and so well prepared that the only word that can even come close to adequately describing them is delicious.\n\nThis is probably not a place that I would go for dinner often, but the quality of the food is so good and the prices, though high, so appropriate, that it's certainly been put at the top of the list of places to go for a nice night out. Having lived literally right around the corner from this place not too long ago, I can say that Craigis on Main is a fantastic addition and is definitely going to be doing its part to drag Central Square, kicking and screaming, into the realms of classiness."]
["We celebrated our wedding anniversary at Craigie on Main this weekend and all I can say is UNBELIEVABLE. If you love food and can afford to splurge, get your bootie to Craigie ASAP. Get the 10 course tasting menu, sit at the chef's table, and prepare to enjoy every minute. To see pictures of our meal and my husband's review of the night, check out http://www.seedancook.com/2009/07/12/craigie-on-main/."]
["Big improvement over the old place.  Doesn't feel as humid, dank, and claustrophobic as the old location. The most impressive open kitchen I've ever seen.\n\nOrder the hanger steak."]
['We dined at the bar and, to be fair, we only ordered wine and a side. Both were not to our taste. We ordered 3 different glasses of wine and only one was any good. The others were weak and vinegar-y in our opinion. We ordered a side of the bone marrow, which comes with bread. The bone marrow side was probably one of the worst bone marrow preparations we have ever had. After ordering this side, we decided we did not need to sample any more of the food. The other patrons plates looked very unadorned, small portions, and unimpressive to us in any visual way. There was nothing to tempt us.\n\nUpdate: the business did offer to reimburse us or to comp us some future food to allow us to taste things that might be more to our liking. We may take them up on it since it has been so many years and things may have changed. At this point it is worth giving them another try. Will update my review once we have dined again.']
["Arguably the most expensive meal I've ever paid for, but totally worth it.  I'd go back in a heartbeat... well, maybe after I've saved up some more $$ or if someone else was offering to pay.  Drinks were very tasty, food was very tasty, wine was very tasty.  An added bonus: Chef Tony presented our final savory course... awesome."]
['This is, hands down, the best restaurant in the Boston area. The service is incredible. The kitchen staff is professional. And the food is amazing. Try it once and it will be your favorite restaurant too.']
["Maybe my last 6 years in SF have tainted me but What a huge let down...\n\nThe food was really heavy, a lot of flavor but in some dish and not enough in others. My hanger steak was pretty good but there was way to much peppercorn, seriously I started coughing on a few bites. My wifes fish on the other hand had no taste, Or friends got the duck which was ok and the chicken which was good but no better then a 10 dollar whole chicken from russo's or whole foods. These are $30-38 entrees they really need to step it up. The Service was good but for $60+ per person the food fell way short. I am not sure what all the hype is a bout but I would skip this joint for sure.\n\nSECOND VISIT\nI need to add to my post and have added 2 stars, after my 1st  review I was contacted by the owner, they comped us another meal and this time it was much better. I had chicken 3 ways and wife had the fish special both were very good. Our drinks apps and dessert were also very good. \n\nOn another note local business should pay much closer attention to their reviews. Cragie definitely cares about this and value their customers experience."]
["french deliciousness! service is great and the donuts are amazinggg. everything is made fresh to death. good for dinner and brunch. their burgers are soo good! next time i'm in the neighborhood with a big appetite i will try out the tasting menu."]
["Absolutely loved!  Had the chef's menu 6-course tasting.  Everything was delightful, especially the handmade pasta and squid noodles.  The service was impeccably friendly and accommodating.  The perfect place for a special occasion."]
['I had the Prix fixe Sunday Brunch with free tea and coffee for $29 with 2 friends.  The Jasmine Pearl was so fragrant, that I was almost distract by it.  \nWe all had basically the same thing, fruit salad, scallops with corn oatmeal kind of thing.  And rice pudding type of thing for desert.  Every course was delightful, and the servers were so cute and helpful:).']
['Tony Maws runs an excellent restaurant where - so it seems - every table is occupied by happy diners.  The concise seasonal menu offers something for all tastes and the carefully sourced dishes are executed with superior skill and care.  We admired a fritto of greaseless and impeccably fresh smelts and the ragoût composed of mushrooms, house-made sausage, cock\'s combs, and various fall vegetables.  A juicy (and very tasty) chicken over polenta made for a very satisfying main course, as did the local pork prepared three ways - melt-in-your mouth suckling pig, unctuous pork belly, and a rib that featured a faintly Asian rub (star anise).  The gingerbread pain pedu was outstanding, light yet rich, its sweetness accentuated by an intense pineapple sauce.  The service is knowledgeable and attentive.  One small gripe: while I applaud the trend of restaurants to serve filtered tap water (both still and carbonated), I think that charging $7 per carafe is a bit much.\n\nThe kitchen, with its fascinating ballet of chefs concentrating on their various tasks, is in full view and (at least for me) endlessly fascinating.  Many diners love this "openness."  I find the strong, often intrusive smells (from frying) a bit distracting.']
["Wow...what a wonderful dining experience. Completely unpretentious. Totally delivered on the food. Great service. (Shout out to our waiter Jonathan).\n\nWent to dinner on 7/13. Reservations and all for my Bday dinner. During the day C.O.M. called my lady to inform her the A/C was broken. Very courteous. We arrived anyways, albeit early to see if we could handle the heat. We ended up snaging a table in the bar area (A/C working slightly there). Couldn't have been happier we stuck it out. They started us off with complimentary N/A beverages to cool us down. Amuse-bouche's (can you pluralize that?) followed, including a duck prosciutto that was elegant. \n\nWe began our meal splitting the Crispy-Fried Pigs' Tails(pickled peanuts, nuoc cham, cilantro), My lady who is at times reluctant to try certain adventurous foods was persuaded by the waitor who described them as the best spareribs ever. And they were. Succulent, crispy, savory fat-lace pig tails. Mmm. Nice work Jonathan (Again, our waiter)\n\nFor the entrees, our waiter suggest the Striped bass as it was a daily menu item, being the first day of striped bass season. Usually when at a new place we try and get two entrees and split them. Well we couldn't resist both ordering the bass. It was nothing short of perfection. Ramsey would have been proud. Ill try to get more details on what it came with but it was an Olive-oil poached, line caught striped bass served with little-necks. The fish was cooked perfectly. Moist but firm, crispy skin. Nice work C.O.M! Legals, Skipjack's, Kingfish, B&amp;G have never cooked me something this well.\n\nFor Dessert we had a Panna Cotta. Again, Boom goes the dynamite. The mark of a good Panna Cotta is when you are completely full and can handle no more, you polish the entire dessert off.\n\nThen, compliments of the house (not sure if all this was b/c they liked us, it was my birthday or bc of the faulty A/C but worth it) we were given small Rhubarb-Hibiscus Mousse, Yogurt Foam. All flavor, no fill, food technology is getting so cool.\n\nCan't wait to go back for the burger. Looked bomb...kept seeing them stroll by me. Also the pig's head. Sonds so cool. \n\nFarm to table, a menu tailored to what's fresh, unpretentious dining, great service...this is what a restaurant should be. It lived up to its hype and then blew past that hype..."]
['My wife and I have been dined here for brunch (many times) and dinner (3 times).  We were always pleased with the experience, service, and food.  Food has always been exceptional.  I would rate the service 4 (attentive and professional, but not that exceptional).  Atmosphere is always laid-back.']
["We went for brunch today and they were having a special prix fixe menu to support the Greater Boston Food Bank. This was by far one of the best meals I've had in Boston. I can't wait to go back for dinner.\n\nWe ate at the bar since we didn't have reservations and I think if I went back I would probably sit at the bar again. Great to people watch and the bartenders are all great. It's nice that they don't make you stalk people for their seats and have an order. I've honestly never seen that at any restaurant. \n\nI started with the fruit salad and yogurt, which was perfect while my husband had the fresh doughnut. The doughnut was warm and perfect. I had 2 eggs sunnyside up and the skirt steak. The skirt steak was PERFECTLY cooked and PERFECTLY seasoned. My husband ordered the burger, which was good but not amazing. I think I prefer my burgers to be more classic and I didn't particularly like the sauce on it. The fries were ok, but I don't particularly like shoestring fries, so that's just probably a personal preference. The burger was well cooked though. \n\nI had the fruit crisp with ice cream for dessert, which was good but nothing stellar and my husband had the profiteroles with peanut butter ice cream, which was also good."]
["As if Craigie and Chef Maws need another gushing review.  This place is simply the best.  Maybe the best restaurant I've ever been to.  The hostesses, servers, and bartenders are all top notch.  Never had anything less than a fantastic time.  The burger is orgasmic... cocktails are expertly shaken... and the vino is on point.  Try the burger, the pigs tails, pretty much anything, and you'll fall in lust.  Tony Maws is slowly climbing up my (short) man-crush list... Eddie Vedder, Tom Brady, Ben Harper, Tony Maws..."]
["Craigie is responsible for one of my best dining experiences yet in Boston.  Everything from the staff, to the drinks, and especially the food were exactly what I thought it'd be and more!  There were four of us dining together and every dish was delish, however, we are all still talking about the pig's head we ordered!  If you are an adventurous eater, you HAVE to get this.  The meat was tender (and, of course, fatty in places), and eating the head was an experience none of us will ever forget.  The staff was very knowledgeable at explaining every part of the pig's head to us (including texture and general likability) and they were very encouraging when we were hesitant to eat the eye (which, b-t-dubs was the best part).  Seriously, go there and eat your heart out, and be sure to get the pig's head, and a tasty cocktail to boot."]
["Excellent all around! Eat here, you won't be sorry you did. Top notch food, impeccable service, warm &amp; welcoming atmosphere. Have the smelts with squid ink sauce as a starter."]
["We started with the chef's whim on Sunday's about 5 years ago, and we have been hooked ever since.  \n\nI would recommend Craigie to anyone."]
["Craigie on Main lives up to the hype.\n\nThe space is a bit tight, but very intimate. Almost every spot in the dining room has a view right into the working kitchen. This feature makes the dining experience both fun and intensely intriguing. In so many other restaurants your order goes off into the great unknown, only to have your food magically appear with no real connection to its creation. Chef Tony Maws whirls around his perfectly functioning kitchen like Belichick patrols the sideline at Gillette. He knows his players and his plays. It it obvious, to watch him, that he is seeing everything five steps ahead. Mesmerizing.\n\nThe food...ohhhhhh the food...I started with the Trio of Terrines. The foie gras was other worldly. Our waiter helped steer some decision making for us when ordering dinner. It was remarkable to have a waiter that actually stopped for a few moments to explain and discuss the menu with you. I decided on the Beef Ribeye, partially because of the accompanying roasted bone marrow. My wife opted for the Sable-fish in miso broth with razor clams and squid. Both were very well executed. The beef was one of the finer pieces of meat I have ever come across. The bone marrow and creamed spinach were both rich and flavorful accompaniments. The final piece to our dining puzzle was a last minute decision. At the waiter's suggestion we opted for the brussel sprouts roasted in duck fat. These just sounded too good to pass up. I mean, how can you pass up anything roasted in duck fat? To say the least, they were spot on.\n\nWe ended with a gingerbread cake with fresh ginger ice cream and a pineapple sauce. The contrast of the sweet pineapple and fresh ginger ice cream on top of the warm gingerbread cake was heavenly. \n\nThe meal, overall, was aces. Though the prices are steep, the full experience is more than worth it. Craigie is a must for any foodie...especially those excited about snout to tail dining. My only regret is that I did not opt for the half roasted pig's head, though the look on my wife's face when the option was presented to us may have made up for that...priceless. \n\nIf you have not experienced Craigie on Main, now is the time. If you have, you already know what I'm talking about."]
["We went to Craigie after hearing rave reviews from our friends who had their burger for brunch.  I got the scallops with corn polenta and my husband got the burger.  The burger is smaller than your average burger at other restaurants so if you are a big eater, you may need to get an additional side to fill you up.  Overall we thought the dishes were good but not great.  It's definitely on the pricey side so going there for brunch will cost you about $18 - $25 for an entree depending on what you order.  Not sure whether their food is worth the craving to go back but it is a good restaurant so it is worth trying at least once.  4 stars for the food but 3 stars for the price."]
['ASTOUNDING, I\'ve been knocked over with a feather named Marjorie Maws. \n\nMarjorie Maws, co-owner of Craigie on Main, read my abridged review, and contacted me. She asked for every detail of our miserable evening.  I explained.  In prompt responses, here\'s some of what she wrote: "Thanks for taking the time to post about your visit. Obviously there were some problems the service and, on behalf of our management, we are terribly sorry. I would like to get to the bottom of it so I can make things right for you, and make sure nothing similar never happens again... We really pride ourselves on our service and hospitality so I would like to do whatever I can (and whatever would feel right to you) to fix the situation...Obviously the situation was mismanaged....We welcome any and all feedback and act on it immediately- I only wish this wasn\'t from 3 months ago as it will be difficult to figure out who might have been on duty that night. I am sorry for whatever series of glitches must have ruined your evening and we deeply apologize...Of course, we\'d still like a chance to show you that your experience was an aberration ." \n\nMarjorie offered to issue a refund for the exact amount of the meal, or give us a free meal on her.  We opted for the refund.  A copy of the transaction was provided by American Express.  Marjorie sent my partner a check in the mail for the exact amount within days. Unbelievable. In all my years of dining, this has NEVER happened. Marjorie has blewn me away, created a blustery draft in my perception, and in my future expections.  Well done.']
["We must have gone on a bad night. They seated us about 15 minutes late despite having a reservation. The pig's head was extremely fatty. Something we ate, we think it might have been the Pate, made the whole table sick for a day. Even the steak was just ok."]
["If you live anywhere near Cambridge, love food and have not been to Cragie On Main, do yourself a favor! The ambiance is buzzing with customers excited to experience the menu and it does not disappoint! Don't miss the octopus, the bone marrow, the burger and the brussels (in duck fat!). And of course, don't miss the cocktails...I loved the 3-2-1!\n\nServers are great too! Enjoy!"]
["My wife and I were in town from Philadelphia celebrating our 5 year anniversary with 2 of our great friends from Boston. My friend recommended here saying it was a very good restaurant. After reading reviews and researching, we agreed to go. Upon walking in, my friend noticed the Chef was not in the kitchen. We should have just left then.  But we didn't. We sat at our table, which seemed to be in the middle of the servers paths and began our meal. The full Craigie  experience, with the addition of fiddlehead ferns cooked in duck fat. I won't bore you with a course by course, plate by plate, but will just give you the lowlights. There were barely any highlights.  The aforementioned  ferns were charred to a crisp with absolutely no taste. Like they were some how charred while being cooked in water. One course was salmon collar, which would have been better served with the meat scraped out and offered as an amuse. Rather it was served with a jicama and Asian pear slaw, I did not realize it was the year 1995. It also had a sea salt accompaniment. I'm not sure what kind because the server and food runners didn't even mention it. It just appeared.  The only bright spot was dessert, and I normally don't get dessert because I order heavy on the food side. Luckily I was still hungry and needed something more to eat. Our bill for four was in the mid $700's, can't remember exactly. And we did have drinks and wine. Service-poor. Food-disappointing. Atmosphere-loud, whoever Jill is in the kitchen better get her act together as her name was heard yelled all through dinner, which is annoying since it is my wife's name as well. Perceived value-in the pooper. Maybe when Chef is there things are different but it's his failure as well if they are that bad in his absence.    This was the Saturday of the Kentucky Derby.  Next visit to Boston will not include this destination."]
["I love this place. Consider eating at the bar - so fun to watch the most expert bartenders mix up drinks. They're super friendly too.\nI find the food a little too fancy for my taste - something that is wrong with me, not them. It is truly impressive. They take perfectionism to a whole new level. Excellent service."]
['Let me preface this by saying I this is the most $ I\'ve ever spent on a meal and drinks in my life. This probably made the experience even more special for me. To celebrate my boyfriend\'s birthday, we enjoyed the 10 course tasting. The service was spectacular. The owner left a card on our table for my boyfriend\'s birthday. I really appreciated this personal touch. We had to wait 10 minutes for our table so our first few drinks were free! Not expected at all, what 10 minutes? They actually took 3 drinks off the bill. I now know what judges on Top Chef are talking about when they refer to "the marrying of flavors, and using texture to compliment a dish." This place is a grand architect of food and drinks. I have never had a drink with both juniper and sage and it was extraordinary. The 10 course tasting is not for the faint of heart, it is a lot of food, but spread out so it is not overwhelming. This process does take up to 3hours. This is totally worth it and something I recommend everyone try at least once. Apologies, there were so many complex parts to our 10 courses I couldn\'t name them all, but I devoured ever morsel. If you are going for a special occasion the staff are so attentive they truly make you feel special. If you are willing to throw down some big $, this is the place to do it.']
['I went here for a Christmas treat and was not disappointed.  I got the tasting menu, and it was very worth it.  The food was top-notch, and the service was excellent.  Its too expensive to go here regularly, but its totally worth it for special occasions.']
['Wow, this place had amazing food. Not amazing prices, but definitely amazing food. We had the 6-course tasting menu, and my one complaint is that the waiter could not give us ANY idea what would be on it before we ordered. He said it was the chef\'s choice, and it varied from day to day, but you\'d think he could at least tell us what kinds of ingredients were likely to be served. In any case, we took the plunge and ordered it, and were pleased to note that he did ask if we had any allergies, particular dislikes (sweetbreads, etc.) or anything the chef needed to know.\n\nFirst came a trio of seafood-- there was a tartare of smoked fish topped with tiny potato chips and caviar, which was good and not too "fishy" for my tastes. The sashimi of smoked fish with the skin still on was unfortunately on the fishy side for me, and the texture left much to be desired. Hunks of raw fish with skin on are not fun to put in one\'s mouth. The last was a bite of octopus (cut to be almost noodle-like) with a yellow beet salad and citrus vinaigrette. Very refreshing, though I still had to have a sip of wine and some bread to get the fishy taste of the skin-on sashimi out of my mouth.\n\nNext we had a tiny salad of fennel, shiso, avocado, and thin slices of trout, with more citrus vinaigrette. My husband thought the trout added nothing, and would\'ve been fine eating the salad alone, but I think it added richness to the dish. Very good, though it needed  touch more acidity.\n\nNext was a giant seared scallop with a fennel puree and some other components I can\'t really remember. The scallop was excellent, though.\n\nNext was foie gras with persimmon puree, candied pistachios, and a paper-thin slice of candied persimmon, served with brioche toast. I would\'ve preferred if the foie gras weren\'t quite so chilled-- it was definitely cooler than room temp and the flavor didn\'t spread over the tongue until it got warmed up in my mouth. As it was, the temperature made it feel a little congealed, not as indulgent-- my favorite preparation for foie gras is to have it seared, so you get some textural contrast. Good flavors, though.\n\nNext was pork belly with some sort of wilted greens, and you\'ll have to forgive me if I can\'t recall all the accompaniments, because I was just so wrapped up in the meat. It was incredible. The texture, the flavor, everything. I\'d never had pork belly before and always thought the fattiness would be a turnoff-- boy, was I wrong. It was perfect.\n\nFor the next course, Chef Tony came out to serve us the venison with potatoes and "Cape Cod olives" (I think). This was my husband\'s favorite course, though I still have to hold out for the pork belly. The venison was very tender, but the flavor just couldn\'t compare to the previous dish.\n\nNext came a series of desserts. They brought out two small glasses, both filled with sour milk panna cotta-- one was infused with jasmine tea, one with orange. The jasmine tea was subtle but definitely the best. Texture was spot-on.\n\nNext was another pairing-- I got a dish of sweet grits with stewed apples, pears, and other fall fruits, and a cinnamon ice cream (though it tasted more like a sherbet, and I could swear I heard another waiter tell another diner it was Meyer lemon sorbet). It reminded me of breakfast in autumn, though it wouldn\'t have been my first choice for a dessert. My husband got a napoleon filled with coffee cream, which had a strong coffee flavor but needed another dimension to it. Not bad, but not spectacular.\n\nFinally (and you\'ll notice this is the 9th course of a 6-course menu) they brought out tiny cups of very thick Valrhona hot chocolate, spiked with cinnamon, cardamom, and pepper. Well-balanced, chocolatey, and a nice finish to the meal.\n\nOverall, it was totally worth the price. We spent 2.5 hours there, and despite the tiny size of each dish we walked away stuffed. I can\'t imagine how we could\'ve eaten the 10-course tasting menu! We are absolutely going back for our next special occasion!']
["Yeah, I can go into a long review about how great the food and atmosphere are, but really lets be honest, it doesn't need to be hashed out--the place is incredible, simple as that."]
["Delicious food and very innovative cocktails, served with flair by bartenders who are clearly mugging for the clientele. Quite the experience, but bring some cash. It's pricey."]
['We had a lovely dinner with our son and daughter-in-law. Someone had given them a gift certificate as a wedding gift (great idea for wedding attendees!). We sat in the bar area not in the "view the kitchen" area and it was better for our purposes, that is catching up with our kids. The atmosphere is cozy, the service excellent (thank you, Alex) and the menu inventive. All of us left feeling like we had had a special evening, indeed!']
["My experience here for dinner last night was a little up and down.  I had very high expectations going in.  The atmosphere was quite nice, the service was well paced, and I did have a few moments when trying my friend's app and entree when I experienced fireworks on my tongue from the deliciously unexpected flavor combinations.  She had the scallop cevice and the sea trout.  I, however, found both my app (grilled octopus) and entree (corvina) to be much too salty.  That was disappointing.  I wish I had said something to the staff, because all I could really take away from my eating experience was salty salty salty.  Also, I asked my server for a wine pairing with the corvina and I felt like her choice did not complement my food very well.\n\nDesserts and cocktails were heavenly.  The menu was heavy on foams, which was a little gimmicky.  I tried dishes including green apple foam, leek foam, and banana foam... Oh well.  I love what they're trying to do and I'll hope my overly salty food was just a fluke."]
['Ate here for Sunday brunch.  Excellent!\n\nStarted off with coffee and a fried doughnut in Dulce du Leche.  Moved on to some creamy grits with shrimp and lobster sauce as my entree.  Also tasted some of the corned beef hash and lox bagel entrees, all so good!  Ended with pannacotta, just fabulous.\n\nTo top it all off, sat "ringside" and watched all the dishes being created, we had a blast!']
["Craigie on Main is the real deal. The New Year's brunch was inspired, as was the previous meal there. Impeccable food and service."]
["I have been here once before for dinner and wasn't too impressed with the food. The saving grace of the meal was the wine. This leads me to my experience at the bar. First, get there EARLY. Doors open at 5:30, you be there at 5:30. The bar is small and was full by 5:45 and stayed that way for the entire evening. The bartender was absolutely wonderful. He was extremely knowledgeable and was more than willing to give a sample tasting of anything. The bar hosts a fantastic selection of great finds (local and imports.) The only Debbie-Downer of the evening was the entree. It wasn't terrible, but Betty Crocker could have knocked out a better potato dish from a box. That being said, the bar is totally worth spending your time (and money) there."]
['Came here a second time and the experience was even better than the first. We tried the usual items from the a la carte menu but also got the Veal for Two special and it was off the hook awesome. John and Ted at the bar were as always incredibly helpful in mixing us off-the-menu drinks that I would never be able to even begin imagining. Will definitely be coming again soon.']
['Hands down the absolute best restaurant in Boston.  Everything is perfect and well thought out.  The servers are incredible but not stuffy.  The bartenders are great.  The food is incredible- creative, well thought out, and perfectly executed.  The burger- amazing, the pig tails- sounds weird- but they are insanely good.  After so many letdowns at other Boston restaurants my wife and I decided to save our money and eat here as much as we can.  The bone marrow- to die for.  The pates- with homemade condiments- ridicuously good.  Best chef in Boston- hats off- you better win the James Beard award- you deserve it!']
["Craigie on Main has taken over the space previously occupied by LaGroceria for almost four decades.  They have done a great job reinventing the space and making it more modern (let's just say it really needed a facelift).  The kitchen is fully open to the restaurant and connects the dining room space to the bar/lounge area both or which are in their original locations.\n\nThe menu is reasonably diverse although the bar menu is heavy on the pork.  I suppose that is to be expected given the previous incarnation of this restaurant.  Opening weekend has just concluded and the place was packed both nights.  It is nice to see yet another high end restaurant in Central Square with great food and a good atmosphere.\n\nParking is a few blocks away if you park yourself although they do offer valet parking.  Your best bet would be to park at LeMeridien Cambridge.  Reservations are strongly suggested and you can make them on Open Table.  If you don't have reservations and the wait is too long, see if you can get a seat at the Chef's table at Sidney's Grille in LeMeridien with their new chef, Jim Little.  It is an experience sure to delight.  Better yet make a reservation and make that the next culinary experience you have in Central Square."]
["This is, hands down, the best restaurant I've ever been to. I've done a few tastings as well as stopped in for drinks and dessert, and every time I go I'm amazed by the knowledgeable and attentive staff, the casually beautiful ambiance, and the absolutely amazing food. An anecdote: One of my least favorite foods is mushrooms. I have always hated them. At Craigie, I have had no fewer than four mushroom dishes, and each one was spectacular. No exaggeration. I brought a friend from out of town here, and though she'd heard me rant about the excellence for years, even she got more than she expected. And the bar--oh my god. The best wines and mixed drinks I've had ANYWHERE. The servers can tell you every detail about everything, if you're a foodie and want to know everything. The last tasting I did, Chef Tony came over with our final savory course and even he took the the time to answer a question I had about its preparation. It's the best dining experience of my life, every time I go. Can't recommend it highly enough."]
["It doesn't get any better than Craigie. My girl took me here for my birthday and even with the bar set high, they exceeded my expectations. The food is top-notch. The only negative feedback was that our waitress was well informed but had no sense of humor. That put a bit of a damper on the mood."]
["Dined here on a Sunday evening for the Chef's Whim.  This was a lot of fun, a great deal, and an opportunity to sample several items on the menu.  If you're a picky eater, this is not for you, as the kitchen simply serves up whatever they feel like serving up that evening.  Enjoyed myself thoroughly and planning to return to try some items on the regular menu sometime."]
['WOW...what a kick!\nThis was a pure happenstance dining choice. I was at MIT, I searched Yelp for the nearest high rated restaurant and walked in and got seated...at one of the 4 seats at the counter looking into the kitchen. (I got there 15 minutes after they opened, but if you were any later than that there can be substantial waiting times)\nI was there on business, and alone (that is not a special occasion with my sweetee), so when I looked at the menu with price numbers at the top for tasting set, or prix fixe...I nearly dropped my eye teeth (I hadn\'t bothered to look at the details on yelp beforehand). More than what I\'d normally opt for.... but that said... for me...and that night... WHAT A BLAST!\nOK, first, it can be a real expensive meal (mine was $125 with 3 glasses of wine and getting just the main course and dessert). Second, don\'t sit at the counter if you want to have a relaxing meal...there\'s just too much activity going on around you, but was a real kick for me to watch all that ENERGY! There were 10 people in the kitchen cooking and a head chef coordinating it all, not to mention the "runners" heading out with the food for the dining tables. But this was just a perfect entertainment for me and I thoroughly enjoyed the precision, detail, and choreography that was right there in front of me. To watch small pieces of various adornments put down with tweezers, as well as watch the head chef send a plate back to be re-plated if it wasn\'t perfect was just plain fun.\nThe entire staff was there to make it an informative, enjoyable and tasty experience. They appeared to take great pride in explaining the nuances of whatever they brought out for you to try.\nMy main course for the evening was the Cod. Incredible! The fish, and every bite of the accompaniment was a taste treat. Now I\'m not a big eater, so the portion was perfect, but someone with a heartier appetite might think otherwise. I had the dessert which was a chocolate tart with... White Chocolate Miso ice cream... you got it... I said "miso"... (Japanese fish base). Someone was obviously trying to get very creative. It added a very interesting complexity to it, but I\'m not quite a fan, but glad I tried it.\nI\'d definitely come back, but will have to save up my pennies... and make sure I bring my wife with me so we can enjoy the experience together.\n(note: I didn\'t give it a perfect rating because I can see that this place isn\'t for everyone as you can get real surprised by the price and "creativity" that might not match expectations)']
["Saw Conan O'Brien here over the holidays.  Enough said.  Oh yeah, and the food is good."]
["Sure, it's pricey, but it is worth every penny! The food, the drinks, the service, the location, the decor, absolutely everything here deserves five stars! The manager took care of us from the initial reservation all the way until we were walking out the door and the waitstaff and bartender were friendly and knowledgeable. \n\nIf you are looking for a hot spot for a special occasion, look no further, this is it!!!"]
["5-stars again, this time all for Tom, the bar manager, and his amazing mixology skills. I told Tom the other night that I was hooked on Campari this summer, and he concocted the most amazing cocktail I've had in some time. It started with him lighting a snifter on fire before pouring in the cocktail itself; need I say more? Once again, Craigie takes the cake."]
['Expensive but very good. What you see on the plate might not seem like a lot of food but it sure filled my tummy.  Atmosphere and wonderful cuisine has done the Groceria better than proud.  A very nice place to treat yourself. The wait staff were friendly and very helpful all around.']
['Outstanding. Casual atmosphere, but deadly serious about their food.']
['Went to this restaurant for brunch and was asked to wait on the ramp for a couple spots to open up at the bar because all the tables were reserved.  We waited for nearly an hour before finally getting two seats at the bar, and the bartender took forever with everything.  Waited for ages to get the check, and once we finally got the check and left a credit card, we finally decided life was passing us by and that we\'d just leave cash instead of waiting for her.  So, we spent two hours in that restaurant for a meal that was pretty good, but what really set me off were the empty tables that were "reserved" the entire time we were there.  The food wasn\'t worth it, nor was it worth the scowls on most of the staff\'s faces.']
["Oh my god this place is incredible--it brings a big city decadence to cozy little Cambridge.  The bar, the drinks, the food--all were superlative.  I spent years hearing about the Bistro but never made it.  I'm psyched that Craigie on Main is on my walk home from work, it's likely I'll spend 3-5 nights here at the bar.  I can't wait to try the Brunch!"]
["I'm only here to make a mention of the burger, 'cause I've been to the Bistro from its days up Craigie to its reincarnation on Main, several times and totally enjoyed all of 'em, but I hadn't had the opportunity to have the bar food, so, last night, with the usual suspects, I sat at the bar. Everything said about the cocktails is true. And the burger is fantastic. First, they ain't afraid to leave it alone and serve it rare. You have good beef, freshly ground, there ain't a problem, and beef is better still walking, IMHO. Good garnishes- just like something I'd make for myself at home, and I know what I'm doing with a hamburger. The place is very busy, very popular, and very good. Tony Maws, the chef extraordinaire, is a local treasure."]
['My girlfriend and I came for the "best burger in Boston" and was told that they only made 18 burgers a night and that we should have came earlier, around 6pm. This was met with the uncomfortable fact that we had arrived at 8:30pm and we literally saw someone get their burger 10 minutes after we were seated. I think it\'s somewhat misleading when you claim to have one of best burger in boston and you can\'t make more than 18. We figured we were already here and this place is rated 4 1/2 stars on Yelp, it must be worth ordering the regular fare here anyway. So instead of having the burgers we had the grilled octopus, 2x pork three ways, and the sorbet dessert. The grilled octopus was pretty decent except for the fact that we got SAND in almost every bite we had. You would think that a restaurant of this caliber would be able to clean their octopus out properly. The pork three ways was horribly unbalanced and way too salty with no acid to balance it out, especially the rib. The confit was extremely oily (yes, I know it\'s supposed to be stored in fat) and made both of us feel extremely greasy. The pork belly was not bad, but really nothing special and definitely was a very tiny slice for the amount we were paying. By the end of the dish the flavors were so greasy and overpowering that my girlfriend actually felt sick from it. I am not exaggerating. On a side note, we both LOVE pork and we practically eat pork every other meal we go out, so it\'s not a problem of not having love for pork. In the end, the we ordered sorbet and it was a huge relief from all that. Again, it was nothing to rave about and I have to emphasize that the pricing for very normal tasting sorbets at an "a la carte" value of $13 is kind of pushing it. This place is incredible overrated and overhyped. We came away feeling extremely disappointed and ripped off by the experience.']
["We made a reservation a week in advance.  We knew it was going to be expensive, but accepted the price point because of its reputation and awards.  Terribly disappointed.  We had a seat in the bar, fine, but the waiters kept banging into my husband's chair.  We were squished and uncomfortable.  Best part of the dinner was the mocktail, which the bartender surprised me.  Portions incredibly small, we had the terrine plate, which was good.  I had the chicken and my husband had the lamb three ways.  It serves me right for ordering chicken; moist but bland and flavorless.  The lamb was o.k., what there was of it, but not exciting or original.  Desserts not appetizing.  We went down the street for ice cream.  For $150 for two people, with no drinks, the food should be outstanding and it is NOT outstanding at Craigie Street."]
["Seriously, don't believe the burger hype. I heard that Craigie served the best burger in town, so I went there and had it. The burger was AWFUL. It was very SALTY and greasy (and overpriced. It was $18 + $3 extra for 3 mini slices of extra-salty bacon). I honestly think McDonald's beef burger tastes better than Craigie's."]
['We went to Craigie on Main early on a Wednesday evening and sat at the "Chef\'s Table." We were talked into the 6 course chef\'s tasting. My God! Thank you, waiter, for showing us the light! It was amazing and decadent and adventuresome and basically a total knock out. We recently had been to No 9 Park for a tasting menu treat.. in the end, C&amp;M may have won the battle for best tasting menu due to the more casual atmosphere and the rabbit sausage lasagne. meow.']
['Meh. Went to Craigie with high expectations which unfortunately were not met. The service was efficient, though not terribly warm. Unusually long  waits between ordering and receiving drinks and food, no amuse bouche, no apologies for delay, nothing. And then there were the flies. The colony of flies that hovered on the wall behind our table and which swattered around our food and drinks the entire evening were not something I would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. Worse, when we mentioned this to the waitress, the response was a dry "we are aware of the fly problem." The food was well prepared and tasty (desert in particular), though not anything memorable or beyond what I can get at many of the very good restaurants throughout Cambridge. All in all, a disappointing evening.']
["My sister is a big foodie and she took me here for my birthday.  What a treat! We both got the 6 course tasting menu. We were able to try a variety of food.  The service was great and we didn't feel rushed at all as we ate our way through the courses.  I would absolutely go back for a special occasion."]
['My boyfriend and I went here for our anniversary since it came highly recommended on yelp and personally. I also have to preface this in saying that my boyfriend is very allergic to dairy (not just lactose-intolerant, which most people don\'t understand) so going to any restaurant is an adventure.\nPros:\n-The food was delicious and the wine pairings great. My favorite dish by far was the goat cheese cheesecake. ( I got the 3-course tasting menu). \nThe cods cheeks were also excellent as an appetizer- very rich\nThe drinks were good, but kind of overpriced for a pretty typical cocktail.  \n-The service by the servers was great- very attentive and carefully listening.\nCons:\nThe atmosphere is a little lacking- it is quite loud and the kitchen is open so you can here the chefs talking- which meant we heard all of their snotty comments about the \'allergy table"\n- My food was lukewarm-cold when it came out, presumably because they had to cook my boyfriend\'s food separately from everything, but if I am paying over $200 for a meal, I want it to be perfect, so I found that pretty annoying. \nI rarely spend more than $20-25/person at a restaurant, so I wanted this to be special and it was, but not as good as I wanted it.']
["This place was amazing! I enjoyed myself from the moment we entered to the moment we left. Our waitstaff were perfect. Friendly, attentive, knowledgable, yet not over bearing. This is the mixture of ease and professionalism that every restaurant should strive for. \nThe food: The chef is  a person who loves food and understands flavors. I love that they offer proteins that are often overlooked but shouldn't be. \nI had the pig's tail to start and my only regret is that I didn't order two. Good doesn't do this plate justice. The peanut sauce, peppers and cilantro cut the richness of the fat perfectly. Sometimes a plate is perfect and this is one of them.\nWe were so happy to hear they had a special side that night, bone marrow. It was cooked beautifully and so plentiful.  \nFinally I had the veal two ways (sweetbreads and breast) and it was great too. I love sweetbreads. They were wonderful. The breast was nice but not fantastic. Still worthy to finish though!\nWe shared a piece of the bourbon pecan pie which isn't my thing(bourbon) but I could still appreciate how nicely it was made. My husband finished it and  even liked his coffee at the end. \nFour courses, coffee, wine and fantastic service for under $200. Totally worth every penny. I hope we head back there soon so I can try the pig's head for two. This is a place for people looking for an experience."]
["I desperately want to love this place.  I do.  I love pig ears, I love poached eggs, and I'm down with organic and local and Cambridge and yadda yadda yadda.  But I've been to Craige 7-8 times now, and its never lived up to the first time I went (when it was Criagie St. Bistro), and I'm tired of making excuses for Tony Maws and co.  They do serve some outstanding dishes, but it's just too expensive to serve mediocre food, and they serve lots of it.  \n\nBefore I get to the negatives, let me just say that we've had some great food at Craige.  We went once and had the 10 course chef's tasting menu, and the first course was this unbelievable 3 bites of seafood with oysters, octopus and squid salad.  Amazing.  Also had their goat cheese cheesecake for dessert which rocked my world, and a fried pig ear's salad that was rich and delightful.  So there's plenty to like, for sure, and I can remember plenty more great dishes.  \n\nBut there's just too many negatives to live up to its rep and its price.  Couple examples: we went once and had the roast chicken dinner for two.  That should be a softball a place like Craigie, but the chicken had this unappealing thyme jus and the potato side dish was not good (i think it was something like au gratin, how do you mess that up?).  Another: just went for brunch, and the scallops and grits was just too much fat and a strange combination of flavors.  A friend had the ham and cheese panini which was oddly gross.  It had this piquant flavor in the ham that left a very unappealing aftertaste in your mouth.  Finally: that 10 course chef's tasting menu - by course 5, we felt bloated and ready for bed.  Literally didn't eat the last 2 courses.  I mean I know 10 courses is decadent, but EVERY COURSE had loads of butter/duck fat/pigs ears/pulled pork/etc and its was just too much.  Trust me: I love all those things.  I'm the guy that has 5 lbs of duck fat in his freezer from the last 2 batches of turkey leg confit.  But 10 courses of that and even I feel like death.  It was just a poorly designed meal and for the price was not at all worth it.  \n\nSo go to Craigie if you must and order that amazing burger with bone marrow, or just have the pigs ear salad at the bar.  But be warned, and honestly, for less money, you have better options in Cambridge (Ten Tables or Bergamot come to mind)."]
['The more I think about it, the more I\'m a fan of this place. I\'m not used to "nice" restaurants, where the wait staff will go through the menu and explain each item, or where the person who brings out the food will repeat in detail exactly what you ordered, or where the waiter can rattle off a full description about a randomly chosen bottle of wine, so at first I was put off, but have come to appreciate the effort put forth. \n\nThe menu is $$$, so I opted for the "Neighborhood menu", which came with a watercrest salad (with delicious, thin onion rings on top), the duck confit, and a dessert of the chef\'s choosing (the peanut butter parfait). I don\'t usually go for duck (mostly because I never think of it), but this duck was tender, already off the bone, and the ingredients fully complimented each other. The parfait was good, and while the sour milk gel-like substance (can\'t remember the name) was yummy by itself, I didn\'t think it went all that well w/ the parfait. But, absolutely no complaints since I gobbled it up, the only regret being that it was gone.\n\nThe portion of the main dish was a bit smaller than I would have liked (I\'m a sucker for doggie bags), but I walked away from the restaurant fully satisfied and not overly full. Even after two bread baskets (which they offered to refill after the first was gone-- we didn\'t even have to ask!).\n\nMy friends and I sat in the bar area, which seems slightly more relaxed than the dining room. There were people in suits, but also people in jeans and sweaters. Older crowd (a nod to the pricing). Previous  critiques may have been put off by the "slow" service, but it\'s really just the type of service that comes with that type of restaurant-- a night out should be enjoyed, not rushed.']
['Went there last night.  We had a great view of the kitchen.  The next time, I want "ring side".  The staff are extremely knowledgeable, attentive and friendly.  Our server, Sara, was awesome!\nThe food was very good.  I had the tuna and the beef.  Some of the flavors challenged my pallette.  I felt some of the spices and marinades overpowered the natural flavors.  As far as temps and presentation, they were spot on.  My partner had the corn potage which was sooooo yummy.  He loved the chicken too and was especially impressed with the spices under the skin.\nI went to Craigie Bistro back in the day.  That was one of the best food experiences I\'ve ever had.  This one wasn\'t quite up there but I will definitely go back to On The Main and try again.  I\'ve heard the burger and potato are awesome!']
['We went at the end of a 2-week trip to DC, upstate NY and Boston that featured 10 high end restaurants. We went with Yelper recommendations and got the tasting menu with wine pairings. Great first two courses, pasta was not up to the rest of the meal. Dessert was also average. Great service, glad I went but this rated in the bottom quartile of place we dined.']
['I went with my cousin, a chef, for the 10 course tasting menu. It was fantastic! Each dish was beautiful. The flavors were subtle and delicate at times while powerful and forward at others. I loved the use of local, interesting ingredients. When we ordered the chefs menu our waiter cautioned us about the use of ofel yet nothing was too too challenging. My scallop was just slightly over cooked, but the scallop roe (still attached) was creamy and delicious. We had a wonderful Austrian Blaufrankisch that complemented the seafood, red and white meat. \n\nMy only reservation, and the only reason i did not give 5 stars, is that the menu did not follow a clear progression. Each dish complemented the previous dish, yet the unbridled "fusion" sometimes muddled what should have been a clearer path.  \n\nOverall, Cragie on Main is an excellent restaurant with outstanding food. The setting is beautiful; the open kitchen shows the craft behind each dish. The staff was friendly, helpful and efficient. The Chef personally greeted us during our tasting. This confirmed what we had both already seen in the meal: care, restraint, wonderful attention to detail and most importantly pride in his work.  I have spent twice as much on meals half as good. My complements to the Chef!']
['I literally just got back from there and had to write this review! Amazing brunch. Awesome organic pancakes and granola took care of my hangover. I even tried the grilled pork belly!Loved the atmosphere and the service as well. I dont know why i never came here before.  Will be back for sure.']
["I'm not saying every dish at Craigie totally hits the mark, but Tony Maws takes a thoughtful, meticulous approach to his craft as few others do. I commend these folks for their commitment to finding the best in local ingredients and displaying such a deft touch with them.\n\nI tend to be a nitpicker whenever it comes to my cooking or anyone else's, but this place always sends me home with one or two dishes I can't stop thinking about...the grilled octopus, the organic lamb or pork served 2 or 3 amazing ways, a little bone marrow...\n\nAll perspective is swallowed up by the thrill of finding these captivating dishes. I'll simply highly recommend it and move on.\n\n(Incidentally, a couple years ago Craigie cracked my list of The Greatest Meals I've Ever Had when it served me an amazing skate wing. They created a truly memorable experience.)"]
['Had my second birthday dinner of the week here. OMG! This was way more enjoyable than the fancy steak place. Our table ordered the 6 course tasting menu. Mainly because I decided that is what I wanted before we were told that the tasting menu had to be for the whole table or not at all. But it was definitely the way to go! It was so much fun to see what was going to be brought out to us next! My brother didn\'t even notice when the chef came out to great us and present the last dish to the table because he was so intent on the food itself.\nWe didn\'t try to make reservations until Monday for a Thursday night so we couldn\'t go until 8:30. The tasting menu was an event upon itself and we left a little after 11:30 very, very full. "6" courses was 6 savory courses plus a dessert. And then they threw an order of the brussel sprouts in for good measure because we had mentioned that they sounded good when ordering. Excellent food and excellent service. We are already trying to find an excuse to go back.']
["So far, this is the best American/western restaurant that I have tried in the greater Boston area.  I actually went to the old Craigie Bistro, but I am assuming that the one on Main is the same.  It's warm, inviting, fresh, creative.  I love to try new/interesting things on the menu so I was able to try cocks' combs, which was deliciously flavored and pared with other fresh ingredients.  The profiterole dessert was fairly good.  The service is superb.\n\nThe one set back of the old restaurant was that the seats were excruciatingly close to one another.  I was practically sitting on my random neighbor's lap."]
['man, oh man... can\'t i say i\'ve ever had many dining experiences better than this in boston...just a shout out to the impeccable local sourcing of the menu and true (not just lip service) to sustainable, small-scale farming, organic ingredients, and truly "green" philosophy\n\nthe pork three ways was phenomenal... best belly i\'ve ever had, well carmelized and oh, so tender... the rib perfectly tender and fall off the bone good... the worst of the three was the suckling confit, which was a tad dry, but still delicious... the scallops seared in chorizo oil were divine, and a nice break from the reliable but predictable butter/oil traditional method of preparation...the whole chicken for two was beautifully roasted and above-average, but not superlative.. price is a mark against the place, but i\'m willing to pay for the local sourcing, organic ingredients, and classically trained kitchen\n\nnow, if the review sounds great, but not sublime... three things pushed the meal into decidedly five-star territory (or beyond):\n\n(1) the rabbit sausage appetizer! - prepared two ways with perfectly poached eggs, expertly cooked mushrooms and edible flower garnish was just as beautiful as it was delicious... the dish came together on the fork and was inspiring\n\n(2) bone marrow side order with toast... enough said! truly a treat...\n\n(3) the open kitchen is a beautiful sight, and the service perfect, attentive, instructive, but not overly solicitous...']
["this is definitely a special occasion destination, the food is absolutely delicious like nothing you've experienced before, if you are a true foodie you should not miss this place, sure you will run up a tab but keep in mind you're not going to come here every week but if you're out looking for a unique and wonderful food experience don't miss this place, kudos to Tony and his staff they do make dining special"]
["The menu is, well, unusual... Definitely not your usual fare. I like that. When l dined here last night I had the tilefish, which was very nice. Just the right texture, and the clams and broth turned out to complement the fish very well. The refresher between main course and dessert, a small bowl of cranberry sorbet, was fantastic. Why didn't I give it a better rating?  The dessert that was recommended by my waitress (apple and almond cake) was quite one-dimensional in taste --- not sure I would have recognized the main ingredients of that cake if I hadn't known what it was. Not bad at all -- if I had bought it at a grocery store. While I enjoyed the food, there are better places in town in that (upper) price range. I also didn't like the ambiance. Okay for a business dinner, ideally with a group of people, but given the noise level, definitely not the place for a dinner that includes a conversation. The low point of the evening was the check. The $30 main course had morphed into a $75 prix fixe. The waitress immediately corrected the error when I pointed it out but this simply shouldn't happen."]
['Yes! I knew I was holding out a 5 star rating for a reason. This place is without a doubt a true 5 star worthy restaurant. Probably the best restaurant I have ever been to. It is that good. Simply amazing.']
["Man alive, this place was amazing. If you've got a chunk of change to throw  around definitely get the tasting menu! Pricey but worth it. There were  internal organs involved, but you know what? They were good, damn good. The only draw back for me was they didn't have wine parings with the tasting menu but the chef made some great recommendations so problem solved."]
["We loved the old Craigie. Great food. Intimate dining. The new Craigie on Main is disappointing. Busy atmosphere from too many wait-staff, almost feels like you are in a cooking school. Food, although tasty, was over-salted. Felt bloated the next morning. Fois Gras appetizer bread was too crispy and shredded the top of my mouth. Waiter gracefully asked for any issues with any dishes and without our asking, the restaurant host gave us a gift certificate for a free appetizer at another time. Tempted to go back just for the Spanish Octopus which is wonderful, but probably won't."]
["DO NOT COME HUNGRY. I agree with Dr. C- very overrated restaurant experience overall. Do not come hungry and expect to pay twice as much for any app and entree. The waitress admitted the entree my friend ordered (vegetable  plate dinner) is meant to be part of a 3 course meal and therefore may not be filling alone. So we ordered an app- the octopus was very delicious, however it was two small pieces that is not enough to be shared (and the price of a regular entree anywhere else). We also ordered the clams app- that was amazing, however again 5 small clams for $18. Entrees were very small portions, but flavorful. Another friend said the Craigie burger was the best burger in Boston. Overall the services was average. The waitress somehow makes a side dish of Bone Morrow sound like something everyone in the world should order (and everyone should know what that even is??). I personally just have a hard time enjoying wonderful food when you pay twice as much for 1/3 the typical portion size when dining out (and I'm not a fatty). The 6 and 10 course tasting option sounded tempting however they did not list a price and I didn't even want to ask after looking at the price of everything else.\nI'm  not cheap at all- but I have a hard time paying for a dining experience that leaves me hungry and wanting something else. I'm glad I asked for a 2nd helping of the complimentary bread!"]
["Excellent Sunday brunch - a great restaurant with *none* of the attitude. We had really great bagels, steak and eggs and the corned beef hash. Craige's take on each was very unique and well worth trying. Very strong focus on local ingredients, right amounts of flavours (some may surprise you), and very friendly staff. A welcome addition to the neighborhood!"]
["I've been here once for dinner and twice for brunch.  For dinner we had the tasting menu which was a ton of fun.  The food was great and the courses presented interesting takes on their ingredients.  They had lamb sweet breads as well as scallops that had more than just the one typical muscle included.  Before the last major course the chef came out and talked to us, which was also fun.  I love the open kitchen atmosphere and you can tell that the head chef puts a lot of personal attention into the restaurant.  For brunch we've always just walked in and eaten at the bar.  Everything we've had there has ranged from good to great.  I'd recommend the corn beef hash and the potato galette."]
['completely wonderful in every way. the drinks alone are a step above all others, and the food... no words can describe! marry me, craigie on main!']
["I signed up on Yelp just because I felt that I needed to give Craigie a shout out! I love fine dining and Boston, sad to say has a few fine dining restaurants but not as many as I would like to see in a metropolitan city. Craigie on Main was such a surprise! I work in Central Square and I must have passed this place about 50 times and never knew how great this place was! The food and service here are what fine dining establishments should look up to. I went with my Girlfriend Julie R and we had a great experience! I had the pre fixe country menu that featured a first course of pate with cornichons and diced onion, a second course of Duck Confit over unbelievable potatoes (I have no idea how they cooked them but they made potatoes taste like nothing I have ever tasted before) and a third course of warm fruit cobbler with vanilla ice cream, all courses were out of this world! Julie got the White Salmon entrée and the fish was cooked perfectly. Julie's portion of salmon for 33.00 was like the size of a deck of cards but was fabulous! The portion was the only thing that was a bit disappointing. Julie wrote a short email to the owner about this concern and he graciously returned her email with a gift certificate to come back in. We were not expecting anything but this is what I mean when I say he was a consummate professional. I will definitely be back to Craigie!!"]
['Given their list of awards, we expected Craigie to be a great dining experience and  selected it, on that basis, for a special occasion.  Bad decision!  Service gets an A, ambiance a B.  Wine gets a C for being overpriced by up to 50%...and this is Cambridge, not Boston!! Unfortunately, the remainder of the meal gets an F.  Our first course was leek soup with sweetbreads...why was it green, and why were the sweetbreads the only flavor element? Our main courses were chicken breast and Vermont pork.  The chicken was nondescript and the pork was an odd assortment of fatty, supermarket quality meat that one might have expected as leftovers.  Sadly, the desserts more closely resembled concoctions put together by someone with artistic talent but no sense of taste in terms of complimentary flavors. The bottle of filtered water was a nice touch but given that it was served at room temperature, an offer of ice would have been a nicer touch.  Perhaps, as some of the reviews indicate, this is a place for burgers rather than dinner.  Attractive plates filled with unusual blends of ingredients applied to run of the mill cuts of meat does not equal gourmet, though the descriptions do qualify as pretentious.  I doubt that Julia would have liked the food, it is not equal to what is served in Paris (or Quebec, Montreal, London, NYC, SF,etc.) as anyone who travels can attest to.  We would have been dissatisfied with this meal at any price, but $230 simply added insult to injury.']
['Amazing!!  My favorite restaurant experience ever!!!  I had the 6 course tasting menu and it was a wonderful experience.  I just told them what type of things I liked and disliked and then they surprised me with each course. It was so much fun!!  And and fyi they are even vegan friendly which is great!!  So go and enjoy it is definitely a foodie place.']
['It is hard to not like a labor of love but I did not enjoy my dining experience last Saturday evening. My husband and I shared the polenta (tasteless), crispy potato galette (too greasy and slightly burnt) and crispy fried pigs\' tails.  We did not expect the tails to have bone chips and we were lucky we did not break a tooth. Without asking the waiter took the charge of  the tails off the bill. We did not complain but I guess my facial expression and the comment "interesting" when asked how I like the pigs\' tails gave it away. It is with regrets that I share my disappointment.']
['This is my favorite restaurant in Boston. The food is consistently great, desserts are yummy and the drinks are also well mixed. Finally, the staff is always very pleasant. Another big draw for  me is that its not as pretentious as the other French restaurants around so you feel comfortable asking the wrong Qs :)']
['Best. Burger. Ever. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because the atmosphere was a tad too stuffy for me. They pride themselves on great service and you definitely get that, but sometimes a too attentive staff can be a turn-off for me. I felt a little weird ordering the burger, but I had read such good reviews about their burger that I just had to try it. It literally melted in my mouth. I do wish it came with better fries (other than "shoe string fries") - how about sweet potato fries, no??? We ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer that was delicious - LOVE the spicy asian sauce layered underneath the sliced avocado. I was pleasantly surprised by the portion for the sashimi appetizer, then again it was approx $17 so maybe it was about right. Although pricey, the food is well worth the money. Even the bread basket was fantastic!']
['This past weekend my hubby and I finally made it to Craigie on Main along with another couple. Let let me tell you, things may never be the same. My hubby has even gone so far as to declare his meal at Craigie *possibly* better than his beloved L\'Espalier.\n\nFor starter\'s the craft cocktails are amazing. I have been gushing about the "classic" cocktail for many a post lately, and I still think it\'s fantastic. The bartender, sorry ... mixologist, was like a mind reader. I told our waiter Jonathan (who by the way was really great at explaining everything to us) what I liked and didn\'t like, he conveyed it to the mixologist and the result was the perfectly crafted cocktail, just to my liking. Order off the menu if you like ... or be whimsical and let the craftsmen (or women) perfect their trade. Trust me, you won\'t be disappointed. I will also add a plug for the mocktails with amazing ingredients such as homemade almond syrup, rhubarb juice, ginger beer, bitters - the list goes on and on. \n\nCocktails in hand, the four of us began perusing the menu. With SO many appealing options, how were we to choose? Well it was easy, we didn\'t. We let the Chef choose for us. We all opted for the 6 course tasting menu for $80 bucks a pop. Not cheap, but heck, we\'re here for a culinary experience right?\n\nThis is where I let the menu and the pictures do (most of) the talking (see pic of full printed menu and pictures in blog). They kinda speak for themselves. There is NO possible way I could have remembered all of the courses and the unique ingredients that comprised them. No possible way. Luckily, I didn\'t have to as Jonathan graciously offered to have the hostess prepare a personal printed menu of the chef\'s selections for each of us to take home. And you\'d think, that\'s easy, right? That the hostess can simply print out the pre-set chef\'s tasting course of the night? Nope. Each and every table gets a different make up of courses, so the menu was totally personalized for our table. Honestly, where can you find such personalized service?\n\nOh and before I forget - many of the ingredients are local-yocal. Chef/Owner Tony Maws finds the ingredients first, surveying local farmers and purveyors, each and every day, and then creates the menu. Literally, the menu changes daily. In fact, the last page of the clipboard menu lists all of the local food suppliers that were used in preparing the day\'s menu. Really freakin\' awesome.\n\nSo the first four courses consisted of seafood. Tony uses uncommon or rare ingredients such as caviar, geoduck, squid noodles, etc. Of these delicious dishes, my favorite was easily the sashimi dish, but truly, everything was phenomenal. Though, the geoduck got a few skeptical glances at first.\n\nNow onto the meat. These were the hits of the evening for me, a true carnivore at heart. The Vermont (local!) meats, both the organic braised lamb and the pork were absolutely out of this world. The lamb meat was so tender it was falling off the bone (as it should be). And the crunch of the shallots and zing of the ginger provided just the right compliment. Fantastic, it shouldn\'t get any better ... but it did. When I was first looking at the menu, I had my eye on the "Pork Two Ways" dish. In fact, if there was any disappointment with choosing the tasting menu at all, it was because I wasn\'t going to get to try this dish. Well, low and behold, to my surprise, it was one of the courses. Yippee! And it was the favorite of the night, for me. The suckling confit had just the right amount of crispness to the skin to set off the soft tender meat below. And the pork belly? Just enough fat to meat proportion to make it one of the most delicious things ever. Not to mention the mushrooms and perfectly cooked cashews on the side.\n\nSo that should be it, right? The 6 courses above ... well Tony is so into the creativity of the Chef\'s menu that he doesn\'t really stick to the numbers, he just keeps cooking away. Instead of 6, we ended up with a full 9 courses, rounding out the evening with 3 dessert courses. Everyone got the first selection which was the panna cotta, but there were two different types. A jasmine infused and a rooibos infused. Two of us got the jasmine and two of us got the rooibos. The rooibos was my personal favorite, the smooth creamy panna cotta, with a hint of the rooibos and citrus kick. Then, for the second round of dessert, instead of each of us getting the same exact thing, we were each brought a different treat. Needless to say, there was a lot of dish passing going around. My favorite was the chocolate terrine, but I have a feeling the overall winner was the market fruit crisp with the champagne mangoes. The miss, there be, would have to be the grits. I don\'t think any of us were too into the grits. Too savory for us, but if that\'s what you\'re into, you might enjoy it. The final selection was a small cup chile and cardamom hot chocolate. Need I say more?']
['i\'m not sure that i\'ve ever bore witness to a large, bustling open kitchen prior to setting foot in craigie on main. shouts of "service please! all runners!" offer color and character to the front of the restaurant as soon you state that you\'re a party of XX and have a reservation at XX. while this loud environment may not be for some, the experience of observing a busy staff, as well as the diners clad in tweed and business wear staring straight into the kitchen (or completely trying to ignore it) make for an incredibly interesting, and unique dining experience. \ni had very high hopes for craigie on main after reading shining review after shining review. and i think that for the most part that expectation was fulfilled, except perhaps with a little sour feeling that this may be a little too overpriced for what it is. all this being said, my bigger half and i had saved up to order craigie\'s 10 course tasting menu:\n\namuse bouche: inevitably the amuse is my favorite part of any meal, and craigie\'s proved no different . this was a trio of seafood. 1. tiny slices of sweet, and perhaps slightly beaten geoduct clam with an orange coulis sauce. 2. a white square of florida shrimp, topped with a miniature salad of grapefruit and greens- very clever. 3. the most surprising and delicious- house cured greek sardine with a little balsamic. salty, strong, and an item you\'re not likely to find elsewhere in the boston area. \n\nhiramasa sashimi with a pine nut salsa and puree, minuscule cubes of yellow beet and mango, and a dollop of white fish roe. second course and feeling fine, tony maws seemed to exercise a muscle from his clio past. an excellent piece of sashimi was presented with a complex topping: an unlikely combination of mango, beets, and pine nuts. \n\ndueling skewers of diver scallops and their roe- having never eaten diver scallop roe before, i am not dumbfounded at how anyone could ever throw out this part of the shellfish. chewy, tender, and a great eye opener, not to mention the perfectly cooked scallops themselves. this dish was presented on a lightly spiced yuzu sauce, and bits of pineapple. \n\nseared american snapper- charred snapper was not my favorite, but may appeal to those who appreciate barbecued fish with that lovely smokey flavor. this piece of fish was served on a tahini sauce, and a splash of bitter lemon, adding a very refreshing taste to this fish course.\ngod bless the beginnings of veggie season! - reminiscent of a spring garden, perfectly cooked asparagus, radishes, celery were presented with micro greens and a sweet pea coulis, and topped with a soft boiled egg and a scattering of snails. after all, what spring garden is complete without a few tender snails:) ps. cracklins to add a salt note. \nbraised lamb belly- the one truly low point of the meal (disclaimer: it is possible that i do not like braised meats as they are often not my favorite course). a large piece of lamb belly was presented on top of some of its resulting juices. frankly, this was very very salty, and i had been slightly surprised that more of the fat had not been rendered off. i was unable to finish this course.\na trio of duck - a nice end to the savory portion of the meal, chef tony presented this course himself. 1. duck neck (I think... i had been too shy to ask the chef to repeat his description) had been stuffed with foie gras. 2. a slice of breast, smoked in tea was served over sauteed spinach. 3. a cake of duck confit presented as a third bite. very enjoyable, nicely salted, and tenderly cooked on all three portions.\n~~~~\ndesserts: \na duo of panna cottas: rooibos and jasmine flavored. honestly i hogged the rooibos flavored serving. i\'m not sure if you can picture a jiggly bit of panna cotta that tastes exactly of the smell of south african rooibos, but i feel like i need a bucket of this to get me to a happy place at the end of a bad day. tony? buddy? \nchocolate mousse (for me) and sweet corn grits for the bigger half - both were excellent. in retribution for the rooibos panna cotta incident, the bigger half polished off most of both. \nthe big surprise? ancho chile and cardamon spiced hot coco. just a little cup full of some of the richest hot chocolate you\'ll be able to savor in a lifetime. fantastic.\n\noverall? an interesting place to observe, and a very busy restaurant. i recommend going a little on the earlier side to avoid some timing chaos if you\'re planning on ordering the chef\'s menu. this restaurant is absolutely a fantastic addition to a neighborhood of great restaurants in cambridge. generally excellent food, despite a couple low points, and unfortunately a bit overpriced, as in personally a trip to craigie for the tasting menu is not something i\'ll be able to afford on a regular basis. in the words of my husband, however, "i just wanna like...sit at the bar...and order a bunch of terrines." sounds like a plan to me, guy.']
['Very interesting and all natural and fresh ingredients go into the varied menu at Craigie On Main.  The bread was outstanding, the entrees had amazing flavors and the service was beyond compare (thanks Jonathan).  I highly recommend Craigies On Main for that special night out or anytime you find yourself in the Cambridge area.']
["My sisters and I went for cocktails - the absolute best in Boston, even though it's Cambridge. I had the chef's whim of four mini cocktails, and they were all delicious and completely different from anything I've had anywhere else. The bartender, John, was knowledgable and incredibly skillful, mixing magic potions with eyedroppers and shaking till his arms fell off. Absolutely worth the trip."]
["Our dinner was quite good, the food preparation was excellent and the culinary artistry was evident in all aspects of the meal.  It is a complex and unconventional menu that has exhaustive wine pairing possibilities - requiring really good waitstaff if it is all to come together well.  Our service was reasonably prompt, but we were serviced by a somewhat humorless troupe of waiters in their 20's who gave the appearance of being college graduates who had not yet launched their professional lives rather than professional waiters who loved their jobs.  It seems a minor point, until you realize that a couple of orders for the tasting menu and a good bottle of Pinot might run you half way to a four figure bill, and your being guided by a smug and somewhat bitter classics major who, while they can pass the test when describing ingredients and preparation details,  has little feel for the nuance of Tony Maws approach to food, and even less of a feel for the accomplishment of having succeeded in delivering a unique experience."]
["I took my girlfriend there for her birthday.  The menu is pretty eclectic and pricey.  Don't get me wrong, the quality is great, but the quantity is pretty light.  The choice between a price fixe and a la carte  to save 3 dollars on a 3 course meal is pretty absurd.  You really need to have 3 courses or you'll starve.  I had the mixed green salad with pigs ear garnish for 18 dollars.  It was yum but not too happy paying 18 dollars for less than 2 dollars worth of lettuce...The steak was very flavorful but needed a side of potatos or starch to accompany it.  My girlfriend raved about the octopus appetizer, but i thought it looked a little scary.  She thought the sea bass was just average for its priciness.  The desserts (mainly of fruit and cheese type dishes) were too eclectic for my taste.  This is a great restaurant for foodies.  I would go back, but only to try their burger that i've heard lots about...The service is great, which is hard to find in boston...."]
["I came here for just one burger and left burger, two drinks and a dessert later.  The restaurant is spectacular- starting with the wait staff, to the decor and most important the food.  Our waiter was super knowledgeable about the food and drink menu and helped out in picking 2 really good cocktails.  The hamburger was out of this world amazing!  It's tender, melt in your mouth beef that you will be dreaming about for the next few days.  The dessert was good too, but the burger is where it's at!  It's pricey, but worth every penny."]
["I've heard about this place from multiple people, and finally my two friends took me there. There are two sections of the restaurant - the  more formal one and the bar area. We ate at the bar and the food was absolutely to die for! I've tried octopus more times than I can count, but this was definitely the best I ever had. For dessert we had a sheep's milk cheesecake with a pine nut crust, which was so delicious. All the staff is extremely friendly without exception. Their friendliness and the warm atmosphere of the place makes you want to come back there time and again."]
['In an attempt to expand our culinary palettes beyond potato skins and pizza (to be fair, it\'s the wallet not the palette that needs expanding), my boyfriend and I are on a plan to try one new "best burger in Boston" each month, and Craigie was our first stop on the list last month.  To get right to the point, the burger did not disappoint - juicy and perfectly cooked (does ANY place understand "medium" anymore??), with a side of wonderfully salty potato sticks.  VERY satisfying.  We weren\'t as moved by the sides we got (marrow, brussels sprouts), but the atmosphere was good, the service was impeccable, and the crowning glory on the night was the delicious Pretty Things Jack D\'Or on tap.  An amazing beer.  Immediately the bf wrote his manager about getting it on tap at their bar, where it has also been a hit.  Great beer, and from a local (Cambridge) brewery - what a treat!  Once we have hit up the other "best burger" places in Boston (Radius, Toro, Flat Patties), I vote we return to Craigie asap.']
['food was good but nothing to rave about... have been there 3 times but everytime I feel like there is always something missing.']
["very nice experience at Craigie on Main. don't usually go to high end restaurants b/c i prefer a more casual dining atmosphere but i must say the atmosphere was not stuffy and there was a good mix of people dressing casually as well as elegantly. the ambience was very warm and nice even if it was very busy the night i went.\nthe appetizers were wonderful. the sashimi was very nice. i learned that i'm not a big fan of ragout but that's ok. i was very impressed with everyone at the restaurant especially Ted the bartender for that night. very professional, very creative, provided personalized attention to everyone at the bar and knew exactly what drink would suit my nonalcoholic taste. it was very obvious that he was very good at his job. if you go, reserve early for a table."]
["we went on opening night with no reservation and actually scored quite a nice little table in the bar area.  the place was buzzing yet the staff seemed as enthusiastic, calm, and professional as i remember from craigie st. bistrot.  the drinks were great and the food, though it took a very long time to arrive, was wonderful.  i suspect if i go back, this time with a reservation, on a night other than opening night, i will likely have an even better experience.  i think they've done wonders with the old la groceria location.  i will miss the old quirky craigie, though..."]
['After several unsuccessful attempts to get reservations at four other restaurants we decided to drive to Craigie\'s and take our chances.  We arrived too late for the dinner menu but were pleasantly surprised with the bar menu which has plenty of interesting and delightful options. The ambience, décor, is outstanding and I love how the kitchen is part of the dining room; the state of the art cooking station was made in France. This was my third visit and I was surprised to see the place half empty; I\'ve never been able to get a seat at the bar.  The staff has always been very knowledgeable about the food and drink menus and tonight was no different.  We were sat as soon as the staff cleaned and set our table; within minutes our server greeted us and asked if we would like bottled or tap water.  I checked out the extensive wine list, most bottles are in the $45-$100 range with a few in the thirties.  This was my second time ordering 2005 Faugères \'Vieilles Vignes Château d la Liquière from the Languedoc region at $34.00 and we\'ve been extremely pleased with the quality and consistency.  It\'s a darker, heavier blend of grenache, carignan, syrah, cinsault and others; there are some bold tannins, probably oak-derived, with a smooth vanilla finish. \n I was happy to hear our waiter offer the roasted bone marrow to the table behind us (it\'s not on the bar menu), I\'ve been eager to try this resurrected dish for a while.  The sour dough bread (which happens to be my favorite) had a beautiful hard crust; soft on the inside with large air pockets and the perfect balance of sourness.  We started out with the Dodge Cove Oysters on the Half Shell with candied lemon mignonette; fresh, plump, and succulent; the lemon mignonette complimented the oyster\'s butter texture.  Next up were Maine Mussels with toasted garlic, chile caribe, miso, and herbs; my first reaction was holy $%&amp;* these are the largest, meatiest, mussels, I have ever seen.  They were served with plenty of toasted sour dough for dipping in the jus.\n  It would be impossible for me to visit Craigie\'s without sampling the Terrines, Assiette of House-Made Charcuterie: Duck Rillettes, Pate de Campagne, Foie Gras au Torchon; with a home made mustard, some type of blackberry sauce, and again plenty of toasted sour dough.  The texture was fine, smooth, not a country style; well seasoned and perfectly executed.  As we were enjoying these our server brought over the Crispy-Fried Pigs\' Tails with pickled peanuts, nuoc cham, cilantro; a little too greasy for my wife but well worth the effort if you don\'t mind using your hands and getting a little dirty.  She thought the cartilage was fat; it does look similar.  Crispy Fried Nova Scotia Smelts pickled peppers, preserved lemon, dried black olives, squid ink anchoiade; these were large and de-boned which made it easier for us.  I do prefer the smaller ones with the bones intact, you can eat the bones and heads; these are one of my father\'s favorite foods.  Perfectly seasoned but could have been a bit crispier and slightly less greasy in my opinion.  \n  I guess our main course would be the Local Grass-Fed Beef Burger and a pricy $18.00.  The burger was pretty huge at least 8-10 oz with Shelburne Farm cheddar, house made red wine pickle, celery root slaw and mace ketchup, house made sesame seed bun and crispy shoestring potatoes.  It was ordered medium rare, but it came out slightly undercooked and rare (which was acceptable), we enjoyed the burger; it is easily big enough for two.  The texture was smooth and moist, but I\'m not sure if it beats Fuddruckers, I might have to do a side by side taste test.  The shoestring fries reminded me of some chips that I would eat out of the can as a child, I\'m still not sure if I prefer them with the shoestring cut.  The service throughout all of the courses was timely, not overbearing or annoying, the server topped off my wine and water when it was low and answered all of our questions; he gave his opinions on beverages and dishes when asked by my wife.  \n  Last but not least was the Peanut Butter Parfait house-made hobnob cookie, cocoa nibs, banana foam.  I guess the banana foam could be considered molecular gastronomy; but to us it just tasted great and made sense.  Store.gourmetsleuth.com describes cocoa nibs as "simply roasted cocoa beans separated from their husks and broken in to small bits. The nibs are a new chef favorite and can be used in place of nuts atop ice cream or in cookies and even as a snack"\n  Was everything 100% perfect?  No, but it\'s about as close as one can get; definitely a solid "A".  My wife didn\'t finish her Hot Buttered Rum Cider with Fragrant and Lush\nAppleton Estate, canella, orange, and clove; she found it too buttery.  She didn\'t complain about it, but our attentive waiter noticed and told us he had them comp the cocktail.  I thought that was a nice touch to a perfect evening.']
["Most overrated underwhelming place I have been to in a LONG time.  This was the same for the couple seated next to us last Saturday night.  The only thing they had going for them was the service was good.  The food was sooo limited and what we did order wasn't that good at all.  I ordered Soup, which was good, an appetizer - grilled octopus (I think) is was not good after the second bite.  Just not cooked well.  Sashimi, not good either.  Scallop entree, decent at best.  I would NEVER go there again.  I almost had friends meet us there and I am VERY glad I didn't because I would have been embarrassed by suggesting it."]
["Not much to add to all the other reviews.  Fans of Craigie Street Bistro, now fans of Craigie on Main.  Went here for New Year's -- most expensive meal of my life, and totally 100% worth it."]
["I LOVED Craigie on Main- so much that I had to provide my first ever review!!!  We went to Craigie on St. Pat's Day for my bday and had a great time.  We sat at the Chef's table/bar which was fun and had an incredibly helpful waiter.  When my husband and I arrived we sat down and had no clue what to order since the menu was so unique.  Our waiter was phenonmenal at providing recommendations starting with cocktails.  We gave a few of our favorite drink types and he gave some killer recommendations - and the drink I had became my new favorite drink.  We then proceeded to order dinner and completely (thankfully) ventured outside our comfort zone with the guided hand of our waiter and tried cod cheecks, bone marrow, sweetbreads, and all kinds of amazing food.  We also had bass, amazing dessert, and fun appetizers.  Overall, a GREAT experience and I cannot wait to go back.   I already know that I have to try the burger that I kept seeing pass by which prokoved constant mouth-watering as well as go back to try the chef tasting menu.  Highly recommend!\nMake sure you get reservations!"]
['My family and I tried Craigie on Main on a recent trip to Boston and were impressed. Sat in the bar, which is quite comfortable, and liked the roast chicken, the mi-cuit arctic char and the pork. In our case, we were seated on time, and service was friendly.']
["I've been here twice; once for the Sunday chef's whim and once ordering a la carte. Everything from soup to salad to fish to meat was fantastic. Waitstaff is friendly and very knowledgeablel; great atmosphere."]
["Been here twice. One of my favorite restaurants in Boston area. First time, did a proper meal with apps, entre, dessert, and wine. Favorites are the burger, bone marrow, and pork. Second time sat at the bar and ordered a bunch of appetizers with cocktails. Love the octopus, cod cheeks, and seafood sausage. The bartenders are experts at mixing various cocktails and really know their stuff; ask them to recommend and mix up something off the cocktail menu. Craigie's is definitley one of those restaurants that my tongue salivates when I just hear the name spoken out loud."]
["Last night I went to Craigie on Main for Chef's Whim. It was my birthday. I hadn't been feeling well all day, but I was really looking forward to dinner. By 930pm it seemed like I was on the mend. \n\nWhen we were seated at the table, there was a card from Craigie wishing me a Happy Birthday. Our waiter and hostess knew everything about us based on casual questions my husband had asked or mentioned on the phone. Both wished me a happy birthday upon arrival, and our waiter let us know that he knew my husband was a pescetarian and he would talk to the chefs to accommodate. They did, gladly. Again, neither my birthday or my husband's diet were big points when making the reservation. They just paid attention. \n\nI've worked in restaurants before, so service is something that often disappoints me when going out to eat. I have never felt so welcomed and taken care as I did last night. \n\nWhen our first course arrived I felt instantly revitalized and felt like I was definitely feeling better. 2nd course I still felt ok. Right before the 3rd course I was feeling faint and began shaking. I was picking at this delicious plate of monkfish with yuzu, ginger, and chickpeas and was worrying if I was going to be sick. What to do? I couldn't finish. My husband called over the waiter to let him know that I'd suddenly had a turn for the worse. He was concerned, stopped the courses and brought the hostess over. They just wanted me to be happy, they would do whatever we wanted. Continue with the remaining three courses, trim it down to 4, or we could possibly even come back the following Sunday. I knew that if they brought out the 4th course, I would not be able to eat it, but I really didn't want to leave when we had been treated so wonderfully. Unfortunately, I had to admit that I could not go on. \n\nThey re-booked us for this Sunday, they only charged us for our drinks, and continually made us feel that they just wanted the best for us. I was nearly moved to tears.\n\nThis was the type of service that I dream about. Kind, knowledgeable, unobtrusive, elegant but welcoming, and with obvious love for food and the experience of dining. Without question the best dining experience I have ever had. I cannot wait to finish my 6 courses this Sunday and I would recommend Craigie to anyone and everyone."]
['craigie would have received a higher rating if it wasn\'t for the fact that it took me 25 minutes from the time i walked in the door from a full time job and a part time class at school to get a sip of wine.  what was ironic was that there were probably three times as much waitstaff employed than at any other restaurant establishment, even in this economic downturn, and the hierarchy was apparent.  i had walked in and gave the two hosts at the door my name and that i was part of a party for two with an 8.00pm reservation.  i had actually arrived early at 7.40pm.  the host proceeded to check in my coat and my bag, and reported that i was the first to arrive [obviously, being this early] and that i am welcome at the bar.  first, i walked to the wrong bar -- at the open kitchen.  silly me.  the host had to apologetically tell me that the bar was at the other side of the restaurant. no worries.  i walk over, and took a seat at the end of the bar next to some guy with a pile of bones in front of him.  he was chatting about how good the bone marrow was and that he would like to pack them up to take home to his dogs.  the bartender he was chatting to saw me sit down and peruse the bar and dinner menus already laid out in front of me.  i asked the bartender for a drink menu, which he promptly produced.  i requested a recommendation, but by then, the bartender was making another drink.  he said that he would be right with me, but then he disappeared.  probably five minutes later, some other guy with a marron shirt, black vest and glasses showed up, and recommended a bottle.  i quickly and decisively said, "i will try that."  ten minutes later, nothing.  by then, my date had arrived, and we left the bar to get seated.  i requested for them to transfer the bottle of wine to our table, whenever they remembered.  \n\nwhen we approached the hosts to get seated [by then, there were three of them], they explained that our table was being set.  five minutes more of us waiting by the door with the heavy traffic speeding by us.  we were finally presented with a four-person table adjacent to the door and by the open kitchen with high bar stools.  we looked longingly at the normal tables, where people could sit closely together.  we sat down across from each other, until i finally got exasperated, and changed seats so that i can be next to my boyfriend.  that, and the fact that the wine finally arrived, made me much happier.  \n\nwhen we sat down, we were blessed with a very sweet server.  i had asked her if she was aware that the bottle of wine i had ordered was being transferred to the table, and she assured me that "it\'s right there, looking at you!"  she sensed it was what i needed, immediately.  after the wine, a hearty but slightly fruity bordeaux [they have a good wine selection, with few sweet fruity wines], we ordered the assiette of three terrines and the greek sardines.  the pate plate was great, my favorite being the liver pate, but the greek sardines were superb.  i had no idea that the oiliness of the fish could complement the mild sweetness of beets so well.  \n\nwe elected to skip the tasting menu to just order entrees.  my boyfriend\'s tasmanian sea trout was described as, and eventually looked, a lot like salmon with the pink color, but was less meaty and lighter in flavor.  the meat flecked off perfectly with the touch of a fork.  i had elected to go with the pork done two ways:  crispy and pork belly.  delicious but so rich, i had to pack it up and save it for lunch tomorrow.  our server threw in more of the yummy iggy\'s french bread for me.  we still had our traditional dessert despite being rather full -- they split the one glass of laphroig scotch in to separate glasses.  \n\nthe atmosphere was not what i expected.  i suppose it should be what i expected, since it is essentially a french bistro.  the open kitchen, with tony maws presiding [he\'s the one without the hat] conveyed a sense of bustling activity, rather than the more sophistocated, serene atmosphere i had envisioned.  i would go back again, knowing that it had a more casual atmosphere, and sit at the bar instead next to my boyfriend, where we can sample the equally interesting bar menu.']
['Read the reviews and expected a great meal....but what I had was an "out of this world "meal.  Got lucky and was able to book a table for the same evening and it kept getting better from there.  Seated promptly with view of the kitchen.  As an amateur wanna-be chef, watching the kitchen at work was a treat.  The Chef was on top of every plate leaving the kitchen.  The colors, presentation, and taste of everything from the selections of terrines and pates to the mushroom ragout were stunning.  My partner and I each had the Pork Three Ways and I am now a devotee of the porcine world.  The waiter helped me select a wine and it was perfect (and reasonable).  I\'ve lived in Europe and Asia and have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world....and Craigies has now joined my list.  Loved it.']
['burger! donut! burger! donut! any place where the small board indicating which foods to "86" includes donuts and burgers and profiteroles is ok with me.  everything i\'ve eaten here has been amazing.  even the coffee is amazing (made my friend say OMG).  bet on the meat if you cant decide what to order.  if you want the burger, get a brunch reservation and then you can get a donut too.  i might be a little obsessed with this donut...']
["This is the second time I've been to Craigie since it moved from the Harvard Sq area.  I (and four of my friends) specifically went there on a fact-finding mission to try their burgers, which we were fascinated by after reading a blog post that describes how they're made (the blog post was linked from Serious Eats' 'A Hamburger Today' blog when I read it).  \n\nI have to say that the burger is pretty awesome - second maybe to the burger I had at Upstairs on the Square, but I'd have to try the Upstairs burger again to really be sure...  Back to Craigie - the burger lives up to its name: it's not too greasy (Four Burgers), perfectly cooked, and really wonderfully flavorful.  My palate is not quite sophisticated enough to taste the sumac ketchup in the presence of the beef and onions flavors, but possibly the burger could have done a bit better with a little acidity in the ketchup.  It's also quite hefty: I didn't eat anything after that until the next afternoon!  We also had some pigs' tails, which were not the best accompaniment to the burgers, perhaps, as they are on the heavy side, but they were delicious nonetheless.\n\nLike others have mentioned, I found the sweet potato fries really difficult to eat, and I prefer fries with more starchy softness in the middle than the potato stick kind.  The salad was lovely, though - a dressed-up version of the salad that comes with the steak at Central Kitchen.\n\nOn service: we had much better service than I had the last time I came, though I still think the waiting area is beyond awkward because there isn't really one: people resort to standing in the handicapped ramp, in the doorway, in front of the hostess stand, and are generally in the way wherever they stand.  The service, though, was not pretentious like it was the last time, but attentive without being overbearing (unlike the overzealous service at Gaslight).  Water glasses were refilled whenever necessary, service didn't seem hectic or hurried (I hate when servers are rushing around everywhere; it ruins any chance the you'll have a relaxing time).  We felt especially pampered by the insertion of a few surprise bites: an amuse bouche before dinner, and a few sweet bites at the end - the standout was a tea-infused (assam tea, I think, but my memories are a bit hazy) panna cotta that was on the acidic side - it must have had yogurt or creme fraiche in it.  I have to say that I dislike the tiny madeleines that come with the check, but that's a personal blanket dislike - I just find that the smaller the madeleine, the drier it gets.  To conclude regarding service, I wonder if the difference in service was just a matter of Craigie hitting its stride, or whether it's just better to have a larger party?  I guess time will tell.  Oh, one other thing - I love that the bar at Craigie is open late - in fact, our reservation was for 9:30pm and though we were seated promptly, we didn't make it out until nearly 12am.\n\nA word to other reviewers (this is not directed to the restaurant): though Craigie is delightful, it isn't a neighborhood place.  The majority of those of us who live in the neighborhood can't afford it, and those of us who can have to save up to eat there."]
['Our dinner at Craige on Main has to be described more as "culinary entertainment" than a regular meal.  While my wife and I usually get in and out of a restaurant in about one hour, we lingered at Craige for over two.  My wife and I, not wanting to make difficult choices, decided to go with the Six-Course Tasting Menu.  This consisted of 6 dishes, all of which without exception were far from anything I had had anywhere else previously, much less something I would have been able to make myself, ranging from squid noodles (not noodles WITH squid but noodles made FROM squid), to "sabre fish" and ending in "sweetbreads in lobster sauce".  I have to admit, I had to look this last one up on my iPhone as we sat at the table.  Turns out, "sweetbread" is the culinary name for thymus gland.  Maybe I am just redneck more familiar with BBQ than haute cuisine, but this was a first for me, and it was excellent!  Our culinary adventure continued to roasted bone marrow, and although I am not a fan of this extremely heavy dish, I need to take the blame myself, as this was one of several side choices and therefore the only dish we actually ordered ourselves.  Don\'t be alarmed when you see the portion sizes.  At the end of the meal, between the 3 amuse-bouches, the sorbets prior to the desert and the bread, your 6 courses ends up being more like 8 and you don\'t leave the restaurant hungry.  Before starting the meal, we ordered some excellent cocktails from the bar.  The only disappointment of the night was, that we had planned to start there, but it was full when we arrived.  Our waiter was superb.  She explained in detail every one of the complicated dishes, that just after hearing them, my wife and I usually boiled down to "some kind of rabbit" or "two types of duck" summaries.  Our waiter noticed I was not drinking my beer and inquired if there was an issue.  When I indicated it was OK but not quite what I liked, she immediately offered to exchange it for a glass of wine she thought would go better with the meal.  I declined, but after about 10 minutes, she came back and insisted.  Everyone in the restaurant, from the valet boy who opened the door, to the chef that came out to explain the main dish, were extremely friendly.  We paid almost $280 for the two of us (and my wife had no alcohol after the initial cocktail).  Although it will be a while before we come back, we will most certainly do so.']
["What a perfect place to celebrate our anniversary. The food was spectacular, the service was excellent,. The appetizer of octopus was like nothing we had ever experienced. as was the foie gras. The preparation of the sea trout was perfect.. We shared the grits for dessert. Just perfect for a winter evening. The staff was caring without being intrusive. The open kitchen was such fun to watch.. We can't wait to return to experience more beautiful and interesting flavors."]
["Having recently moved back to Boston from NYC, I can honestly say this has been my most favorite overall restaurant experience so far. They set the bar in terms of service in Boston. The employees there actually seem happy to work there and that shows as soon as you walk in the door. The wine list was great with some unusual options. The food was amazing. We shared the fois gras to start followed by the rabbit  and octopus appetizers. For entrees we had the trout (yum), chicken (most tender chicken I've ever had), and the steak (impressive). All dishes were well executed and seasoned. My new favorite!"]
['Fantastic.  My wife and I have been wanting to go here for a while, and last night we finally got around to going.  We had a great table in the corner, affording us a view of the open kitchen as well as all the other tables.  The wait staff was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive.  And of course, the food was out of this world.  We had the 6-course tasting dinner, consisting of 2 seafoods, 1 soup, 1 vegetable, 1 meat, and dessert.  The absolute standout of the evening was the spring onion soup with a grilled cheese sandwich made with cheese from Borough Market in London (which we had just visited in January).  The soup was creamy and tasted just like spring should taste, and the sandwich was quite possibly the most perfect grilled cheese sandwich in existence.  Also fantastic was the yellowtail tuna over avocado and the lamb trifecta - loin, tongue, and sweetbreads.  I would heartily recommend CoM to anybody who loves food.']

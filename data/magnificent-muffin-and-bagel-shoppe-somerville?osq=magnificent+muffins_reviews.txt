["Mmmmmmmmmmuffins.\n\nThey have muffins fresh baked, pulled straight off the muffin pan with the giant muffin top. And they're all delicious.\n\nThey have breakfast sandwiches on their bagels which are also delicious.\n\nIt is, somehow, still highly affordable. \n\nYou need a delicious breakfast fix. You need magnificent muffins.\n\nCash only!"]
["The four stars are for the muffins - SO EXCELLENT. They're huge, moist, and come in a ton of flavors. I also love the staff, super friendly and a great local feel. \n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are good, but just average (I'd give them a 3 without the muffins)."]
['Best place to get breakfast on the go in Somerville came here this morning with my boyfriend to get our usual. You NEED to try their muffins and make sure you asked for it grilled with butter, nothing tastes better then a nice warm muffin with a little butter on it. I also really love hat they finally added avocado to their menu as well. They have everything you need to eat for breakfast. Make sure you have a lot of patience tho because there lines can get crazy especially on the weekends.']
['Real eggs! Coffee and muffins are also amazing. So many different flavor options cream cheese.\nBut please bring back the spinach bagels.']
["Came in here from based on the Yelp reviews\n\nI was so happy to see they have such a wide variety of roasted coffee flavors, I love that they don't use syrup\n\nThe staff is so friendly, nice, and personal.\n\nIt was such a nice experience getting a coffee and bagel. It's rare to come across such nice people when getting your morning coffee at 9am\n\nThe food quality is amazing !! The bagels, muffins, and breakfast sandwhiches are always very tasty. Everything is fresh and so delicious\n\nStreet Parking available"]
["3.5 stars, but I liked the vibe of the place so I'm happy to round up!\n\nThe muffins are very good--easily 4 stars. Super light and fluffy inside paired with an oversized muffin top created by dousing the muffin tin in batter. Really cool idea!\n\nThe egg sandwich was a solid 3 star for me. No complaints, but nothing special. Matched expectations for a $4 egg sandwich"]
["MagMuffs is where it's at, y'all.\n\nThis little shop has a big line in the summertime, and for good reason: their breakfast (which is CASH ONLY) is quite good.\n\nI don't drink coffee, but I've had most of their menu by now and their muffins really are magnificent. I also like the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. Favorite bagel? Sundried tomato poppy!\n\nMost of why I like this place is the mom and pop vibe, the friendly banter while waiting for my order, and the feeling that this is an authentic old-Somerville establishment: still kicking it, and still making great food!\n\nOne pro-tip: these guys close sharply at noon everyday!"]
["I think I spent half my years' salary here. I absolutely love this place and used to live near by. I make a point to stop here anytime I'm in Somerville before noon. I've never had a bad breakfast sandwich here. It's cash only but totally worth the trip to the ATM right next door."]
['While I waited for my tire to be repaired nearby, I came here for a quick bite to eat.  I got a breakfast sandwich on a croissant.  Hooray for real eggs!  There were a handful of tables outside, so I ate there.  Also, I sampled some muffins while I waited for my food and they were pretty yummy.']
["The coffee is weak and acrid.\nCustomer service is hit or miss (I've had great and horrible both... If you see the tall blonde woman at the counter turn around and leave, everyone else would be just fine!) \nI'm not a bagel geek but I'll tell you they're not extra special. The meat and sausage and overall send which is pretty good.\nsaving the best for last- the double chocolate muffin is killer!! As in really really really good. \nFour stars just for that"]
['Always quick and easy breakfast sandwich, coffee always fresh.\nStaff is friendly and very good at moving orders along.']
["I live next door to this place. I go EVERY weekend and even wake up extra early some mornings to go here (and I LOVE sleep so that should say enough about this place). This is my second favorite bagel shop I've ever been to. I always bring friends here and they're amazed by how delicious and amazing their bagels, muffins, and egg sandwiches are. I can't emphasize enough how amazing this place is, seriously! Everyone I know who lives remotely near Davis is obsessed with this place - for a good reason! The line can be a little long and it can get busy in there so it's best to call ahead to order or to go earlier rather than later! I would give Magnificent Muffin 10 stars if I could. Never once had a bad experience here and I've been well over 50 times. Continually amazing customer service, the staff are friendly, know customers by name (which is amazing because of how popular it is), and are cheerful with everyone."]
["This review is mostly for the disappointing customer service we received...\n\nAfter having been to the Medford location countless times we accidentally ended up at this location (both locations are equidistant from us but we somehow never tried this one). Since we were familiar with the other location's menu, we asked if some of our favorite flavors of muffin were available (there were NO LABELS, so it wasn't obvious what flavors were available) which really seemed to annoy the cashier. We also were met with annoyance when we asked any other questions or didn't know exactly what we wanted to order. There was no one behind us in line so I do not understand why we were so rushed. I felt very stressed out by the whole experience and even though it is the same distance for me, I will not be coming back and will stick with the Medford location. Not a good first impression for a long time customer... (The food and coffee, by the way were excellent)."]
["If you want something that tastes like a true NY bagel, Mag Muff is your spot! Finally found a spot for a delicious deli style BEC. And make sure to try a grilled muffin, you won't be disappointed!!"]
["From my apartment in Teele Square, I can see the lines at MagMu stretch around the block, especially in nicer weather. If you have the self-discipline to rise early or smart enough to call you order ahead, you won't have to stand in that terrible line or wait in the tiny space inside. \n\nI usually get the everything bagel with sausage/egg/cheese. When I'm eating it, it's the most delicious thing in the world. The bagel is soft but chewy in the right way and the warm fat/salt combo of the rest puts me in a food delirium. I always feel gross after eating one though. Much like eating Five Guys, I only eat it a few times a year, usually after enough time has passed that I forget how it made me feel the last time. \n\nI don't recommend the coffee, but also don't walk in with a Starbucks cup, they don't take kindly to it. Walk in with a smile and you'll get pleasant and quick service back. \n\nIf nothing else, you MUST try their muffins. They truly are Magnificent. Huge tops (who likes the stumps, anyway, amiright), and lots of different flavors. I love the lemon poppyseed and the red velvet."]
["Their food is awesome but the experience of ordering is extremely stressful. All I can say is that you better know what you want before you arrive because if you so much as stutter or don't speak at the rate that they want they will yell at you and take your head off. On a positive note, now the people who yell at you are young college students instead of old curmudgeonly women. \n\nIf you can withstand the emotional and verbal abuse, it's worth a trip."]
["This joint is a neighborhood staple. Four stars instead of five just because of the times I've had to wait in that miserable line. Tip: if you don't like standing in Disney World lines to get a slapped together mess of a breakfast sandwich, go before 9:30. If you do get there early, the quality of the service and final product is way better! I love bacon, eggs, and cheddar on a French toast bagel - it's like having a full breakfast on the go, and at a great price.\n\nIf you're picking something up to bring home, GO WITH THE MUFFINS. This place is like the DSW equivalent of muffin shops. They have every flavor you could ever want! My personal favorites are apple cinnamon, lemon poppyseed, and pistachio. There's usually a plate on the counter with some broken up muffins to sample, and the staff is friendliest when you ask them for their muffin suggestions."]
["Starchy, bitter bagels toasted and sandwiched with all the grace of a school lunch line.\n\nAt ~$3 for meat, egg, cheese on a your choice of bagel, I'm not expecting haute cuisine. Expectations: met. The bagel, a namesake product preceded by the lofty Magnificent, is so incredibly dry, tough as leather in the untoasted parts and almost acrid with way too much baking soda.\n\nThey take cash, they don't take any shit (rumors of this being the Land That Smile Forgot run true) and they give cafeteria grade fodder. Can't say I won't go back, just like I can't say I'd never eat a 7-11 Big Bite hot dog again, but you better believe I'll feel just as cruddy afterwards."]
["This place is great! They accept call-ahead orders and serve real eggs (not frozen!). Staff is generally friendly and sweet, though it can be a bit tough on newbies who don't know the process. Definitely worth a visit!"]

Never once had a bad experience here and I've been well over 50 times. Continually amazing customer service, the staff are friendly, know customers by name (which is amazing because of how popular it is), and are cheerful with everyone."]
["This review is mostly for the disappointing customer service we received...\n\nAfter having been to the Medford location countless times we accidentally ended up at this location (both locations are equidistant from us but we somehow never tried this one). Since we were familiar with the other location's menu, we asked if some of our favorite flavors of muffin were available (there were NO LABELS, so it wasn't obvious what flavors were available) which really seemed to annoy the cashier. We also were met with annoyance when we asked any other questions or didn't know exactly what we wanted to order. There was no one behind us in line so I do not understand why we were so rushed. I felt very stressed out by the whole experience and even though it is the same distance for me, I will not be coming back and will stick with the Medford location. Not a good first impression for a long time customer... (The food and coffee, by the way were excellent)."]
["If you want something that tastes like a true NY bagel, Mag Muff is your spot! Finally found a spot for a delicious deli style BEC. And make sure to try a grilled muffin, you won't be disappointed!!"]
["From my apartment in Teele Square, I can see the lines at MagMu stretch around the block, especially in nicer weather. If you have the self-discipline to rise early or smart enough to call you order ahead, you won't have to stand in that terrible line or wait in the tiny space inside. \n\nI usually get the everything bagel with sausage/egg/cheese. When I'm eating it, it's the most delicious thing in the world. The bagel is soft but chewy in the right way and the warm fat/salt combo of the rest puts me in a food delirium. I always feel gross after eating one though. Much like eating Five Guys, I only eat it a few times a year, usually after enough time has passed that I forget how it made me feel the last time. \n\nI don't recommend the coffee, but also don't walk in with a Starbucks cup, they don't take kindly to it. Walk in with a smile and you'll get pleasant and quick service back. \n\nIf nothing else, you MUST try their muffins. They truly are Magnificent. Huge tops (who likes the stumps, anyway, amiright), and lots of different flavors. I love the lemon poppyseed and the red velvet."]
["Their food is awesome but the experience of ordering is extremely stressful. All I can say is that you better know what you want before you arrive because if you so much as stutter or don't speak at the rate that they want they will yell at you and take your head off. On a positive note, now the people who yell at you are young college students instead of old curmudgeonly women. \n\nIf you can withstand the emotional and verbal abuse, it's worth a trip."]
["This joint is a neighborhood staple. Four stars instead of five just because of the times I've had to wait in that miserable line. Tip: if you don't like standing in Disney World lines to get a slapped together mess of a breakfast sandwich, go before 9:30. If you do get there early, the quality of the service and final product is way better! I love bacon, eggs, and cheddar on a French toast bagel - it's like having a full breakfast on the go, and at a great price.\n\nIf you're picking something up to bring home, GO WITH THE MUFFINS. This place is like the DSW equivalent of muffin shops. They have every flavor you could ever want! My personal favorites are apple cinnamon, lemon poppyseed, and pistachio. There's usually a plate on the counter with some broken up muffins to sample, and the staff is friendliest when you ask them for their muffin suggestions."]
["Starchy, bitter bagels toasted and sandwiched with all the grace of a school lunch line.\n\nAt ~$3 for meat, egg, cheese on a your choice of bagel, I'm not expecting haute cuisine. Expectations: met. The bagel, a namesake product preceded by the lofty Magnificent, is so incredibly dry, tough as leather in the untoasted parts and almost acrid with way too much baking soda.\n\nThey take cash, they don't take any shit (rumors of this being the Land That Smile Forgot run true) and they give cafeteria grade fodder. Can't say I won't go back, just like I can't say I'd never eat a 7-11 Big Bite hot dog again, but you better believe I'll feel just as cruddy afterwards."]
["This place is great! They accept call-ahead orders and serve real eggs (not frozen!). Staff is generally friendly and sweet, though it can be a bit tough on newbies who don't know the process. Definitely worth a visit!"]
['Having such a wonderful bagel shop within walking distance is a real treat. Magnificent has some outstanding bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and we love the iced coffee.']
["Mmmmmmmmmmuffins.\n\nThey have muffins fresh baked, pulled straight off the muffin pan with the giant muffin top. And they're all delicious.\n\nThey have breakfast sandwiches on their bagels which are also delicious.\n\nIt is, somehow, still highly affordable. \n\nYou need a delicious breakfast fix. You need magnificent muffins.\n\nCash only!"]
["The four stars are for the muffins - SO EXCELLENT. They're huge, moist, and come in a ton of flavors. I also love the staff, super friendly and a great local feel. \n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are good, but just average (I'd give them a 3 without the muffins)."]
['Best place to get breakfast on the go in Somerville came here this morning with my boyfriend to get our usual. You NEED to try their muffins and make sure you asked for it grilled with butter, nothing tastes better then a nice warm muffin with a little butter on it. I also really love hat they finally added avocado to their menu as well. They have everything you need to eat for breakfast. Make sure you have a lot of patience tho because there lines can get crazy especially on the weekends.']
['Real eggs! Coffee and muffins are also amazing. So many different flavor options cream cheese.\nBut please bring back the spinach bagels.']
["Came in here from based on the Yelp reviews\n\nI was so happy to see they have such a wide variety of roasted coffee flavors, I love that they don't use syrup\n\nThe staff is so friendly, nice, and personal.\n\nIt was such a nice experience getting a coffee and bagel. It's rare to come across such nice people when getting your morning coffee at 9am\n\nThe food quality is amazing !! The bagels, muffins, and breakfast sandwhiches are always very tasty. Everything is fresh and so delicious\n\nStreet Parking available"]
["3.5 stars, but I liked the vibe of the place so I'm happy to round up!\n\nThe muffins are very good--easily 4 stars. Super light and fluffy inside paired with an oversized muffin top created by dousing the muffin tin in batter. Really cool idea!\n\nThe egg sandwich was a solid 3 star for me. No complaints, but nothing special. Matched expectations for a $4 egg sandwich"]
["MagMuffs is where it's at, y'all.\n\nThis little shop has a big line in the summertime, and for good reason: their breakfast (which is CASH ONLY) is quite good.\n\nI don't drink coffee, but I've had most of their menu by now and their muffins really are magnificent. I also like the bacon egg and cheese on a bagel. Favorite bagel? Sundried tomato poppy!\n\nMost of why I like this place is the mom and pop vibe, the friendly banter while waiting for my order, and the feeling that this is an authentic old-Somerville establishment: still kicking it, and still making great food!\n\nOne pro-tip: these guys close sharply at noon everyday!"]
["I think I spent half my years' salary here. I absolutely love this place and used to live near by. I make a point to stop here anytime I'm in Somerville before noon. I've never had a bad breakfast sandwich here. It's cash only but totally worth the trip to the ATM right next door."]
['While I waited for my tire to be repaired nearby, I came here for a quick bite to eat.  I got a breakfast sandwich on a croissant.  Hooray for real eggs!  There were a handful of tables outside, so I ate there.  Also, I sampled some muffins while I waited for my food and they were pretty yummy.']
["The coffee is weak and acrid.\nCustomer service is hit or miss (I've had great and horrible both... If you see the tall blonde woman at the counter turn around and leave, everyone else would be just fine!) \nI'm not a bagel geek but I'll tell you they're not extra special. The meat and sausage and overall send which is pretty good.\nsaving the best for last- the double chocolate muffin is killer!! As in really really really good. \nFour stars just for that"]
['Always quick and easy breakfast sandwich, coffee always fresh.\nStaff is friendly and very good at moving orders along.']
["I live next door to this place. I go EVERY weekend and even wake up extra early some mornings to go here (and I LOVE sleep so that should say enough about this place).

Can't say I won't go back, just like I can't say I'd never eat a 7-11 Big Bite hot dog again, but you better believe I'll feel just as cruddy afterwards."]
["This place is great! They accept call-ahead orders and serve real eggs (not frozen!). Staff is generally friendly and sweet, though it can be a bit tough on newbies who don't know the process. Definitely worth a visit!"]
['Having such a wonderful bagel shop within walking distance is a real treat. Magnificent has some outstanding bagels, breakfast sandwiches, and we love the iced coffee.']

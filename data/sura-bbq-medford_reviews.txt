["I'm a regular that goes to this restaurant almost every week with my friends. We LOVE how cheap it is for an ALL YOU CAN EAT menu. You guys go to a supermarket and the finest of the fine meat costs over $30 for just one small plate while here it is only 28.95 per person. The waitresses and waiters slowly explain how if you're hungry you can do the All You Can Eat menu but if you're not you can comply for their Combo Sets. \n\nI've been been there on their slow days, moderately okay days and on their extremely busy days. If you are a first time goer and come in on a weekend DON'T GO and if you do go try to be patient because you're just not used to the busy atmosphere. It's so busy on Friday and Saturday's. Expect to wait if you don't have a reservation. This place has DELICIOUS food and that's the reason why it gets so busy. The waitress and waitresses always have a smile on their faces no matter how tiring and hectic it gets try to give them a good tip. Remember: they are not only serving you they're also literally cooking and cutting the food for you. \n\nPeople on here are so negative, getting stingy over no rice being served. Of course if a restaurant as busy as this one doesn't serve you a small thing like rice or extra bean paste ASK THEM. Don't just sit there smiling and acting like nothing is wrong and then turning your back an writing a negative review. Just plain cancer. You obviously don't know that when things get busy and if you're just sitting there not eating they will give you the bill because they just ASSUME you are done with your meal."]
['From the moment we got in the door it was kind of chaotic.  Everyone scrambling around including the host who just kind of pointed in the direction of our table.  We ordered the combo for two with beef short ribs and bulgogi pork and squid. \n\nOnce we are seated various waitresses came but just threw things on the table and left.  No one stopped for a second to ask if we understood how the menu worked or to tell us what they are putting on the table.  Every time I had a question about the menu I had to catch them before they ran away and it seemed like an inconvenience for them. \n\nA waitress came over and put all of the meat at once on the grill and walked away.  Then a few minutes later brought veggies. The meat takes very few minutes to cook so we were trying to get it off the grill before it over cooked.  Then the veggies take 3 times the amount of time than the meat to cook, so you end up eating everything separate.  I would have liked to place half the meat at once along with some veggies.  They were cooking the purple rice and asked if we wanted to wait for it,  we said yes but it never came. \n\nNo one ever came to ask if we needed anything the entire time we were there.  Instead a waitress rushed by halfway through the meal and put the check on the table and walked away.  My friend said, "I guess they are kicking us out " and it sure felt that way from beginning to end. \n\nI wouldn\'t go back.  Overall the food just Okay. Nothing in particular about the meal stood out.']
["It's about 30 dollars a person for All You Can Eat Course B dinner before tax &amp; tip. We ordered Prime Brisket, Galbi short ribs, Squid, and octopus. The Prime Brisket was pretty low quality, but because it is sliced thin, it doesn't taste that bad. Can't ask for juicy meat in an All You Can Eat, so didn't expect too much. \n\nThe squid and the octopus were very good. Nothing like grilled squid."]
["Went here with 3 friends and had a very positive experience. We got course B for all you can eat on a Friday night. All of the meats were great, and unlike other all you can eat places (like AYCE sushi) I didn't leave filling sick to my stomach, despite having tons of food. Most exceptional about this restaurant, however, was the service. We had several friendly and attentive severs, and what looked like the owner/manager even came over on a few occasions to check on us. \nI'd definitely recommend checking this place out."]
['This is a nice place for Korean BBQ food for all you can eat with ambled parking on the back, wait staff is pleasant &amp; kind, this place has a friendly atmosphere. This is a nice place to try out at least ones for the full experience to have taste all the different flavor meat for a Korean BBQ place.']
["I wanted to give 4 stars, but as they keep asking us to pay (they want us to leave early even though there are several tables available and no people waiting in line), I decide to give it 3 stars. \n\nThere's a parking lot in the back. So it's convenient to drive there. You can enter from the back door too. \n\nWe didn't have the buffet $20+, but we got combo for 2 $30+.  It comes with rice, salad, pancake, steamed egg, tofu stew, vegetables and selected 2 dishes from the buffet menu. I would say it's enough for 2 persons. Everything tastes good even though I wish they give me lettuce to wrap the meat. I think it's a good deal in general."]
["Came here with my family.\nI came here twice before it became all you can eat.\n\nWorth it for the amount of meat we ordered, the ribeye was was tender. When we cooked it we squeeze some of the sauce they gave us over it so it soaked in.\n\nThey let you start off with 5 different meat that you pick from their menu, when you are almost done with it you can order more but they ask you to only pick 5 in the beginning. \n\nIt comes with sides,  but we ran through it so quick, I think we had to ask them to refill it 3 or 4 times, but they were really nice about it.\n\nI also ordered a banana shake, which I liked. My sister and brother in law ordered mango and some other fruit but didn't care too much for it. \n\nI would come back, it's nice and fun to do, even on a date. (They sell wines and beers too!)\n\nEnjoy!"]
['2 star usually means, I would make at least one another visit but...damn...\n\nIf you gotta increase the price, that I DO understand, but you don\'t ever take away the items you provided this drastically, and maintain that same price point. You are not ever suppose make back step.\n\nThis is probably my 5th visit, and I just made my last visit since early this year. Usually my gf and I always go for combo A for two, number one reason being, we just can\'t eat a lot but certainly finish original combo A\n\nOriginal - Pancake, dumplings, steamed egg, stew, and 3 choice of meat\n\nnow its take out (pancake or dumpling of your choice), and one less choice of meat.\n\nAs soon as I saw the updated menu I\'m like "$%!FG"\n\nDidn\'t see the ssam(vege to eat with meats, not the one they now serve now)\n\ndumpling definitely changed...significantly lost its size as well...\n\nJust wondering what the management is thinking. Kinda got excited today since I didn\'t had korean foods for awhile...until foods arrived  \n\nThis change permanently ends my visit here now.']
["I love korean bbq, and it got me excited to know it's a buffet.\nNot much choices on meat, but enough to fulfill the empty stomach. \nMeats weren't marinated well, just kalbi and the bulgogi were good. I liked steam egg pot.\nThe portions they brought out were so little, my husband and I'd finished it one setting, we had to keep waving for the waiters, there were many of them around, but they kept walking and looking straight without pay attention to our table, it's hard to get them for anything, we stayed there over 1 hour and we only got 2 rounds of meat, we left there with our bellies not full and not satisfied at all. I felt like it's a waste of my time spending here, from  my place to get here is 30min., not worth it for both money and time. \nIf the food is good, I wouldn't mind driving even 1 hour and doesn't matter how much it cost.\nIt was my first time here and probably not going back."]
["I ate at Sura in RI before. Glad they came to MA!\n\nIt was after work when I got there. There were quite few a people there. We were seated and ordered right away. They didn't bring out the regular side dishes besides the bean sprout, kimchi, pickled carrots and radish but I didn't bother asking either. The meat quality isn't bad and they come out in a good amount. I love the spicy pork. The thin pork belly was ok... just go for the black pork belly (thick). Shrimp will come with shell on. The beef tongue is bleh. We ordered the LA RIB and other meat from course B. I think I was stuffed by then to really enough it. The kimchi tasted good and has a amount of spice.\n\nThe dumplings weren't that great, scallion pancakes on the other hand was . Tofu stew was good. I didn't order anything out of the norm.\n\nI would definitely go again.\n\n3 people -$94 with taxes. We didn't order drinks."]
['Craving all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ? This is a great place for Korean BBQ glutiny. Be prepared to get your fill of meat. They were able to accommodate our party of 16 for a same day reservation. Street parking only. Efficient servers and support staff.']
["Came here with a small group of 3 people and large group of about 12 people. \nJust spend the money and get Group B (which includes group A)! It's worth it.\nMeat is pretty good. Favorite is of course the prime brisket, short rib, and pork belly. The black pork belly is yum too.\nWaitstaff always seems upset when we order more but it's all you can eat.. and we come hungry!! \nProbably the best kbbq in the Boston area and not for a bad price. \nLots of yummy banchan too! Will come here for my kbbq needs."]
["This was my 2nd visit to Sura and I have to say, I really liked my experience this time.  Here is why:\n\n*Service has greatly improved (they have more staff and they are more organized this time, especially when it got super busy around dinner time)\n*Meat selection was delicious.  I did go with Course A again so I cannot comment on Course B (but Let's be honest, besides thin brisket, pork belly, marinated pork and marinated beef....what else could you need???)\n*Salad was delicious - refreshing dressing! \n*Scallion Pancake.  Is it just me or was this really the best Scallion Pancake I've ever had???? My goodness it was crispy, fresh, warm and really flavorful.  I didn't even need the dipping sauce\n*Ssamjang and BBQ dipping sauces are already at your table in squeeze bottles.  This is new to me (most restaurants have them already in your dipping plate or you have to request but I secretly really liked this squeeze bottle option... I could use all or as very little sauce I wanted :)\n\nA few things to note: If you've had KBBQ in NYC and LA then you're like me and already asking for rice paper, garlic and sesame oil.  I think a good KBBQ restaurant (whether AYCE or A La Carte) should have all those essentials to compliment your meal, but you have to ask for those here.  And unfortunately, they do not have rice paper so you're going to have to do without.  But TBH, I will take that.  I had a good experience this time and will definitely be back!"]
['AYCE Korean BBQ is a rarity around Boston. There are definitely some decent Korean fare around, but you pay the price for them.  Sura is a solid mix between various cuts of meat and a semi reasonable cost.\n\nWe came as a large party of 12 was seated immediately. We had some Korean speaking people within our group which made the interactions with the waiters and waitresses that much smoother. They give you different options of AYCE from A to C, C being the one with the most choices. We went with C and meat wise, there was a huge variety to choose from with cuts that were not that bad in quality.  I would avoid the side soups they offer as the ones we ordered were bland or just plain bad.\n\nThe final price was above what I would have liked to pay, but the variety somewhat made up for it. If I am in the area again and am seriously craving some AYCE KBBQ, I will check this place out.']
["A lot of food for what you pay! Food selection was extensive. We wished we could eat more. All the meat we ordered was good except beef intestine. Maybe that's how they're supposed to be but it was our first time ordering beef intestine and didn't really like it much. Seafood pancake was awesome! I'll definitely get that again when I go back. Service was excellent and easy parking."]
["Calm but casual atmosphere and good quality meat\nLunch special was $18.95 per person for all you can eat\nStaff/service was good, the waiter did not fill up water frequently, but it wasn't that much of a problem\nI haven't been to any other all you can eat restaurants, but this one in specific asked before bringing out more food (I would think this would happen everywhere but I'm not sure) \nYou will get charged if you leave leftover meat\nI would recommend the thinly sliced pork belly and the prime brisket\nI would not recommend getting chicken because it is difficult to cook and the raw chicken contaminates the tongs (the chicken was still fantastic, if you're up to a cooking challenge, go ahead)\nI would not recommend eating rice until the end of the meal because it fills you up\n\nOverall: 11.5/12"]
["I came here with a group of 10 people for the all you can eat Korean bbq deal. It's a little further out from the city so the good thing is it's not that crowded, even on a weekend night. The place is so spacious! There are a lot of other appetizers items on the menu as well that you can order and they are quite delicious. We got the scallion pancakes, fried dumplings, chicken katsu, and steamed eggs. \n\nThey also have a lot of different types of meat that you can put on the grill for the bbq, we tried beef, pork, chicken, etc. you can also order the soft tofu stew. It's expensive but definitely a good deal for a lot of different food you can try. The quality is not top notch but is good for the price. We also ordered a big jar of organic fruits lemonade to share amongst all of us and it was really good!!! We finished that so quickly. The server is a bit forgetful, I'm not sure if it's because they're new but we have to ask them to bring out some of the things we ordered after not seeing them brought out for a really long time. \n\nIt's definitely nice to have more alternatives to choose from when it comes to AYCE. We used to only see hotpot or sushi, and now there is also Korean and Japanese buffet. Way to go Boston (well greater Boston and surrounded area ha ha)"]
["This was probably my 5th time here. A great place to meet up with co workers for drinks and food. Not a real authentic Korean BBQ but more of a Chinese Korean fusion. For the price of unlimited meat, I can't really complain. I like their kalbi and thin slice pork bellies. The service is always ok. Sometime you might not get your food and sometimes they bring out the wrong item. At most time, it can take awhile for them to come and take your order."]
['My boyfriend and I came to Sura BBQ on a Sunday night. Immediately we saw that the restaurant was very large. They had a number of booths and table seats. We went for the "A" course all you can eat bbq. The waiter who first served spoke very quietly and I could barely hear him over the loud chatter and music in the background. We were served our water and 3 side dishes: kimchi,  salad w/ vinaigrette, and radish. The kimchi and salad were good, but the radish wasn\'t pickled enough or at all.. we didn\'t even eat it after the first bite. When we first ordered, we were told we could only order 5 meat dishes at at time. Honestly, 5 meat dishes were enough for two people. I also ordered some side dishes. We ended up trying a majority of the selections and some were better than others. I really enjoyed the marinated thin beef, beef brisket, thin sliced pork and the spicy pork (quite spicy). The other meat dishes were good as well and it all looked fresh. The fried dumplings and the scallion pancake were very crispy! \n\nThere are a number of reasons why I only gave it 3 stars. First, I think $25.95 per person is a reasonable price point if you do take advantage of all you can eat. The service was quite slow for a Sunday night. There were a lot of waitresses and waiters, but most of them didn\'t understand English when I asked them to lower to stove or for more napkins. They were nice enough to fill our waters, but it was rare when they came by to cook the food. We mostly did it ourselves.. which is fine if there was only better lighting. The restaurant lighting was mostly dim, so I couldn\'t tell if the chicken or pork meat was fully cooked. I awkwardly used my phone\'s flash light to check. My boyfriend ended up biting into some food that was still uncooked. Another thing was the smoke from the bbq. I don\'t know if it was our fan or if we had too much food/fat on the grill, but we had a lot of smoke coming out by the 3rd time we added food to the grill. Smoke was blowing in our faces, and no one came by to turn the heat of our stove down until I requested it. My eyeliner started running and let me tell you, it wasn\'t the cutest date night. In the end, they only charged extra for uneaten cooked meat. I\'m not really sure what they do with the rest of the uncooked meat at the table.. I think over all it was an ok experience. Nothing wowed me even though it\'s all you can eat.']
["Was a little wary because the reviews seem so mixed. But I have to say our Korean food craving was fulfilled pretty well here.\n\nThe AYCE deal here can't be beat. Such a good value considering 1) you rarely find AYCE kbbq around Boston and 2) it's not just the meat that is included! Pancake, dumplings, tofu soup, steamed egg, rice -- you name it, it's ALL you can eat. So there is no excuse that you will be full and satisfied at the end of your meal. The one downfall is the lack of variety in their banchan offering. It's just kimchi, radish and bean sprouts but who cares to fill up on that stuff anyway when you're about to beast on 2 kinds of kalbi, spicy pork belly, seafood, veggies -- do I need to keep going?\n\nService can be a little slow to get someone's attention at times. But on the other hand, I felt like they came around often for water refills and offered to change our grill without prompting. I like that parking isn't a pain like it can be in Allston or Cambridge. It may not be the most refined option for a Korean meal but if you are really hungry, come and get 'em at Sura."]
['Three star and a half.\nWe came here for its "All you can it". We conclude that it worths us to come here.\nFirst the price is fair. They have multiple choices of meat including chicken beef and pork. Our favorite choices were beef tongue, marinated thin beef, and beef intestine. \nHowever, some meat choices like ribeye and thick slices of beef are not palatable, because they are not marinated and so thick that they have no flavor even after they are cooked. In addition, we tried the steamed egg, and it tastes really weird.\nWe still think this place worths visiting again because of its fair price and several nice beef dishes.']
["I had a terrific experience here with my husband and in-laws. None of us had tried korean bbq before, and the manager was so patient with all of our questions. He recommended order combinations and then basically cooked our food for us. Every seat in the restaurant was full, so I was really impressed by the time he spent on us. \n\nThe food itself was delicious and a good bargain for the money considering the amount of meat we each ate. My favorites were the prime rib, the thin sliced pork belly, and the calamari. We will definitely be back. \n\nTip for parking -- there's a small lot in the back of building if you can't find space on the street out front."]
["The staff was nice but so slow and always forgot half our orders. Unless you're an absolute meat lover, you probably won't get the most out of the buffet. But if you like a variety of foods (meats, seafood, vegetables) you won't find that here. Also, the grill burned too quickly; I've never seen the grill changed so many times in one sitting. That was annoying because we spent most of the time waiting for the grill to be hot enough to cook anything; the moment you finish cooking one round of food, the grill was too burnt to do another round. \nAs for the food, everything is simply tolerable, that's it. No unique flavor or spices and the quality is nothing special either. Unfortunately, Sura was not worth the drive up and I don't see myself returning."]
["$28.95 for AYCE KBBQ- sold.\n\nTucked in a row of shops close to Ebisuya, this hidden gem for all KBBQ fans on a budget is awesome. For a price that low, I did not walk in to expect prime quality of meats, seafoods, and etc. Rather, the experience should be based on the price range and how much you would have otherwise ended up paying when ordering a la carte at a KBBQ restaurant in Allston or Burlington.\n\nMeat wise, my party and I have the same opinion. Go for Course B for $28.95 so you can get the better selection of meat. Course A at $25.95 have fewer selection and what we had ordered in those selections, we didn't like it that much.\n\nTop on the priority, go for the Black pig pork belly. It's that good. The LA kalbi and the beef short ribs are equally as good - though I did find the marinade a tad too sweet. My companies have no such complaint, must be me then.\n\nShrimps that we had ordered wasn't that great. The pork chops and ribeye were not impressive - too much fat. We only managed two rounds of meat, but hey, we were satisfied with the meal. Also had two orders of sundubu, mandu, steamed egg, an order of chicken Katsu and tons of kimchi and cabbage slaw. \n\nThe condiments are standard- ssamjang and bulgogi sauce. Show them you are the pro and asked for sesame oil with salt n pepper, sliced fresh garlic, and sliced chilies on the side. The server will even bring out fresh lettuce leaves for you to make your ssam. I asked if they offer the rice sheets and thinly sliced pickled radish but they don't. \n\nThere's a sweet girl working there who kept coming to our table to change our grill. Thank you! I should have asked you for your name. \n\nOh, about the grill- it takes forever to get hot. Your food will take a while to cook because of that but you shall be rewarded with juicy charred succulent morsels of protein when the grill plate eventually get up to temperature. \n\nWill return when we are in the mood for KBBQ feast."]
["Went in and got menu items since their all-you-can-eat BBQ was too pricey for me that night. They served us some sides, and didn't explain what any of them were, including some sauces. Then, while we were munching on the sides, they came back and took our orders, and whisked away the sauces with no explanation. My miso soup went to my dining partner instead of me, which I didn't realize until they brought out the entrees and got us confused. The food was fine, I got a sizzling plate, but nothing amazing with the flavors.\n\nFood is okay, service is kind of slow and strange with little explanation, not sure I'll be back."]
['Incredible food. Friendly staff. Amazing value.\n\nTheir pork bulgogi and scallion pancake are addictive!']
["Me and my friend like to eat here whenever we hang out, we like Korean food because they are Good, unlimited serving and nice people who work there. The only thing is they don't have bibimbap which is my favorite but other than that, the food they serve was good. Will totally recommend"]
["Despite being the first customers just before noon on a Sunday, the management wouldn't turn down the music. The food was bland and frozen thinly sliced meat just doesn't acquire much flavor from their method of grilling. Service was robotic. Atmosphere was like a warehouse. And the music was oppressively bad."]
["I've been to the Sura at Rhode Island and was excited that they opened one near Boston. I was hoping to be as good as the one in Johnston. Unfortunately, I did not like the experience here and is willing to go an extra half an hour further just to go to the Johnston location.\n\nwe called to make a reservation for 6PM that morning. When we arrived, an older woman greeted me and told us to sit down because she does not remember our reservation. The host comes and asked us for name and phone number. Nothing on his list. The host said he did reservations all day, there's no way our reservation is not on the list if he had taken it unless we called the wrong location. We checked our call history and double checked to see if it was the correct number. He said yes. How is it possible that we called the correct phone number and talked to someone here but you didnt reserve a table for us? This isn't a big deal, but please own up to your mistakes and don't blame it on us. We proved that we called the correct number, so we did make that reservation. \n\nThey didnt have a table for 5 so they gave us a table for 4 and added a chair at the end, which is OK for us. But the ventilation is HORRIBLE. The vents are all on the ceiling, but the ceiling was super high... oh, they also have the 5 meat and only 1 seafood policy, which Johnston location does not have. I felt restrained on what we wanted to order. \n\nAs the waitress walks by, we tried to flag her down. She completely ignored us.... WHY? We shook our heads and the host saw us so disappointed. He came over to our table and told us to just flag down the waitress if we wanted anything. The more i ate, the more ill i felt sitting there. \n\nMy mother ordered one more meat before we left, we never got it. My mom wanted to leave. The host just said to order from him....\n\nWhen we paid with cash, we needed the change to pay tips... never gave it to us until we asked for it...\n\nSorry will not be coming back"]
['All-you-can-eat bbq menu was confusing and pricey for the amount of food you get. The marinades were not impressive. Perhaps the worst part of our meal was the service. We were essentially pestered throughout our meal and kicked out 11pm on the dot while trying to finish and enjoy the rest of our food. The only part of the meal that was good was the steamed egg, something my parents make back home. At least I had a fond memory here... never coming back. Go to Koreana instead.']
['Formerly Chung Ki Wa, Sura sits in the heart of Medford Square and fits perfectly within the neighborhood.  This all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ meat glory hails originally from Rhode Island, making this commute much more convenient for most of us Bostonians.  The set up, menu, and food are nearly identical to Rhode Islands.  \n\nThe AYCE menu consists of two types, "A" Course and "B" course.  The "B" Course is the better option, as all the items in course "A" is included and you have more \'premium\' items to choose from, such as variations of short rib and seafood.  Their ban chan (small side dishes), athough not as plentiful as a regular Korean restaurant, are tasty.  If anything, the reason why I am not giving this place a full 5 stars is because I believe more ban chan should be offered to accompany the meal.  You have the option of having purple or white rice, which I think is also different from anywhere else I\'ve been.\n\nAlthough the meat is the star, their appetizers and soup dishes are pretty good as well, which is included in the buffet.  Soft Tofu Stew (Chigae), scallion pancake, and their steamed egg are some of our favorites.\n\nSalad is also given to you on the side, however we preferred pain lettuce to make wraps and is available upon request. Another good thing to keep in mind is that in order to prevent waste, the meat is often served in smaller portions per order.  Also, parking is available in metered spots out front and in a lot in the back entrance of the restaurant.\n\nThe staff are friendly and we were thanked for even coming.  We appreciated the hospitality and could definitely see myself coming back']
['All you can eat KBBQ! Delicious food and great company. We came with a large group, order came out perfect.']
['I like this place. Feels traditional. My brother did not like it, but that is mainly because he was expecting Japanese barbeque like gyu kaku. One concern is that one of the older lady cannot speak english, so we had trouble ordering.\n\nI was also a bit confused on the price. I went for dinner once and got charged the full price; went back for lunch and it was still the same price. Would be good to know which days the lunch price applies.']
["Came back here a few months after our first visit. Our first impression of Sura BBQ wasn't that great mostly due to low-quality, under-seasoned food, and inconsistent service. And sadly, our impression remains the same. \n\nThis time, we came here for lunch on a Monday. While the service was much better (relatively speaking), I can't recommend this place to any of my friends or family. I initially said it might be a decent option if someone's craving a large quantity of Korean food. But after our second visit, I can confidently say that this is NOT the Korean restaurant that anyone should visit. Ever. \n\nFor example, one of the key ingredients in most Korean dishes is garlic. And yet, I think it's missing in everything they have including marinades as well as their kimchi. I think that's a significant oversight. I wonder if they intentionally exclude garlic for the purpose of saving money. Adding garlic would seriously elevate their under-seasoned food! \n\nMy wife and I spent $55 total for lunch. That's expensive. And while we did walk out of there feeling full, we weren't satisfied at all. In fact, I found myself forcing meat down just in case Sura BBQ might charge extra for any leftover meat. All of their BBQ meats are underseasoned and the cut of the meat are super low quality. I know, because the meat was chewy. The only dish that had any depth of flavor were the dumplings. And I'm sure they're pre-made frozen dumplings. \n\nIf you're charging $29/person for an all-you-can-eat buffet, the least you could do is season your food well. \n\nDon't waste your money at Sura BBQ. Just walk across the street and grab tortas from Tenoch. It's 100% better than Sura BBQ and you would spend less than $30 for two people. Sure, it's not Korean but at least it's delicious food."]
["I was beyond thrilled to finally find a AYCE Korean BBQ place in Boston area. It's so strange that this is not a thing here, since I was used to having lots of K-BBQ options in Texas. \n\nFood: Delicious with lots of meat choices. We usually go with course B so I haven't tried the hotpot here. My favorite are galbi, LA beef ribs, spicy pork belly and calamari. I wish they can provide more veggie though. The appetizers aren't too bad - fried dumplings and pancake were both ok. Can't beat the price for sure.\n\nService: Friendly and helpful staff. It's so hard to find a Korean place with decent service to be honest.. with the friendly faces here, I enjoy my dinner much more. The manager is always around and makes sure you have all you need. Some Korean servers are very knowledgeable to recommend you great stuff to try. Most of the time, our server was quick to get our order and our food out. \n\nAmbience: Big space with lots of places to seat. Booths are probably the most comfortable (so you can comfortably stuff yourself with yummy food ). It would be so much better if they can add in the ventilator though...\n\nOverall, I love this place and will certainly come back when my K-BBQ craving hits."]
['Sura is a pretty good Korean BBQ restaurant all-around. Went on a Monday night and service was attentive, food came out quickly, and enjoyed the food overall.\n\nWe went with Course A which has a few less options than Course B. Biggest difference in my opinion is the lack of seafood in Course A. Some highlights from Course A were the Prime Brisket, Marinated Thin Beef, Soft Tofu Stew, and Pork Short Ribs. All were really tasty and nicely flavored. \n\nSome low-lights however were the Spicy Pork which was too salty and the Thin Slice Pork Belly which was too fatty. Some pieces were literally all fat. I was also not a huge fan of the Scallion Pancakes. \n\nIt was a good experience and overall, I would recommend this place!']
["Came here with a party of 10 people in early March. The service was really horrible. We had to wave a couple times to get our water refilled. AYCE is great but the food was mediocre. There were a few times that we received the fatty parts of the meat.  Even though there was a time limit, we wanted to take our time to eat all the food but the service seem rushed. If you couldn't grill the meat, then a server would just come to the table and start grilling for you. When we were about to leave,  my boyfriend and I saw a mouse running from the kitchen to underneath the tables so beware...."]
['Kirin Ichiban was out of stock.\nKorean sides - not spicy, not my taste\nVarious cuts of beef - good, but not great.\nSake choices - not good\nService - okay']
['My friends and I had been looking for an all you can eat KBBQ place in Boston for a long time. We finally found Sura BBQ and decided to give it a try. It was a little on the pricey side $30 for lunch on a weekend but in my opinion it was well worth it. The quality of meat was very good and the speed of service was great as well. We all left feeling extremely satisfied and it is somewhere I would definitely recommend if you think you can handle this amount of meat!!']
["Finally! An AYCE KBBQ joint in Boston! I don't know why it's taken them this long to open one... everyone loves KBBQ so the market is definitely here.\n\nI'm not going to state the obvious, but I'll summarize in short - super affordable KBBQ with a variety of options including hot pot. Drinks are pretty inexpensive as well with the average beer costing $4.50 and bottle of sake around $13.\n\nUnlike other Korean restaurants, Sura lacks side dishes. They only give a small plate of kimchi, pickled radish, and steamed bean sprouts. Personally, I look forward to the side dishes so this was a bit disappointing. As for the kimchi, I'm sure they go through high volume each day but it tastes really bland, like it hasn't been fermented/pickled for long enough. \n\n- Steamed egg is good but a little bit watery in my opinion.\n- Tofu stew looks plain but it has a good base for broth. There are chunks of tofu so it looks more like soup instead of stew. \n\nGet squid/calamari, baby octopus, short ribs, and marinated bulgogi!! Go for meat that are marinated as they'll have more flavor. I imagine the non-marinated ones will be good for hot pot, though. \n\nAlso- They give salads (with dressing) instead of lettuce so if you want plain lettuce to wrap, you have to ask for it. There are no vents so you're guaranteed to leave smelling like MEAT.\n\nAll-in-all, this place is decent but does anyone really expect super high quality for AYCE places? Prob not, so yeah, I would come back."]
["I love Korean BBQ so coming here for AYCE was great. The marinated meats are definitely better than the regular meats (duh), and they had a good variety of non-grill items as part of the AYCE such as dumplings, steamed egg, scallion pancake. I think the quality was good enough for a buffet. No major issues with the service, it was a Sunday night when they weren't busy though. I came with a large group of friends so we ordered a pitcher of fruity/berry soju - delicious!\n\nWill bring my family here next time!"]
['This is so far far away from where I am and it\'s not yummy enough for me to make that trip again. Unless my friend drives me ok: \n\nSo wanted to try AYCE korean bbq, because - duh AYCE. So I was very hype for this. \nThe cool thing is they have PURPLE RICE. It\'s PURPLE! How awesome. It taste pretty good, kind of like wild rice (which I adore) so (+)!\nThe meat overall is like "good" but not like "OMFB good". Course B with the higher price, have some of the better stuff like, like I\'m not here to waste my stomach space for chicken! Beef tongue was good, short ribs are good. Pork belly, good. But the favoring isn\'t intense enough. Like I want to die eating AYCE Korean BBQ. But hey I\'m still alive and I\'m sad it\'s not as amazing as I want it to be. \n\nThe juice they have is only ok. It\'s not very yummy to me but the poor girl keep on asking me to try it and really really wanted me to like it. And I\'m like "yay it\'s good haha..." \nOh and they really want you to like their food. The servers are all very nice and accommodating.  But still not amazingly yummy food I was looking for. \n\nI\'ll try to overdose on Korean BBQ elsewhere ~']
["Having lunch at Sura is good.  Everything looked\\tasted good until we ordered the beef short ribs. It looked like it's been in the refrigerator too long. We ask for another plate and it was the same.  Waitress said it's because it's marinated (uh.... OK).   I know how fresh marinated beef should look like and not like the ones on the plate in the pic here.  \n\nThe LA short ribs on the grille is also marinated and it's fresh. Look how red it is.\n\nOverall, place is good but it gets stars deducted for trying to serve not fresh meat.\n\nEdit: the brown on the pic on the grille is just the cooked juices between the meat."]
["This place was originally a Korean bbq restaurant but it looks like they're under new management and offer BBQ BUFFET now, prepare yourself for a meat fest!! \nFor $30 a person, is it bang for your buck? It really could be, just make sure you arrive with an empty stomach ready to chow down on densely flavored beef spare ribs, delicious melt in your mouth pork belly, tender squid, and some good old bulgogi. The meat in general here is very well marinated, we even gave the chicken a try and it was so heavily marinated that you almost couldn't tell it was chicken.  Everything is also very fresh and did not have any chewy meat whatsoever, very decent cuts of meat.  Even the squid was perfectly thick and tender.  \nAt first I really missed all of the traditional side dishes that come with Korean meals, no fish tofu :( But there are actually sides you can order as part of the buffet, like the tofu stew,  steamed egg, and rice of course.  That's when I realized it's actually better this way so you're not getting stuffed with these fillers, more room to keep the meat coming! \nMust tries from this place: pork belly, esp the black pig pork belly, it just becomes nice thick cuts of delicious bacon essentially, with just the right amount of fat, beef spare ribs, and the squid.  \nWith Korean bbq not being super common in Boston, this place is so worth a visit whether you're a huge fan of korean bbq or just trying it out, it won't dent the wallet that bad.  It has a very homey and authentic feel inside.  Plus the staff is very attentive and friendly, we were greeted upon arrival and leaving, orders taken quickly, and our grill was consistently changed."]
['The best barbecue around!!!! I cannot get enough of it!! The staff are awesome including jason the restaurant manager. Everything is delicious there especially calamari short rib and intestine!!!']
['From the menu that requires an engineering degree to understand to the host/waiter responding to my question if an item was included in the option I was considering with "yes, I told you already didn\'t I" to another waiter questioning our menu selection with "are you sure you want that much", if anyone\'s seen the Seinfeld Soup Nazi episode then this is the place for you. \n\nEverything was lacking in flavor -- the meats, the soup, and even the fruit smoothie we ordered. We were also expecting those assorted tiny dishes of preserved veggies you get before Korean BBQ, and instead we got giant platefuls of bland kimchi and lettuce. \n\nAll you can eat of this quality and service is not worth it, and honestly it hurts to say this, but the previous Korean place that was in the same location, with its surly staff, served much much better food.\n\nUpdate - Saw the restaurant\'s business manager replied; just wanted to add it\'s kind of funny because he\'s the one who responded to our menu question with "I told you already".']
["The worst Korean BBQ I have in US. The hot plate is sweet with no hot sauce, Steam egg is undercook, BBQ too sweet. The waiter took forever to find the dish on their menu, forgot our dishes for 30mins, can't explain what kind of meat it is. No one explain how to cook, no one help control the fire until we found they are burned."]
['I would say this kbbq place is a very solid 3. Warning: pretty long review lol skip to the bottom for input on food/service/ambiance. \n\nDefinitely the only "good" korean barbecue you can get in the greater Boston area since there are not many Korean restaurants around here (if I\'m mistaken and there are other good kbbq joints out there PLEASE LEMME KNOW!!) \n\nHowever, coming from an area back at home with many Korean restaurants, this place seemed very average to me. \n\nFrom my understanding there are two menu\'s you can choose from, the A course or the B course. The B list has a wider selection and what most people would consider the "good" stuff for a few dollars extra. I believe it\'s around $30 per person, and to be honest I\'m not a fan of all you can eat places to begin with because I get full very quick and feel like I can\'t eat my money\'s worth lol. I wouldn\'t come here unless I was REALLY craving some kbbq. \n\nThe food - the meat is pretty good for an AYCE place, a lot of AYCE BBQ places have very average meat just because of the quantity of meat people eat at these places. I was pretty disappointed in the lack/quality of side dishes. \n\nThe service - the service has been subpar every time I\'ve come. The Korean servers are usually not the most friendly, and then the non-Korean servers do not seem to really know the menu. \n\n**ALSO** we have never had servers who flipped the meat on the grill for us. I know this doesn\'t sound like it should be a big deal, we can obviously flip the meat fine ourselves, but it is A HUGE THING across all Korean BBQ places for the servers to be the ones flipping the meat instead of the customers. \n\nI was particularly disappointed last visit because we did not get our waters until a good 10 min after we sat and AFTER we got our first round of food. I think it\'s basic server etiquette to bring out the waters first thing. We had to ask for our egg-jjeem twice. We also ordered mushrooms and they just never ended up coming out. I do believe/hope the server was new at the job, so we did not complain. \n\nThe ambiance - I really like the restaurant, it is so much bigger/spacious than most restaurants in Boston/greater Boston area. There are many booths to sit at and a separate room for bigger parties as well. It allows for more privacy when having conversation, which I like. \n\nOnce this place steps up the service big time, it\'ll be a much better experience eating here. It also has potential to become very popular as it is one of the few Korean BBQ places somewhat near the city.']
['Preface: I went on a Saturday of their soft opening week, so I am hoping that the next time I go here, I can give them a 5 star review. \n\nALL YOU CAN EAT KOREAN BBQ IS FINALLY IN BOSTON! (well Medford, but close enough)\n\nThe good:\n-All you can eat meat for less than $30 (Definitely go for the Set B $29)\n-Great service by the manager (?). Super friendly and helpful, even when he was busy (and also helpful over the phone)\n-The quality of the meat and the options you have \n-Some exciting menu items that you wouldn\'t see at most restaurants. I haven\'t had gopchang for over a decade and I finally got to eat it here!\n-The decorations! It reminded me of being back in Korea. There were a lot of nice little touches that reminded me of a Korean home or Korean restaurants.\n\nThe not so good (hopefully will improve upon):\n-The grills. We were seated at a table with one of the "old" grills and it wasn\'t lighting properly. Which would not have been a big deal, except they were too busy to help out with lighting some times.\n-Some of the servers. One of the servers was clearly upset that we were ordering another round of meat (4 rounds of meat for 6 people, isn\'t that crazy, is it?). She rolled her eyes and then stopped responding to us while taking order. Maybe I\'m a bit sensitive and maybe my friends and I eat a lot, but that was kind of off putting. \n-Staffing and organization. I think they need few more servers, everyone was super busy. I didn\'t even blame them for forgetting some of our orders or for not telling us about why some items were never brought out. I think they should have dedicated servers for each section to make it easier for the servers and the patrons. Wait time was pretty long, but I understand that\'s why they\'re doing a long soft-opening test run.\n-I think some of the menu items (especially the ones on the set B menu) were out, which was disappointing because we paid the extra money to try them. \n-Lack of side dishes. Even though I look forward to side dishes at Korean restaurants, I understand that it\'s not their specialty (since it\'s all about the meat here)\n-Some of the marinaded meat was not very flavorful (bulgogi and galbi maybe needed to be marinaded longer or with a stronger sauce?)\n-Some of the extra items on the menu (steamed egg dish and korean miso soup) were disappointing. Egg dish was too watery and the soup was lacking in flavor.\n-Vents would be nice, but let\'s be honest, I don\'t mind smelling like KBBQ for the rest of the day\n\nAlthough this time I was not impressed, I do plan on going back because the quality and the value of the food was good for an all you can eat KBBQ. \n\nPS. If you\'re going there in the near future, make sure to be nice to the staff, it seemed that they were all working hard and was struggling with the large number of customers that they had to deal with. Remember that they just opened this location and might need some time to work out the issues.']
["Came to Sura for the first time (since Chung Ki Wa) with a group of 10 for dinner. Here's a run down of our experience.\n\nGood: Our service was great. The owner and waitstaff were friendly, helpful and responsive.  Our grills were changed often and we got all the proper accompanying items for BBQ, including garlic, peppers, sesame oil, lettuce wraps, ssamjang and doenjang.  The meat selection was decent and seasoned correctly...the dwaejji bulgolgi and LA Galbi was perfect. Our lettuce wraps were never empty and our servings always came out quickly. The seafood (we got squid and shrimp) was very fresh and sweet. The Soju punch and soju were tasty.\n\nBad: Some of the appetizers, like the pajeon (scallion pancake) were a little lackluster.  The mandu didn't seem homemade and had a filing that was so so at best.  Seeing that you wouldn't come to a Korean BBQ buffet for the appetizers, the quality of them was easy to forgive. The Banchan wasn't extensive, but the staples were there and in good portions. I would not recommend the straight up rib eye, as it comes frozen hot pot style. There are many other good choices for meat.\n\nOverall, this is your standard Kbbq all you can eat restaurant. I just came back from Korea (born there), and no it's not as good as a five star joint in Seoul, but it's not supposed to be.  For the price you pay, it's more than acceptable.  Good experience and I would come back. Thanks, Sura for finally providing Boston with an AYCE Kbbq option!"]
['Aight, here\'s the run down.\n\nI like this place a lot! Granted, my friends and I came on a non super busy day and arrived relatively early prior to prime dining time. Simply, this place is similar to a lot of other KBBQ AYCE places I\'ve been to in LA. They have option A menu and option B menu. Both have different selection of meats, option A is a cheaper option and option B are more "premium" options in addition to everything in option A. The meats we got were not too bad. Though, I didn\'t have a cut that blew my mind, it was good for a place that is AYCE. \n\nNow the things that I\'d recommend for them is to get some sort of ventilation for the stations, oil the grills a bit, and to double check the bathrooms every so often! It had rain a day or so prior to us arriving, and the ceiling in their bathrooms had leaked quite a bit, to the point where their air vent had dropped into the toilet. \n\nTL;DR: I\'ll be back.']
["A co-worker recommended this place a few months back, but I was reluctant to go since I generally associate AYCE restaurants with quantity not quality.  Plus I typically don't eat enough to justify an AYCE bill.\n\nAfter a recent trip to New York, however, I couldn't stop thinking about Korean BBQ and a quick Yelp search led me to SURA.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and would probably return to fulfill my frequent Korean BBQ cravings. \n\nOnto the food!  The menu is basically broken up into two categories: A course ($25.95) and B course ($28.95).  It's a no brainer to splurge the extra $3 and opt for B course.  Why?  Spicy  black  pork  belly!  And also L.A. short ribs. \n\nWe ordered a bunch of other stuff, but honestly everything else is a waste of tummy space.  I rated this place 4 stars based on the spicy black pork belly alone.\n\nOf note, I was looking forward to their ginger cappuccino and house made lemonade that I saw on a few Yelp pictures, however, their espresso machine was down and the lemonade was no where to be found.  Boo.  Oh well, next time.\n\nEdit:  it's a full house on a weekend night, so definitely come early or plan on waiting.  The grill also doesn't get as hot, since all the grills are going at once, so the meats take a lot longer to cook.  Still yummy though, just prepare to be patient."]
['Overall, decent place. Good portions, although it gets hot really quick in there. Be prepared to leave smelling like BBQ and oil.']
["Yessssss SURA has come to Boston. My friends and I used to drive an hour to Rhode Island and back to have their Korean BBQ. The AYCE is very fairly priced at $25.95 and includes several meat choices as well as a variety of appetizer and side dishes. \n\nThe food is delicious and the service is great! This is hands down the best Korean BBQ in the Boston area now, especially if you aren't looking to blow $50-60/pp at some of the higher prices places.\n\nWe went on the second day of their soft opening and the place was already very busy so I guess word gets around fast. Go try it sooner rather later because I bet there will be a wait pretty soon on weekends."]
['Nice place, Busy on Sunday nights. Service is awesome! If it looks like your struggling making the food, they will come and cut if for you! Dim area but great place to go eat with friends and family!']
["I love Korean BBQ but I wouldn't return to this place. The meat is very bland and the service is slow even though we were the only table at the time. We never got our waters refilled until the dinner shift servers came in. The only good thing is they have unlimited sides. I love kimchi and I can never get enough of it. Other than that I wouldn't return to this place even though it's all you can eat."]
['Bit pricey if you come as a group. However fast service and great food. Recommend the pork belly, seafood, and the marinated meats, including the chicken. very tasty. Also the jigae or soft tofu soup was good for buffet.\n\nScallion pancake, dumplings and other regular side-dishes were not that special.']
["I went to Korean BBQ in japan. I was so sad when I couldn't find a restaurant in MA! Then I visited my boyfriend in L.A. And they had kbbq in Korea town. Hey, LA is better than having to go all the way to Japan... but now my heart rejoices, for there is kbbq within walking distance!!\n\nFor anyone who doesn't know what this is, it is like hot pot except with a grill instead of broth. For anyone who doesn't know what hot pot is.. I don't know what to tell you. It is like hibachi except YOU ARE THE CHEF! And if you don't know what hibachi is, google. \n\nVery friendly service, delicious Korean condiments. The meat variety is good. Obviously, upgrade to the B menu. It is only 3 more dollars and there are even more choices of meat!!\n\nMy favs include bulgogi, brisket, and spicy pork belly. \n\nWOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"]
['Excellent quality bbq! A touch pricier compared to the neighbouring restaurants, but it would be a mistake not to come to sura and the quality of the meats more than justifies what are actually very reasonable prices. Great service and i highly recommend the ginger espresso.']
['I liked it - had a Sura hot plate. There is some waiting for a table (I came in late) and I think salad prep/washing could be better BUT Sura hot plate was delicious and every single one of the servers displayed extreme kindness.\n\nPlus you could watch the NBA finals on multiple screens.\n\nGood times and looking forward to eating the leftovers for lunch.\n\nWould consider the all you can eat menu for a celebration...\n\nand this place was open late, whereas many other nearby eateries were closed by the time I came out looking for food.']
["If you want peace and serenity, I recommend heading over before the 5 pm dinner rush. If you want to experience smog, then come during peak service as this happens when all the grills are on and there is no ventilation. I hope they invest in better ventilation because when we went during their grand opening and all of the grill was on, it was very unpleasant. But other than this, we've been back and enjoy our experiences each time. \n\nI highly suggest beating the dinner crowd for the best service. The waiters actually have time to tell you what each meat is on the plate, offer you help to cook and  cut the food, and refill your drinks and take orders. \n\nHere are my favorites: \n\nA choice:\nThin marinated beef\nThin pork belly \nPurple rice (this is why I love this place) \nSteamed egg\nSoft tofu stew\nVegetables: onion, zucchini squash, eggplant \n\nB choice:\nShort ribs \nLA short ribs\nSpicy marinated black pork belly\nBlack pork belly \nMarinated Bulgogi and squid \nShrimp \nBeef tongue \n\nThe owner is very proud of his ginger cappuccino and rightfully so. It is my favorite drink. You should mix it up. While I am not sure if it goes with Korean BBQ, but I love me some coffee especially in the summer time. I would go with Sapporo for the BBQ."]
["Do: \nOrder off the AYCE B menu\nOrder the spicy black pork belly, LA short rib, prime brisket\nCommunicate with your server - they seem to like to help you a lot with the cooking part (usually I like to do it myself, so just speak up but be polite)\nSneakily turn up the heat (three different employees told us we were cooking the beef too long but the grill wouldn't get hot enough to have a good sear on the outside and pink middle so you have to choose one or the other)\n\nDon't:\nOrder shrimp - it was not good. No marinade and mealy texture, possibly old or at least probably frozen\nOrder the soft tofu - it was okay but not really worth it\n\nNotes:\nGood service overall but probably 5 different people came over to our table so better coordination would be good\n\nOverall: \nI live nearby and it's not a bad price so I would go back"]
['As a frequent patron of Sura BBQ, I used to come here twice a month. I had only positive things to say about this restaurant and wanted to share my love for it amongst groups of friends. For the price, you get a lot of bang for your buck going with the BBQ option "B". The portions aren\'t very large, but for All-You-Can-Eat that doesn\'t really matter, as long as you have an attentive waiter. The spicy black pork belly and beef tongue is a personal favorite. I never understood the negative Yelp reviews of this place until it finally happened to me:\n\nWhenever we came to the restaurant it would usually be Friday or Saturday evenings around 7pm (prime time). Needless to say, that\'s when the restaurant is packed and there\'s a lot of staff working so service wasn\'t really an issue. However; when deciding to eat there on Sunday at 8:30pm, the restaurant was half empty and only a small portion of staff seemed to be working. At 9pm we waited 25 minutes with absolutely no service. Our grill was starting to smell really burnt and nobody came over to change the grill (usually during prime time they\'re very good about that). The staff were walking around the other half of the dining room setting up the plates for the next day, but were not attending to us. At this point it\'s almost 9:30 so the restaurant is practically closed and they finally come over to tell us "it\'s last call. Would you like to order anything?" and we were obviously upset because what\'s the point of all-you-can-eat if you didn\'t let us order? So we asked for the bill and left it at that. The waitress was nice enough to at least apologize for the lack of service and sent over a manager. This is where matters went from bad to worse. The manager put on a phony smile and claimed "Dude I was just here to flip your meat!" and we\'re looking at our burnt grill and empty glasses "what meat? are u kidding?" Instead of acknowledging their mistakes (which could have been easily diffused) he was insistent that we were given lots of service and nobody did anything wrong. At this point we just wanted to leave since it was disrespectful to be accused of lying about the lack of service. You can\'t accuse a patron of lying and then offer them "but you can order more meat now if you want since I\'m now here.". That wasn\'t the point. I\'ve always been a very reasonable person so I wasn\'t trying to be mean, cheap, or get a free meal; but if you give me bad service or accuse me of lying I expect you to do your job as the manager and remedy the situation. I do not appreciate a manager shouting "WELL WHAT DO YOU WANT THEN? WHAT WILL MAKE YOU HAPPY?" It\'s not my job to tell you how to do your job. I know you don\'t need my business to survive as your restaurant is constantly busy but I think it\'s the principle of the matter.\n\nThe nice thing should have been: "I\'m sorry that we forgot to tend to you guys tonight while we are setting up for tomorrow. I know you guys come here all the time so thank you for choosing us. Is there anything I can get you?" That\'s all it takes. Your waitress was nice enough to do so, you could learn something from her.']
["Reason why I'm a fan? You rarely get owners come and greet you and take care of you like this one. The owner of Sura was filled with energy and super friendly. That's how you handle a business!\nThe food is very good simply because its an all you can eat Korean BBQ! The tofu soup is amazing and to die for! We kept ordering and they kept coming! Service was impeccable."]
['The only beef they have are WAY WAY WAY WAY WAY too sweettttttt\nBut the staffs are good']
['This is a mediocre Korean restaurant that does not taste authentic.  For the price, there seem to be a lot of choices and the quality of the meat is not poor. But the serving portions for the meat are unnecessarily big so you probably will be unable to enjoy many different types of meat. The meats, particularly the\n galbi and the pork belly, have an unhealthy amount of fat that we just cut off most of it prior to grilling. \nThe grill itself is very weak and not suited for an AYCE bbq restaurant. It takes a really long while for the grill to heat up but even then it is not hot enough. Also the waitress that served my table dumped a whole plate of meat on my grill before it was even warm. \nThe non-meat dishes that are included in the AYCE were below average. The soup dishes tasted horribly of some chemical. As a native Korean, the food here is simply not worth it even if you are able to eat 30$ + worth of food. Service was fine']
["Came here looking for Korean BBQ and unfortunately it was for one person. This place made it so that it wasn't an issue and I was quickly seated despite a busy Friday night. The servers were attentive and they made sure that things were served quickly. A gentleman in glasses was very helpful in making sure that the meat was cut and cooking correctly for me. And all this while the place was packed! Kudos for being attentive to the diners! Had a great range of types of meat and veggies. Did I mention it was an all you can eat!? I will be coming back here despite the one hour drive to this place!"]
['2nd try months later... +star for their watermelon smoothie...lol']
["I recently tried this place out after being denied hotpot (because I had it the day before and I am a hotpot fieeeeend). Anyways, we decided to check this place out. They have two options of the menu - Course A or Course B - and the difference is just the selection of meats. Course A is included in Course B. We decided to just simple and try Course A because there were already many options on that menu. We got an assortment of meat, 6 dumplings and 2 white rice. Everything came out quickly. Meat was flavorful and by the end of the meal, I was full. Btw, the dumplings were very juicy! After gandering the menu, I noticed there's hotpot so I may just be back for some hotpot lovin'."]
['Service was very good. Authentic tasty all you can eat Korean BBQ. Highly recommended. Will go back again']
["Food was mediocre. Service was horrible. Not one smile from our waitress. All the meat was thrown on one plate like they were serving pigs. Gyu Kaku would have been a lot better choice. Don't waste your money here. I had four people eating lunch on a Sunday and the bill came to $143 without ordering drinks or alcohol. For the money that we spend, atmosphere and service wise, was not worth it."]
["Korean BBQ restaurants are a great place to eat lots of food (and I mean LOTS) so I've been to a couple here and there. I was excited to go to my first kbbq on the east coast but I was pretty disappointed. \n\nMy friends and I were seated pretty quickly, given it was dinner time and busy. However, when we were seated, we waited around 10 minutes for someone to take our orders down...even made eye contact with one of the waiters but still nothing.\n\nWhen our food arrived, we were given a majority of the meat we ordered but was still missing the other half of what we requested. We had to remind our waiter about the plate of veggies we were waiting on. \n\nWhile grilling the meat and veggies, I realized that the food was sticking to the grill. Of all the kbbq restaurants I've been to, oil was always placed on the grill...maybe it's an east coast thing??? I was expecting to have more starter plates/appetizers; not just a plate of kimchi, pickled veggies, and 5 leaves (which they consider a salad). On top of that, I was disappointed when we were not given any rice paper, which is like, the staple of any kbbq meal. The quality of the meat was okay (definitely not worth the $25~$30 price). We also ordered the steamed egg and tofu stew but it tasted a bit unauthentic and was an unexpectedly small amount. In the end, we ordered dessert which was quite tasty!\n\nAs for the design of the restaurant, there were only few air vents placed on the ceiling, but keep in mind there's about 20 tables all grilling some food; so it made the restaurant a bit smoky, at times.\n\nOverall, my tummy was filled and satisfied, but it will most likely be the first and last visit."]
["I know this place just opened in Boston and is getting some hype, but meh I'm going to say it.\n\nService was really slow. Maybe it's because I went a couple days ago and it's in the first week of opening, but I don't understand how the workers weren't prepared for that. Constantly asking for water, to change the grill, to remind them of our previous orders. It was stressful to eat. Leads to indigestion.\n\nFood wise... As a Korean, I thought the food was okay? Not bad, but definitely not great. Both my Korean and non Korean friends agreed. All of the marinated meats tasted like it was missing one or two ingredients, almost bland. The sides we ordered tasted absolutely not like what you get at other Korean restaurants! \n\nI made a couple tips but I'll reiterate- the dwenjang jigae tasted like chicken soup with Tabasco sauce in it. Like that vinegar taste. The soon dubu- oh my just no no no. How does it taste like spicy watery tomato soup? The steamed egg? It's not like the fluffy kind you get at every other place, it was flat.\n\nBUT the non marinated meats are great! Because you can't go wrong with plain meat.\n\nSo overall, 2 stars, sorry! Compared to the many all you can eat Korean bbq places in NJ and NY, this not the place to get hyped up about. It's only because Boston is behind in the game. But while I am in the area, I'd much rather go to a non all you can eat bbq restaurant so that I get exactly what I expect with faster service."]
["I like it, \nafter the remodel. New owner, friendly, attentive staff, great choice of meats, etc and tasted well. \n\nOnly items for improvement: \n\n1. Bathrooms need an infant changing table\n2. Music needs to be quieted down a bit, ppl start to shout over each other \n3. Scallion pancake needs more scallions. Hardly any on there, only tasted floury dough. Offer kimchi or vegetable pancake and you'll be good to go!\n\nBottom line. Happy we went, next time we come with the whole crew. As we used to. Definitely a great group dinner place!"]
["1. ALL YOU CAN EAT YAY!\n2. Pick between concourse A $25.95, and concourse B $28.95.\n3. I would choose concourse B, since its only three dollars more and it includes so much more. \n4. Not many side dishes as usual\n5. Service was extremely slow. (Letting it go because it is a rather new place, I believe.) \n\nI've only known of at most two other all you can eat Korean BBQ around the area, and I have to admit this is the best one out of the other two. There was a huge selection of meats available and other sides such as steamed eggs, and tofu soup which were both very good. \n\nOut of all the meats my favorites (that you should order first) are the briskets, LA short rib, thick sliced pork belly. \n\nThe meats that weren't so good were the, beef tongue (too small) and octopus (would never fully cook for us). \n\nI will definitely be back here again with friends, or my boyfriend and would definitely recommend this place to others."]
["This is an all you can eat Korean bbq, and I went in knowing quality wouldn't be spectacular so I wasn't that disappointed. There are two sets, one had the basic Korean bbq meat staples like bulgogi, and the second set includes the first plus the premium items like kalbi, pork belly, seafood, etc. I think if you're going to do this ayce, might as well go for the premium set. The marinated kalbi to me was my least favorite which sucked since that's usually my favorite thing to order at Korean bbq, but I found the spicy pork belly to be really good! It was good flavor, good heat, and performed well on the grill getting nicely charred and caramelized. Service is really good for an ayce and they are super nice."]
['I love it here, it was my 6th time eating there so I decided to try the shabu shabu and it is just as delicious as the BBQ.']
['Came here a few weeks ago , and the quality of the meat was phenomenal! Highly recommend the course B just so you can get the short ribs! Will be coming back!']
["Disappointment. Flavor was a miss.. boyfriend said he'd rather i have spent money buying ingredients and making it. Thats saying something cause i hardly cook. \n\nmost of the side dishes seemed like they had been sitting out. We had been poorly attended to..\n\nMost of the food wasn't seasoned properly if at all..  we ordered rib eye and it definitely was not rib eye..\n\nThe waitress almost dropped the grill onto the table which could have hit me or my boyfriend \n\nThey brought us the wrong rice\n\nThere is definitely more than enough to improve on.. won't be returning any time"]
["Nice addition to the Korean food scene in Boston.  While the meats aren't the best grade they have a good variety.  The service can be slow due to understaffing but overall they are friendly and try their best.  I'm giving them the full 5 in hopes that this trend improves."]
["This place is definitely worth the money. Food was delicious. I actually got pretty full before I could try everything I wanted. I'll definitely be back.\n\nMy only complaint is that the service is a little too much. We didn't have one server approach us, we had like 6. They approached us one after another after another after another. Constantly asking the same questions over and over and over. I understand that they were probably trying to be attentive but it was literally too much and got really annoying. I was trying to have a conversation with my friend but could rarely finish a sentence before a new server would approach the table, interrupt and ask the same question that the previous server just asked us three seconds ago. It was a Thursday night and the restaurant was half empty but I felt like they were rushing us. We weren't even done eating when they brought us our check..."]
["Not the worst place ever but not the best place. With all the hype, I was expecting something really good since some people have said they've drove 2 hours to RI for the main restaurant down there, but with my experience at this location, it was a disappointment. I have to commend the restaurant on their attempt with good service even though the place was super busy and we had a large party on a busy Friday night.  The manager came by several times to make sure we were enjoying the food, help us grill/cut the meat as did many other servers/waiters/waitresses, which was highly appreciated and noted with my family. \n\nSince they are just opening, there are certainly a few kinks for them to work out.  \n1) The lack of prices.  The ordering menu for the bbq are sheets of paper on the table which is cool, but we didn't see the prices of each set.  I only know of the price based off from reading other reviews on yelp.  I could possibly have also missed the prices because when we were seated, we did not have the hard plastic menus which I saw some of the waiters grabbed for other tables.  This really came into play when we ordered dessert. The quality of the dessert was great, but we didn't know that dessert was an additional charge nor did we know the price of the desserts, so that was a good amount also tacked onto our bill that I would have liked to know previously when we ordered. \n\n2) The lack of communication/the amount of miscommunication.  It was great that the food was brought out quite quickly, but they did miss some of the items were ordered. Also the menu does not provide detailed description of the meats and the waiters do not tell you what did they bring it. Everything is mixed on one big platter.  This isn't a huge issue, but it's helpful for when you want to know what you ordered and what did you like so that you can re-order.  It was also a little bit hard to flag down a waiter to get water (we just ended up running out of water and not getting any refills), but it's not like they purposely ignored us; all the whole staff was clearly quite swamped with work.\n\n3) Quality of the food. Having previously experienced korean bbq in other places, I had came to this restaurant with hopes of having similar experiences. The biggest shock was when the food first came out and it looked like to me the meat was the same thing as what you get at shabu shabu/hot pot. With previous experiences, I thought it would be thicker cuts of meat like I had experienced previously with other kbbq places.  This ties back with the lack of communication; if I had known before I went to the restaurant my expectations would be different. Don't get me wrong, they do have GREAT cuts of pork belly and certain cuts of beef (which I could not identify clearly to what the names were).  The seafood was also delicious and they give you a whole big squid/octopus.\n \nBut I have to say...definitely do not get the beef intestine.  I am not squeamish at heart; I do love trying new things and have had different cuts of bodily parts of many different animals which I have enjoyed immensely, but these beef intestines weren't what I was expecting.  I have to question if the insides were cleaned properly because when eating them, I felt like throwing up and my mom who often prepares intestines at home, have said if they are not cleaned properly and thoroughly it will be a nasty experience to eat.  The intestines had weird gritty stuff coming out plus they didn't look appealing.\n\nOverall, this place didn't live up to expectations but understandably it's just only starting out. They have good service which is quite rare these days.  Sura has a lot of work it needs to improve on.  I'm not sure if I will be up to coming back anytime soon, but we will see what happens."]
['The all you can eat Korean BBQ was absolutely amazing! We had a company dinner here last night, we all got the "B" option and I must say the ribs and bulgogi were awesome, if I come back, I just want to order these 2 all night long. Jason did a great job taking care of our group of 10 (esp since only 2 of us had been to Korean BBQ before). Also, you must try their home made soju pitcher!']
["Finally...an AYCE korean BBQ so close to home...great meat choices...would be nice if japchae was on AYCE menu...not many korean restaurant I've been to have gyeranjjim(steamed egg) but this one does and purple rice too...we'll be back soon..."]
["I came to Sura several months ago, shortly after it opened. I had a wonderful meal and gave it 5 stars in my review.  But I looked at some recent reviews. Most are still 4 stars but some are very low ratings, 3 or even 2 stars. I decided to go back to see if this place has slipped.\n\nThe owner greeted us with a friendly smile and handshake as soon as we entered the restaurant.  We were seated at a spacious table for 8, since I had brought some friends who had not tried AYCE Korean BBQ food.  Water and salads were brought immediately by friendly wait staff.  After we ordered our food, it was mere minutes before food started arriving to fill our table, and this was on a Saturday night, at the height of their dinner rush.  During the course of the dinner, our water and drinks were refilled, clean grills were exchanged for our grills which were getting a bit charred, and the waiters came over to help cut and cook our meats without being asked.  We ordered additional items several times and they were always brought quickly to us with a smile.  So I don't know how anyone can fault the service.  As I said, it was a busy dinner rush, but I could see that every waiter was rushing around to take care of the customers at the best of his ability and still do it with a smile, and I could not ask for more than that.\n\nThe quality of the food remains unchanged, which is to say that the cuts of meat were tender and delicious, the paijan pancakes were crisp and yummy, and the seafood tofu soup (which all comes with the AYCE price) was almost worth the price of admission alone.  I've seen some reviewers who compare this place to top notch Korean AYCE BBQ places in Korea, and found Sura to be slightly inferior, and this seems totally reasonable to me.  I would be surprised if they thought Sura was better than the best places in Korea.  But I've seen other reviews that say the cuts of meat were very sub-par, the seasoning was totally lacking, etc.  Some of these reviews even direct you to try other places nearby.  Honest, I can only guess that Sura is doing very well and killing the competition, and owners of competing restaurants have felt the need to come on Yelp and bash Sura so that they might steal some of their business back.  \n\nPersonally, I enjoy great restaurants wherever I find them in the Boston area.  Sura provides a very enjoyable dining experience.  If you're a person who enjoys delicious Korean BBQ meals at an AYCE price, then Sura is a fine place to try."]
['Super digging this place. Attentive, caring staff. Relaxing atmosphere. Amazing food! We got the spicy pork hot plate and the beef hot plate - great presentation, they mix the dish in front of you. Comes with a few sides and this super creamy egg soup situation. All for somewhere shy of 15 bucks? I accept. \n\nNot nuts about the maudlin, super American, acoustic cover music but whatever.']
["Great price for what you get the all you can eat kbbq and hot pot. Friendly service and definitely get your money's worth. Definitely plan to go back when I'm north of Boston."]
['Great people, nice workers\nFresh food, reasonable price\nOne of the best in this area\nMe and my friends really enjoyed food\nAnd will def come back']
["We live in Boston and there aren't many AYCE Korean BBQ restaurants around so we decided to try Sura in Medford. It was worth the trip, and worth the money! We love this place - services are amazing, food are great. Overall we had a really great experience. Definitely will recommend this place to my friends and we definitely will be back. One of the best AYCE in Boston so far!!!"]
["I made a reservation at 1 PM on Sunday 5-14-2017 6pm for mothers day dinner. I got there at 5:30pm and the guy who works at the front said he never got my reservation, even I showed him the number i called and he said it is the right number. Then i am like i don't care about what table just give us a table. And then when we tried to order, they won't allow us order more than 5 items which is stupid. I been to the one in RI so many time and there is no such rules. Me and my girlfriend wanted to throw up after we ate, food is bad. We felt like we had food poisoning! Would not go back again!"]
["I'm here right now, and it's closed? Very confused, Yelp said its opened and I didn't see any operational hours posted at the restaurant. My commute was 40 minutes. Bummers; I was excited to try this place out\n\nUpdate -\n\nI ended up trying the restaurant out and let me tell you, the service I received was phenomenal! The food was OK, and I totally understand the restaurant business model. We waited for about 30mins for a party of 5, however we were able to purchase alcohol during our wait. Cheers to the management at Sura! 3 star jump!"]
["Finally a korean bbq buffet in the metro-boston area!  there are so many other types of buffet, this is the type of buffet boston has been missing for many years.  the place used to be another korean restaurant that closed earlier this year.  it's convenient that they don't have to renovate or make any changes b/c all the amenities were already existing when they bought the restaurant.  in fact, the place still got the old sign and pictures of the food the old place used to sell.\n\nthe food's awesome, lots of meat choices eat till you pass out.  the price is 26 pp or 30.  the pricier one gets you more food choices.  i think most people would opt for the 30 one since it's just a few bucks more.  you get to grill your own meat but occasionally the wait staff would come over and help you out.  service is friendly and pretty good. \n\nthis is a great place to go if you're a big time meat lover.  there are a few vegetable options, they don't give alot of veges (perhaps people don't eat that in korean bbqs?!).  some of the dishes are overly sweet for my taste but i think it's just me.  i wished they had more cooked and side dishes.  also i think for 30, dessert should be included but i didn't see any menu other than the meats menu.  no drink menu was presented but i saw that they have liquor and soft beverages.  not that i care much for drinks since i came here for the meat, but i think it's important for other customers.  kids 3 and under eat for free.  anyway, a great place and i am glad to finally have this gem in my hood!"]
['大家一定要看过来！\n\n我来这里吃是看到龙虾君说这里开张了。想到这家主店在罗德岛（Rhode Island )有二十几年的历史,我打着10星的满怀激动开车冲了过来。\n\n好，进店的第一感觉就是很旧很脏。整个格调都很暗，和yelp上的那些照片差得很远，貌似那些都是店主ps后上传的。而且我们桌子的颜色是棺材红，有一点压抑。不过想想就算了，只要好吃就行。毕竟老板是正了八景的东北人，我对你有信心！\n\n我们第一波点了 牛舌，五花肉, 短肋骨，LA短肋骨，茄子，还有一些蔬菜。过了几分钟我们的肉来了。服务生一来把火一开把肉一倒，扔了把剪刀就跑路了。好吧，你们忙我理解。。。不过刚开张不多雇用几个服务生老板你也真够省的。\n说说味道吧。牛舌是冷冻的，直接拿机器片了后端上来，没味道。哦，对了，店里送了腐乳酱和酱油。我实在不爱吃.....\n\n五花肉，分量大，超市里一条五花肉切成了3个长条。没腌制过。哎。。。除了肉的油腻味没别的了。\n断肋骨，味道完全不对，只有甜味。和Korean garden 或者纽约的烧烤乐园完全没得比。\n茄子，用的是长条茄子，切了4片3-4毫米厚的，然后告诉我们茄子卖光了。好吧我理解。\n\n\n好吧吃完了，烤的铁盘也糊了，服务生不会主动换的。喊了半天来了人换了。换完就跑了，excuse me?我们桌子上没菜了...哎嘛。。。。好吧，等了老半天没人来点菜也没加水我们跑到收银那喊人....\n\n之后点了些其他肉也没法吃，不过尼玛最气人的是服务员为了收盘子没经过我们的同意直接把盘子里没腌制的生鱿鱼扔到我们快烤熟的肉上了。那个腥啊 。。。本来肉就难吃，这下...我就擦了............\n\n不过毕竟这是中国人开的店，给点老乡人情分，要不就给1星了。\n\n3 星吧！\n\n\n回到家，狂拉肚子。。。。。。好吧。 那就2星巴，，，，']
["This place is amazing! Incredibly helpful staff that will help the novice out with what to do with the bbq grill and how to eat what. The food is great quality, freshest kimchi I've ever had and the bibimbap is super delicious. I haven't had anything i didn't like there yet. Having just moved to Medford square area, we hope to become regulars!"]
["Our party of 7 had a really great time here tonight. Fantastic korean bbq and amazing service. Course B is worth the extra money! I also don't think I've ever had better service than I have tonight - they were constantly attending to our needs. Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back."]
["I really liked this place when it was Chung Ki Wa and was sad it closed but found out it actually just went under new management and is now an AYCE BBQ place I was excited to go back and try! The meat quality definitely went down as it's now AYCE, but can't complain too much for the price point. Just about $30 for a pretty large selection of marinated meats and sides. Even though I've moved out of the area, I'll definitely make the troop back from time to time!"]
["I'm updating my review because Jason (the manager) has gone above and beyond my expectations each time I came back! The service with the servers has gotten sooo much better. Even though we got sat on a table that had some issues with the fire, the rest of the experience made us forget that was even a problem."]
["I believe this place recently opened. Wide selection of meats and other sides. Meats are very plentiful. Marinade could be better, but hey, you can complain with all you can eat Korean BBQ. Staff is very friendly. The owners' are very nice and even help with the staff. Wait time for meats were minimal. They offer to cook, but since I've had my fair share of open grills and hot pots, we abstained that service and cooked our meats ourselves. The side soup, pancake-like dish, and egg were plentiful as well. Their alcohol is fairly priced as any typical Korean restaurant. Their 2 hour rule regarding all you can eat wasn't enforced that we stayed maybe 2.5-3 hours and had our fill of food."]
["If you are a meat eater and enjoy Korean BBQ, this is the place for you. Don't fill up on rice or too many apps. Excellent!"]
["This was our first time here - heard rave reviews for RI however this was definitely not the case for this location. :( :(\n\nDefinitely could be more organized - there were at least 2-waiters and 2-managers supposedly.  and they were all running amuck all over - no organization.  Supposedly the limit is 2-hours however with the very slow service in waiting for everything - we were there for at least almost  3-hours (got there around 7:30pm left at 9:45pm.) and it was not that we were eating or lounging - we were mainly waiting for the food and the waiter.\n\nWe were a table of 5-ppl and we tried to order at least 2-orders of the meats - the waiter said that the food would accommodate for the # of ppl.  which was not the case.  And he also stated that we can't order more as it would be a waste of food.  HELLO - we just got here and we're hungry so why wouldn't we want to eat.  So we listened and only ordered 5-meat items and boy it was a BIG MISTAKE.  By the time the waiter came around to us to order again - it was at least 45-mins and we were starved so we didn't care what he said and ordered majority of the meats from 1-20 and YES we ate it all and got more as well.  \n\nMEATS - not too bad but on the sweet side.  BEST was the Marinated Thin Beef, Rib Eye.\nVEGETABLES - Ordered the eggplant, potatoes, squash, mushrooms - all thinly sliced but it was not for 5-ppl that was for sure.  2-sliced potatoes,  3-sliced squash, and 6-sliced eggplants and mushrooms.  now how is that for 5-ppl.  :(\nSTEWS - beware definitely on the spicy side but good.\nSTEAMED EGG - not bad a bit watered down and salty but again not bad.\nPURPLE RICE - basically healthier white rice and very very bland.\nWAITSTAFF - very forgetful and slow.  We asked for forks &amp; knives - only got 1, extra napkins - never got.  kept asking to refill the water.\n\nFunny part of it at about 9:30ish (since it was also less diners and the kitchen closed) - the waiter comes by and starts cooking our meats and states that someone should've been cooking &amp; cutting for us.  Well that wasn't on us. :( :(\n\nWe were full but not from the food but mainly from waiting.\nit really depends if we'll be back."]
['Even when it was Chung Ki Wah, it was at best a 3 star restaurant.  Service was decent but food wasn\'t mind blowing and I\'m not sitting here craving for more.  Ventilation was never great so you expected coming out of the place smelling like bbq from head to toe.  So now it\'s changed management and become an "All You Can Eat" bbq joint.  Truthfully not much has changed.  The signs on the restaurant still have Chung Ki Wah, the furniture and tables are recycled, and even some of the waitresses are familiar looking. Here\'s a breakdown of pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n1) Free parking in the back of the restaurant.  \n2) Can accommodate big parties because they have a private room which is honestly why we always default to this place especially if you have lots of kids. \n3) For $28.95, the quality of meat is not bad.  I personally can\'t eat enough to justify the cost of any buffet but they offer rib eye and pork belly which is better than your average meats.  \n4) They also offer dumplings, pancake, tofu stew, etc and other appetizers as part of the AYCE menu. \n5) Service was good and the servers were quick to remove dishes off the table and change the grill.\n\nCons:\n1) I\'m not a big sodium fan so it wasn\'t too big of a deal for me but if you\'re looking for salty marinated meat, I\'m sorry to say it will disappoint because most of it was bland and not very flavorful. \n2) You will smell like bbq and grease. \n3) They use to have sushi which surprisingly wasn\'t bad but this is no longer on the menu.\n4) They don\'t have hard alcohol like Captain Morgan which they did in the past. \n5) They use to offer Yakuit as a dessert when you requested for the bill. Sadly you just get your bill now. \n6) Only two hours to eat.\n\nI can\'t say the experience was bad but it wasn\'t anything to rave about.']
['This is the best Korean BBQ restaurant I tried in boston. The meat is very tasty, and try the desserts. The price is very reasonable .']
["Not worth the money.......  They use same Chinese artificial flavoring for everthing; soup, meat, side dishes, etc. I go to a lot of all you can eat places but this was the worst experience I've ever had from an all you can eat restaurant. Way too expensive for low quality meat and everything taste the same because of whatever chemical they are using."]
['Knowing the place was all you can eat, the expectation is that you can eat lots of alright tasting korean barbecue. In that regard, Sura was exactly what I thought it would be.']
['The food and service are okay. The marinated meat is too sweet. I hope they could lessen the sweetness of it. The sweetness overpowers the taste of the meat. I hope they would improve the next time I come. This is my experience.']
["Sura was a big part of my high school memories when I was in Rhode Island. I'm shocked to find out that they just opened another restaurant here at Medford. \n \nPros:\nGreat food quality! Everything is pretty on point and certainly better than Korean Garden in Cambridge.\n\nThe restaurant is a lot more spacious than the one is Johnston... And cleaner! \n\nReasonable price. For AYCE it's only about $30 and you have a lot of selections.\n\nThe bathroom is clean. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, they have a gender neutral bathroom available. I don't see this much in other restaurants. This is not only convenient for transgender people, but also moms who need breastfeeding. Way to go Sura!! Very thoughtful.\n\nCons:\nWith a restaurant big like this, they clearly don't have enough servers. I came on a Friday night, and things got a little chaotic. The restaurant owner and everyone else were running. And yet we still didn't get enough attention. We waited for a long time to be seated even though there's tons of empty seats available. Waited even longer to be asked for our orders. This place certainly needs a lot of management and trainings for their employees. Maybe they could separate areas for different servers and each person is responsible for a particular area only. Having people running around is not only inefficient, but also dangerous when they have hot grills and stuff. Some of the Chinese servers are having a hard time communicating with their customers...  It's absolutely fine not knowing English well, but at least get familiar with what's on the menu. The person in charge of the checks is pretty unorganized as well... There's definitely a better way organizing different checks than laying everything on the surface. \n\nSince it's probably unrealistic to wait for the servers to cook the meat for you, you are on your own... which is totally fine for me. However, a lot of people don't know what they are doing... And that becomes a huge problem. One of the tables actually had bright fire appearing at their grill. Tons of smoke came out from their table and made the restaurant pretty foggy. Unlike the one in Johnston, they don't have the vent above your grill to suck up all the smoke. So when there are people who don't know what they are doing and servers are not on their top of games... You will find yourself surrounded by smoke.\n\nI'm writing such a long review because I really loved Sura in Johnston. I just hope the owner can get things together soon and make it as good as the one is Johnston if not better."]
['Amazing service delicious food just found out about them a month ago and I have been there 4 times']
['Fast service with a big smile - food is delicious you cannot go wrong with any order. They serve BBQ meats with some unusual side deishes all so very good -  bring your hungry masses! Spacious with plenty of seating!']
['The food and service are good. It will be even better if you have taped beer. A good choice near Medford.']
['Perfect food and perfect services! \nEspecially the tallest guy!\nLove all sura restaurants, no matter in Rhode Island or Massachusetts.']
['Will never come back to the restaurant because the tall leading waiter\'s temper and service is unbelievable bad! \nWe were asked to wait for a 7-people table for a while. However, after 30 minutes waiting, we realized that the table was already empty but no one took care of us. We complained to the waiter, but he somehow got mad and shouted to us: " YOU CHOOSE TO WAIT, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND YOU HAVE NO CHOICE!" We never say loudly to him, but what he did totally shocked us. So disappointed!']
["First Ayce korean bbq in the area.  The food was okay.  Price is decent but I don't  enjoy the way they cook the meat.   It would be better if they would have separate utensils for cooking raw meat. I fear of cross contamination  between  the raw and cook meat each time the server help us with the cooking."]
["Came here on a Wednesday and it wasn't even packed. Sat at our table for literally 15 mins before someone came to serve us. After he served us nobody ever came back to give us another round. The food is great, but the service is terrible.  Manager and staff are friendly, but that doesn't make up for the service. Nobody came to checked up on us for a good 15 minutes. Within an hour me and my friend only had one round of food. If you want service go Gyu~Kaku...you get more for the money your paying! At least hire more servers please..."]
["My husband and I have been here a couple of times and we love it!  We know what to order, the pricing is reasonable and the staff is always welcoming.  It's nice to be greeted so warmly when you walk in the door and that's what happens here. Being a Medford resident, I want to see good quality restaurants/stores in our neighborhood and Sura fits the bill!"]
["Wow a new opened Korean all you can eat place in Boston area. I was very happy when I heard from my friend that sura finally opened their location in Medford MA and tonight I was eating with a group of friends. It was really crowded at the beginning we were afraid of the waiting time but surprisingly the wait staffs are so fast to give us a big table. We had the soju punch and lychee sake it was very testy and we had course B which you will get 29 choices of meat. The side dishes are just kimchi and some bean sprouts bit I'm ok with it since I want to eat more meat. The LA short ribs and pork belly oh my you can never get enough of it. I also enjoyed the pancake and soft tofu stews. Over all staffs are wonderful and very friendly and the food for all you can eat is great. I mean for 29 dollars basically you are just paying 1 dollar for each meat. We had really good time dining at sura tonight I'll def tell my friends about this place and I'll def come back and eat at sura again. They even told us thank you for coming. I was like thank you for having. Lol."]
['very delicious! all you can eat Korea bbq. very cheap in Boston. the waiters are very friendly and the atmosphere is very warm. I will recommend to my friends. \nthe beef short rib, black pork belly, steam egg........very good']
['It appears that the restaurant is understaffed and the quality of the food is poor. They also gave very little food at one time. Probably never going back to this place again.']
["Everything was under seasoned and expensive...$270 for a party of six with THEIR tip included.  The service was terrible.  We got food that we didn't order, asked the waitstaff for the steam eggs 5x (and still never got it), had to get up and get the staff just to get a fork and service.  And we sat so long just waiting and waiting for food or service.  Place WAS NOT busy!   NEVER EVER Coming back!"]
["Attention: Sura BBQ Manager\n\nI'm going to write my honest opinion about this restaurant so please bear with me.  The price itself for AYCE Korean BBQ is extremely reasonable.  The meat itself wasn't bad either, but not the best, of course frozen and probably bought  a bulk of meat in advance, however it is also like that in most of the restaurants as well.  To be more specific, it is with Asian bbq joints, Allston and Brookline Area, Korean Garden, Myung Dong, and Gyu Kaku.  I had the A course and it was extremely delicious.  Freshly fried dumplings and scallion pan cakes had a spectacular texture.  The spicy tofu and bean paste were also delightful and refreshing, perfect amount as well. My biggest problem was your side dishes and steam eggs.  As soon as I sat down, my side dishes came out within 20 seconds, which means they were probably already put into dishes and left outside, possibly open in the kitchen, but I don't want to make any assumptions. Furthermore, it did not have enough side dishes such as garlic, peppers, lettuce wrap, etc. Secondly, the steam egg was extremely watery, which means either the ratio of water and stirred eggs were not quite accurate or the temperature that they cooked the eggs were not right or the eggs were already stirred and then poured inside the container for awhile.\n\nI tried everything on Course A, but the beef intestine and chicken courses.  Thinly sliced pork belly was mediocre at its best, you can buy the cheapest quality of pork belly and thinly slice them and still taste good if you cut it thin and slice properly.  Spicy pork was marinated perfectly, but the bulgogi was bit on the sweet and watery.  I don't really care about the vent system that people are complaining because I like that smokiness in the air filled with bbq smoke.  If you customers are complaining about vent system and air filled with smoke then you might as well just go dine at Davios or Rialto.  Wake up, this is a bbq joint.\n\nThe service was spectacular.  A mid-aged gentleman with jeans was extremely professional and personable, I believe he was.  My waiter was very quick with ordering food as well!  I come back to restaurants for the service and warm hospitality, not always for the food.  Since the food itself was good , I would come back again.  One more thing, why don't you empower other employees to take orders as well.  They are just wondering around when customers want to order more food.  It takes longer for some these employers to get the manager and the old Lady to take orders for them.\n\nI will come back again!  Thank you for your consideration and service."]
["Pretty solid rendition of Korean BBQ, complete with the sides, jjigae, and heavy marinade for cheaper/older cuts of meat. I do wish that some of the unseasoned meats were of slightly higher quality (fresh and not frozen; or more marbled) but it's pretty decent already, so long as it's cooked correctly. The grills are also a bit small-- if you have a group of four, plan on spending more time getting full (don't try to walk in just before closing). You can request specific items that aren't necessarily on the menu, such as garlic, or plain lettuce for wraps. The Korean staff (presumably the owners) are quite friendly and responsive; the others less so."]
['food was good for a buffet but i felt rushed all the time. the manager kept coming up to the table constantly to ask if we are all set ordering. literally constantly while me and my gf was eating.']
['Worst waiters compared to other 2 in RI. Party of 7 checked in and waited for the only table for 8 like centuries. And some manager face told us you have to wait and don\'t be "mad". Boy you don\'t tell a group of people don\'t be mad while you ignore them all the time. And learn to apologize.']
['I went with my friend yesterday after reading 4star reviews on Yelp. which is what I normally do before I decided to go somewhere. There is a man who wears regular clothing seated us down. i think might be a owner/manager must be someone in charge there. I told him up front that it was our first time there. I ordered a hot green tea. He gave me a green tea powder(i think its for smoothies or latte) mixed in a cup of water which I drank anyway. $3 each cup.  My friend ordered 5 items(4 kinds of meats, one veggie). Then the guy told us we can only order 5 meat on round 1. So which I thought I can order another kind of meat that I like since my friend ordered 4 of them. The guy was a little intimidated. and says "I told you, you can order 5 items" . Oh well, i wish he can explain how the buffet works before we order i did tell him it was our first there. then i said fine leave one menu behind please. Hes like "lady, look at your table, you have one right there!" not in a very nice tone. so he grabbed the two menus and left. The small piece of menu under my plate sets. well, didn\'t see that sorry. It was dark inside. The total price was $68 for two people, we had only the first round and left the place. we tipped 15%.    The food is not so good. If you are new to Korean BBQ you might like it. Its non-comparable to other Japanese/Korean BBQ place I been to. The marinated meat is just okay. Its good for meat lovers who doesn\'t care much about the taste. The only thing I am glad that we paid about $78 so I don\'t have to come with my family to try again.  good luck!']
["I was told this is a famous Korean Bbq from RI. Wanted to try for a while, finally got a chance to go with friend's birthday party. It turned out to a nightmare. Service was good, the young waiter and waitress are nice and know everything. They help you to cut meat, change grill. The other two old man, one looks like boss, both are rude and ignore your request. And the food and meat are horrible. This is the worst meat I ever seen in any Korean BBQ, I would buy ready to cook meat in hmart. After 30 minutes eating, I got cold sweat, dizziness and nausea, then I almost vomit, lucky they have a clean restroom, I had diarrhea. I might be food poisoning. After that I dare not to touch any food or water in this restaurant. To me, it ruined my friend's birthday party. I definitely will not visit them again. It only for people with strong stomach. Thanks god, I am still alive to finish this review."]
["The place is understaffed for now. Everybody was in a hurry. Nobody offered a water refill during our visit. We went on a Friday night and there is a line waiting. While we are eating, a table somehow overcooked the meat and smoke instantly filled the place up. The food was ok. Apparently course B would be a much better choice if it's ur first time there."]
['Very good food there, good services, everything is perfect there. If u want to spend time with friends, there has very tasty and fresh food for u! Always recommend sura to all of u guys!']
['Do not come here on holidays if you have more than 4 people in the party! They will have tables serving six or more closed for business. Friends get together here for lunch from four different cities on the 4th and we were told we have to split up into to tables because they have a row of big tables closed for today! How disappointed it is!']
["It's the first Korean BBQ in Boston! Servers are very friendly and patient, even in very busy time. Compare to other buffet, Sura is the best option! I highly recommend LA beef short rib and spicy pork belly, and they have dessert and ice cream after dinner. Must try!!!"]

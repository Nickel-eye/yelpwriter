["Mmmpphhhh I love Chipotle. And I love this Chipotle. I especially love this Chipotle because it's not crowded on Friday during lunch, which is when I tend to go. Everything else in Davis is hopping around then, but not this place - I can be in and out in about a minute.\n\nAlso, I don't know if portion size is inversely proportional to how busy they are, or something, but I've never had a portion issue here. In fact, I tend to get can't-fit-in-burrito portions without even trying to do or order anything special, so that's nice. \n\nWord of warning, though: you know how there was that burrito comic floating around the internet about how making burritos the incorrect way may prompt certain connoisseurs of Tex-Mex fare into a murderous rage? Yeah, well... the staff here definitely have never seen that comic, or just don't care. I also don't care, because my burritos always tend to fall apart and I have to eat them with a fork anyway, but I'm down with that. If you're not, well, maybe this isn't the place for you. Sorry."]
['Dear Chipotle Customer Services:\n\nWhen I went to pick up an online order, I asked politely if I could use my samsung smartphone to pay---which I\'ve had success before at this location. The clerk (20s female) looked quite annoyed and said "we don\'t have that", followed by "is it an iphone?" (it\'s not). I tried to explain that the back of the phone(NFC/MST) can talk to the card swiping part of her register, but the said clerk just became more annoyed: "how am I supposed to swipe with your phone?". Well, not with that attitude, you can\'t. So I paid with my credit card instead, no problemo. But why the hostility over this simple request? To be clear, it\'s *not* a favor I\'m asking from you, it\'s *you* being lousy at your job of taking my money.\n\nThere was no apologies of any kind. Guess I will just have to order my lunch elsewhere in the future to avoid annoying your fragile and incompetent staff.\n \nSincerely yours,']
['This location is notorious for skimping on ingredients. Even beans and rice??? Everyone knows overfilling beans and rice is the easy way to save money and give us less meat. Come on.']
["I love Chipotle. It's fast and it's filling. I guess my only gripe is that they only have forks out for the customers. You have to ask the cashier for spoons or knives. It's a bit pricey for what you're getting but then again it's Davis Square and everything's that way."]
["Cheap meal, but it's also not a lot of food. My portions are much larger at other Chipotles in the area.\n\nI'm giving 2 stars because it's cheap and the food is like other Chipotles. I'm giving another star because once I asked to use the server's phone charger so I could give a friend a call and she kindly unplugged her phone so I could revive mine."]
["I had never had a bad Chipotle experience - until this time - and I have been going for years. First of all, staff were more focused on their own conversations than paying attention to customers. Secondly, they tried to charge me $2 extra for having my sour cream and salsa on the side (been doing this for years and never had a problem). Then, the staff at the cash register was argumentative with me tried to tell me that\nI was the one who was wrong and that they were considered 'side items'. Rude people really irks me. \n\nOverall, I had a terrible experience. Poor customer service. Just moved to the Davis Square area and was hoping to make this my go-to Chipotle spot but I will have to frequent another location. I have been to many Chipotle locations across the U.S. and had always been impressed with the customer service (Chipotle usually excels) and that is why I had to write this review to describe my disappointing experience."]
["Location is perfect.\nIt's so delicious!\nMy recommend is steak or carnitas burrito. Or bowl.\nWe can choose some stuffs in many kind of it."]
['When debating where to hang out with my paramour, I think, "my place where it\'s clean, quiet, comfortable, and spacious, or his place, which is across the street from Chipotle?"  Chipotle wins more times than it probably should.  The food is wonderful--portions are great and my burrito is always hot and overflowing with messy faux-Mexican goodness.  The service is fantastic; I hardly ever have to wait in line and the servers are very friendly.']
["It's chipotle, whatcha want? \n\nIt's always the same. \n\nIt's always cheap. \n\nThe pork with white rice, black beans, salsa, hot sauce and a bit of sour cream served in a bowl hits it every time.\n\nYup, I go here too frequently"]
["Holy shiet.\nDoesn't get much better than Chipotle.\n\nOkay, so the burrito bowl is hands down the best thing here.\nHowever the burrito itself packs more calories, so if you're looking to gain weight or something then this is the item for you.\n\nI'd also recommend the kids meal, even though it is somewhat smaller. You get rice, a taco (soft), chips, beans and a drink, all for $4.01 (with tax). I think it's a pretty good deal frankly.\n\nPrices are good and people are nice. If you go at night sometimes they'll give you free stuff."]
['The music loud enough that my toddler can squeal with delight or horror and no one stares, the food is fresh &amp; good, the prices totally reasonable, and the service is helpful, polite and prompt. Not sure I want anything else in a weekday date night with my 2 year old.']
["Their bowls are half as full as they should be.. And when we tried to redeem our free meal from the sofritas deal, they wouldn't include the guac with it even though another chipotle included it. Mad stingy up in here! Also can get pretty busy here so the servers can be pretty rude."]
["Move along people nothing to see here... My steak burrito was lukewarm and generally unimpressive. What really turned me off was the fat on the steak. I know you can't expect all the steak to be fat free but the amount of fatty unchewable steak in my burrito was disgusting.  I couldn't even make it through half of my burrito. Yuck.."]
['The food is good, not excellent. Where this place really wins is in its ability to handle allergies. As far as I know, there is no other restaurant of its type that you can go to and not suffer from food allergies.']
['I came to Chipotle with high hopes and I can\'t honestly complain about the food. I don\'t usually opt for Mexican style but when I do the little things (dining area, service etc.) seem to matter to my review more as I am not qualified to knowledgeably critique this style of food. For one, the tables were all covered in food when I sat down which to me is gross and unacceptable. Food on one or two tables - okay but without a clean place to sit down after I spent $10 I am not likely to come back. Another thing that irritated me was I had a coupon for buy one - get one for a taco but the manager would not honor it as it was for "an order of tacos." If you have a coupon be sure to check before they make your food. The fact they have beer is cool. I really want to love this chain but this particular experience at this location was not pleasant for me.']
['Food was very good. 3 stars as I thought was a little costly for rice and veggie bowl. Another plus I did not bleed out my ass like Cartman from a South Park show said I would.']
['Was there again due to timing/proximity and is has actually gotten worse. Made mistakes on 2 of three orders, rude counter staff and the persistent gall to charge for minor extras has closed the book on this location.']
['I wanted to bring to your notice a "funny" incident that happened with me last week at the this Chipotle. I used to be a regular customer of Chipotle. I was served a burrito with HAIR in it and when I brought this to the notice of the employees, they all started smiling at each other and joking "you should shave and cut your hair". There was NO apology at all! Surely, they thought "hair in someone\'s food" is a funny concept. \n\nWhen I sent an email to the manager of the store (derodriguez@chipotle.com) informing all this, there was no follow up at all. I couldn\'t believe how disgusting these guys were given the fact that most restaurants value their customers a lot. That was the last ever time me or any of my family went to Chipotle. We don\'t need them in Boston anyway - there\'s BOLOCO, whose staff is much more friendlier and their burritos are awesome.']
["Deliciously Inconsistent!\n\nAs other reviewers have pointed out, this location gets a lot of turnover. As a result, you often don't get that meticulous consistency of portions and assembly that you might find with a more veteran crew. The Davis Square location is a bit more like the wild west of burrito making (which is appropriate, since Chipotle started in Denver).\n\nThe good news is this is a restaurant where everything is assembled right in front of you. If you don't get enough pinto beans, ask for more. It's your burrito. The staff here is always super friendly; they won't mind.\n\nAnd the flip side of that coin is that you might get way more meat, or better yet, guacamole, than the typical, franchise-approved serving. That's what makes coming here worth it. The one risk is the dreaded re-wrap, which mixes the ingredients up too much for my taste, and always loses some guac in the process. But it's a small risk, and one I'm willing to take."]
["While we LOVE Chipotle, we are not a fan of the Davis Square location. We have had bad service and were not treated witch kindness. We have never had any issues with substitutions other places, especially if we were paying for them, but they did not want to make any additions to the kids' meals. Our daughter likes corn on her quesadilla so we do that instead of meat usually. In Davis square they don't want to do it even if we're paying the extra money. Also, asked for extra sour cream and barely gave us any, so I asked for a side of it and they didn't even fill the cup 1/4 of the way. It was just weird that they didn't want to serve our family as paying customers should be served. The bathrooms also we note clean (neither women or men's rooms). There is no changing table which is a problem. And the food portions were small. Overall, not a great experience and doesn't live up to the chain's standards."]
['My husband went in to order me a side of steak with beans and cheese. First off they charged over $8 for 2 side items, stating the steak was considered a bowl on its own and the beans a side item WHY DON\'T BEANS COME IN THE BOWL I DIDN\'T WANT RICE FOR!? I figured whatever, for the money it must be good, it wasn\'t. The beans looked like a bowl of vomit and cheese with a lovely slime coating, they tasted bland and somehow spicy at the same time, and the uniformly cubed chunks of what loosely resembled meat tasted of nothing but hot sauce. I decided to just bring it back as the single bite I took of each item left my stomach rumbling and my mouth on fire. When I brought it back and told the counter staff that it was simply not to my liking, he started giving me an issue about me only returning it because of the price; NEWS FLASH if the price was the issue my husband simply would not have bought the swill and left, he then asked for the card my husband paid with, he paid in cash, then he asked for the receipt, he never received one, and I was given an attitude about presenting a receipt for a refund being part of their cash handling policy (this pimply kid had an attitude like his crap didn\'t stink the ENTIRE TIME), so I told him if that is their policy then they should also make it policy to hand them out with what they are calling food. The entire experience was just horrible from the initial interaction with my husband and then mine with the presumptuous counter help at the counter. I\'ll walk the extra block to Anna\'s AND risk the cross contamination affecting my celiac disease rather than bother with this joke of a "restaurant" EVER again. (the fact that I would rather risk cross contamination because of the language barrier to eat at Anna\'s should REALLY tell you something about how horrible this business is).']
['I think I\'ve been to a Chipotle before but I could be wrong. They blend with Qdoba and Boloco to me, and have nothing that creates their brand - much as "Welcome to Mooooooe\'s!" does for Moe\'s and a really kcuffing fast burrito does for Anna\'s Taqueria. P.S. I like run-ons, the sound of breaking glass and hockey. Two truths, one lie.\n \nSo, the wrap shack in Davis Square opened up and I decided to grab dinner there - partly because I had to eventually, partly to fuel my Davis list. Four patrons in and around, no real buzz and very industrial. The menu read like 1984 propaganda: EAT. MEAT. SALSA. SIDES. Even the bags of chips sitting under hot lamps had that generic "Other Guy" look. \n \nMoving on.\n \nI opted for a steak and chicken burrito. Black beans, cilantro rice, hot salsa, green tomatillo and a little cheese. She scooped the beans and caught a huge chunk of the neighboring peppers and onions in her spoon. Onions are the devil\'s food - unless fried or in salsa. Whatever. Onion haters understand. I asked if she could remove the offending produce and she acted like I asked her to toothbrush the tiles. The rest of the assembly line went smoothly. Hooray. \n \nSo, I paid and left and got home and ate the damn thing. Meat was overcooked, tortilla didn\'t stay together and in the 15 minutes from ordering to my belly, the cheese didn\'t even melt. I saw/felt/tasted potential in the meal, but this visit was less than fulfilling. That\'s what I get for cheating on Anna.']
['Big portions. \nLow prices.\nRelatively healthy for fast food. \nTheir tortilla chips are a fave. Hints of lime and not too salty. \nClean restaurant.  Staff were friendly enough.\nHard to say much more about fast food.']
["Yuck. Wow. I coulda had Anna's. I forgot it was 2 blocks down. That is all."]
["What can I say?  It's a Chipotle, but it's a consistently clean and efficient one.  Get the hardshell tacos--they're great."]
["I hate Chipotle.  They serve undercooked beef (RAW).\n\nThere is Anna's Taqueria a minute away - which is so much better and their guacamole is amazing."]
['The Facts:  Good fresh quality ingredients made in front of you.  I can dig.  Good flavors, cheap and straight forward gringo Mexican. I can dig that too. \n\nThe Catch: 1) If this were a review for a Chipotle not 3 doors down from Anna\'s Taqueria we\'d be writing a different story here.  Listen, this place ain\'t bad but as the explanation for 2 stars says "Meh. I\'ve experienced better".  2) I HATE predatory business expansion plans for up and coming chain joints, which Chipotle is doing by building a place basically next door to Anna\'s.  \n\nSupply the community with something they are lacking, and Davis sq isn\'t lacking great cheap fast Mexican.  I remember seeing dunkin donuts do this all the time when i was a kid and now there\'s almost no mom and pop donut shops around new England.  It\'s gonna suck if Davis Square looks like Harvard Square in 15 years.  Luckily Anna\'s has staying power and Chipotle will do fine because it is really good.  Two stars for the foul, Play nice up and coming chain restaurants!  I\'ll leave a 3 or 4 star review next time I visit a Chipotle filling a gap in availability in a different area, if everything is as good as the one in Davis.']
["My wife enjoys Chipotle more than Anna's Taqueria (blasphemy to me) but I admit their food is pretty good. \n\nI've tried a few burritos and they are just too much food for me to eat in one setting.  I got tacos last time and that was a much more manageable meal and is probably the way I'll go in the future.  \n\nAnd one thing I love about them.  When you order something hot, that's how you get it.  Be warned."]
['Love this Chipotle! Super yummy food in a great GREAT location in Harvard Sq!']
["Have to admit, it felt a bit weird to walk right by my beloved Anna's Taqueria and head into another burrito place.  But i was taking advantage of coupon for a free burrito, and at the same time finally getting to try a chain that i had heard good things about from several west coast-ers.\n\nThe ordering process was familiar (how many different ways can you setup a burrito place) but i definitely had some difficulty hearing the staff ask me if i wanted various items - i don't think i'm going deaf, so i'm going to say that they weren't talking loud enough.\n\nI went with a pork burrito (a departure from my usual) with my usual fixings.  I was impressed with the salsa quality - i generally don't go with much heat, and some mild/medium salsas don't offer much in terms of additional taste - this one did.\n\nThe place was clean, looked 'new', nothing that would stop be from coming here again (unless Anna's makes me feel guilty for betraying them)."]
['Alright so it feels a little pointless to review Chipotle (I feel like this review will be read by a total of 2 people. Maybe) but I really felt the need to share my love for this place. I\'ve been coming to this specific Chipotle for the past 3 years and ever since I tried their burrito bowl with chicken, i\'ve never had anything else. Granted, I\'m not a huge fan of burritos themselves. But for some reason, once the contents are presented to me in bowl form, I\'M IN LOVE.\n\nHere\'s the "recipe" for my routine bowl: Rice, grilled veggies, (no beans), chicken, mild salsa, a little medium salsa, corn, lettuce, a little cheese, and sometimes a dollop of guacamole (costs extra unfortunately). As an added touch, I like to squeeze some lemon juice on top (lemons are provided next to the utensils). It just feels like a healthy bowl of rice, veggies, chicken, and salsa- who can turn that down?\n\nAlso, one time I had to wait a little while longer because they just ran out of rice when it was my turn to order so I had to wait on a second batch. I started chatting with the guys working there, who are always really friendly, and then they gave me my bowl for free!!!! I probably waited like 3 minutes longer than usual. Not a bad trade off.']
['I use to work at chipotle at one point and the service I got here wasn\'t the best. The welcome was fine. The cashier was barely focused on me, she was a short African American girl with short hair, and she barely spoke to me. She was talking to her friend, tall girl with braids I believe. The Cashier asked me "chips or drinks" I said a drink and chips, while getting the food she still continued to speak and laugh with her friend. She than gave me my receipt and it was as she wanted to just take my food and leave. I waited for a couple seconds for my chips, but I knew she had to have forgotten. So I asked for them and she didn\'t even ring them in.. She started laughing with her friend that her friend was the distraction. The chips were also stale.... It was a sad visit. The "vision" is obviously not taught at every location.']
["I always have been a fan of chipotle. Fajita Carnita with plenty of salsa and sour cream has never disappointed me, and you always leave full. Other than that, it's a standard chipotle, with standard decorations, pricing, and options."]
['I\'m a fan. That\'s why I gave this place 4 stars.\n\nBut honestly, I\'m going to need some Chipotle-away after the meal we just got. \n\nI used the useless mobile application that Chipotle provides to "save time."\n\nFew things about it:\n\n1) When you get into Chipotle, it\'s awkward as fuck to just cut everyone in line and say "I ordered using your mobile application." So you just kind of hang around until the cashier asks you what the fuck you\'re doing hanging around. Then you have to awkwardly sashay into the line and pay. Stupid.\n\n2) I\'m not Clarissa. My name is Boris, so obviously getting Clarissa\'s food makes no sense. I\'m a guy. Clarissa probably isn\'t. C\'mon, at least double check because god knows I trusted you enough not to open up my food. Oh well.\n\n3) If you\'re going to say the mobile app saves you time - then MAKE IT SAVE YOU TIME - put in some sort of sign into the restaurant telling the customer what to do. Better yet... have the mobile app explain this to you right after you order.\n\nAll in all: 4 stars. But only because the chick working the counter is cute and the food is pretty addictive.']
['I always like Chipotle when I have to eat at a chain fast food place, the best thing about this place is there is never a line!']
['This review is about the service I received at the Davis Sq. Chipotle. Chelsea at the Davis Square Chipotle brightened my day. I was having a terrible day and everything was going wrong. I went to Chipotle and ordered rice and beans, only to realize that my wallet was missing. Before I could burst into tears, Chelsea offered me the meal for free. She must have known how down I was because she offered me a coupon for a future free meal. Chelsea gave me the lift I needed for a better day. I cannot tell you how much that meant to me.']
["Apparently the Chipotle gods heard my complaint, because I dropped in today and they gave me a GIANT cup just for water with no attitude or complaint.  \n\nCongratulations Chipotle Davis Sq. I'll stop cheating on you with other burrito joints, and you just got your 5th star back!"]
["Chipotle is consistent. I know that, no matter which Chipotle in Boston- nay, in the US- I step in to, my burrito will come out approximately the same. And, in my opinion, that burrito will also be delicious. This location lives up to that. The burritos and chips here are damn tasty.\n\nAs for this location, it's super convenient, being right in Davis Square, and the seating is well arranged. The staff is always friendly, and patient with people I've observed who are a little, erm, indecisive regarding their meals.\n\nDelicious food by friendly people at a reasonable price. Hard to go wrong, right?"]
['UPDATE (6/12):\n This locations has free wifi. I am not sure if it is Chipotle or if I am jacking it from another source, but I am sitting in Chipotle right now, typing this update!  Woot Woot!\n\nI am not sure whom I have to thank (the gods of texmex yummieness, perhaps?) but the Chipotle in Davis Square is the answer to my lunchtime (and mayyybe dinner time, too) prayers.\n\nI was a little nervous (ok, I was terrified) that there would be no Chipotle within range of my new home, but alas, only two T stops away, my burrito heaven has manifested itself in all of its deliciousness.\n\nAnd, it lives up to the Chipotle manifesto: fresh, delectable and that glowing feeling you get from eating at a company who supports family-farmed,  and agriculturally-sustainable practices,  while using only products from naturally-raised, added-hormone-free animals.\n\nSTEVE ELLS FOR PRESIDENT!']
["Chipotle is as good as it gets for fast food. Some locations are better than others and I love coming to the Davis location. Right in the middle of the square, you can sit outside on a nice day or up against the window facing the street and get some quick people watching in. The burritos are always topped off with ingredients and there is not usually a line on weekend afternoons. Menu is of course limited, but there is no reason to change. You can't beat the quality of their offerings! This location closes at 10pm. I wish they were open a little later to meet late night cravings!"]
["It is like any other Chipotle - food is consistently great, unlike Anna's down the street I now avoid. Staff is very friendly, always smiling, and line always moves very fast. Not something I can say about the hipster-hive down the street."]
["I was originally going to go with 5 stars based on the competition in the Davis Square area, but I guess in lieu of burritos everywhere I can only with good conscience go with 4.\n\nThat being said, I do so love this place!  The food is good, the people always make me smile and I can't ask for much more than that!  \n\n(Oh yes, they are also much cleaner than Anna's, I'd say nicer too but that goes without saying - it doesn't take much to be nicer than the peeps at Anna's.)"]
['Yup...I did it...I clicked it...5 stars. Not everyone is a fan of Chipotle, but to each their own. I love this place... the simplicity of the whole concept, its a wonderful thing. \n\nI\'ve tried other Chipotle\'s in the past, but I enjoy the one here because it\'s local...it\'s always fresh and busy! Already this week...I\'ve been twice. I don\'t think I can ever get bored of it. I order the same thing every time I come here:\n- 1 chicken bowl - rice only - with a little bit of every sauce on it - extra corn salsa (that stuff is good) - guac and chips on the side. \nI then pour on some tabasco ( love tabasco )  and mix throughly...tear open the chip bag for easy access, and dip away with guac and my bowl mixture. \n\nAt first you feel like its a bit overpriced, but then you realize, thats a lot of food...and I\'m determined to finish it! This particular location is always busy. I even came once on a Monday at about 11am...there was a line, crazy bananas! \n\nIf you have a high school ID (don\'t ask) you get a free drink...college ID doesn\'t work. I even argued with the guy at the cashier..."we don\'t get a discount for higher education?" I guess not...but I love you anyways Chipotle! If you ever need a chipotle eating partner...I\'m your guy!!\n\nOh and when I went tonight, we were approached by one of the workers who came to our table and took our empty bowls to throw away. And she asked if we needed anything else, like more chips or salsa...how nice!! Thats why I always tip in their bucket...great service here.']
["Good place to get a quick meal. It's better for take-out than eat-in; sometimes it's too crowded to get a seat. I wish they offered brown rice on the menu."]
["Solid...its the best way to describe this place. \n\nYou know what you are getting into each time you walk into this place.  Clean, good food, filling, reasonably priced.  Nothing that will blow your socks off but undeniably good.\n\nIts the McDonalds of burrito joints...MickeyD's was the its majority investor for a while (they made a killing!).\n\nTrivia Time: Chipotle serves more naturally raised meat than any other restaurant in the glorious U.S. of A.  Also, supposedly, none of the restaurants have freezers, microwave ovens, or can openers!"]
["I have never been to this place so finally decided to check it out. It was pretty damn good. I asked for the mild salsa on my veggie burrito, but it had such a kick to it that my mouth was on fire &amp; made my nose run. The make a pretty hefty burrito, so when you're hungry this is a place you should totally check out."]
["First and foremost, Chipotle makes tasty burritos, tacos and other treats.  That said, I have a couple of issues with them.\n\nOne is the price of their guacamole. To get just a small dollop on your burrito, it costs more than entire avocado - $2.  Their guac is delicious and far superior to that of my preferred burrito joint, Anna's Taqueria (Chipotle's lack of tomatoes in their guac seals it for me).  Just like a drug dealer, they get you hooked on the good stuff and then jack up the price.\n\nComplaint #2 - these Chipotle worshipers who claim that their place is far superior to all else, and competitor Qdoba is absolute shit.  This despite the fact that many of their menu items are nearly identical.  Chipotle is Ford and Qdoba is Mercury - a few subtle differences, but the nuts and bolts are largely the same.  Same tortillas, same rice, same (delicious) guacamole, same choices of salas including a corn-based one, same shredded cheese, very similar chicken (Chip's might be a tad spicier).\n\n99 times out of 100 I'm probably going to Anna's, but Chipotle makes a fine burrito as well - just a little overpriced and very similar to one I can get in Porter Square."]
["*see UPDATE at the end\n\nHow do I love thee?  Let me count the ways...\n\n1. great guac (even though it's $2 extra)\n\n2. friendly staff\n\n3. full-disclosure of ingredients - I asked if their tortillas were vegetarian, and she went to the back and showed me the label from the bag (yes they are).\n\n4. music - great choice of songs piped in\n\n5. friendly staff - I mention this again because they didn't vibe me for coming in twice in one day (long story)\n\nChipotle, I heart you.\n\nUPDATE: I recently received an email alert from American Rights at Work adding Chipotle to the list of restaurants who use products from growers with poor records on employee rights... So staff, atmosphere, taste = 5 stars, business practices = 1 star.\n\nI'm torn.  I've boycotted the place for now and I miss it."]
["The service here is super speedy and efficient and I love all of their food (esp since a lot of it is organic).  I always get the brown rice burrito bowls here, and they never fail to impress.  This is my go-to spot for the burrito bowls and salads.  I have to admit though if I wanta  real burrito I do still hit up anna's since it's cheaper and they will always put extra veggies, etc. in for me.  But being the organic food lover that I am, I'm impressed by the quality of Chipotle's ingredients."]
['Chipotle is, and probably always will be, my favorite burrito joint in the area.  Regardless of corporate affiliation, I base this on taste, cleanliness, and staff.  In all three of these areas, the Chipotle of Davis Square exceeds.\n\nFirst, the food taste is superior to all other area burrito/taco establishments.  The portions are larger for the same price, and the food is much more satisfying.  Second, the store is so remarkably clean; it amazes me.  And lastly, the staff is friendly; they speak english; and they provide you a service with a smile... very important.\n\nMy experiences at this particular Chipotle have been awesome, and I will be back time and time again.']
["I used to really like this place - the stuff in their burritos was consistent and good.\n\nBut I'm starting to find their burritos extremely salty.  Does anyone else have the same problem?"]
["I'm in general a non-enthusiastic but content chipotle fan, but it just doesn't seem as good when you're in Davis and Anna's is right down the street. Chipotle burritos are good, if sometimes overstuffed, and they've got a nice selection of options. The guac is pretty pricey, but that's true at a lot of places. If you're just looking for a standard chicken burrito, it'll satisfy and they'll give you a huge one.\n\nThat said, I only come here if I don't have cash and therefore couldn't go to Anna's down the street. I like carnitas in my burritos, and the carnitas at chipotle are a little bit boring. There's nothing specifically wrong with them, but they lack the flavor and extra little kick that you get out of ordering carnitas at most other burrito places.\n\nService, though, kicked this chipotle up from a 3 to a 4 - I don't remember her name, but there's a lady behind the register most days who never fails to brighten my day and slide a joke in with the food.\n\nAll in all, it's a reliable and good option - but if you're in Davis and don't mind paying with cash, Anna's beats them any day."]
["Yes they are a chain. They were AT ONE TIME partly owned by Mcdonald's. \n\nHowever, consider the following: \n\nA decent and cheap fast food burrito.\n\nExcellent vegetarian options. \n\nThey have some kind of ethical food policy. \n\nIced tea. Free refills. \n\nYou can sit outside.\n\nAnna's is way over rated."]
["ok, so people rave about this place, and perhaps if i were into more traditional spicy mexican food, i would too. But- going in here hopeful, I was disappointed to find that the only mild meat they had was pork (not a big fan) and that is not even so mild. Very generous size though, so i usually take some home. If i can i go elsewhere for a burrito, but if i'm right there, the pork one is ok. I just wish they had some milder choices."]
[".,....I've debated long and hard about yelping about a chain...would my fellow yelpers think less of me? negate my knowledge of classier and fancy joints because I happen to frequent this place almost as much as a I drink tequila? ..( anyway that's another review and story..) well i just moved back here after 20 years in Los Angeles, and i know my Mexican or Mexican ish.all of that is to say..the food is so fresh that I wonder if the chickens are in the back of the joint. I am always making mental notes of cleanliness..( did she just sweep the floor then come and make my salad without washing her hands? ) - nope they don't..and the employees seem to hold your breath...drum roll..\nlike their job.\n\ni should mention that I weigh about 114 on a good day and could sit on a couch eating burritos forever and i wouldn't gain a pound..and while i COULD eat a chicken bowl daily..i don't...i like a liil variety in my life..but for the price and the overall goodness..\n\nthis is the place..."]
['Two thumbs up on the food, and a thumbs down on the price.\n\nFirst and foremost chipotle has good burritos, but the price is just the ultimate turnoff. Almost $13 for one burrito, and a drink COME ON! I spend less than that at burger king. I mean really I can go to a restaurant  and get more for my money. Don\'t get my wrong my review will not solely reflect on the negative attributes of chipotle, but I do want people to know the truth. \n\nNow down to brass tax... If your looking for something quick to eat that will fill you fast, and your not prone to "sticker shock" I said go for it. I can\'t say I\'ve ever had a bad burrito it wouldn\'t be my first choice. \n\nThe good:\n-Fills you fast\n- Good for on the go\n- Great pita chips\n- Relaxed atmosphere \n\nThe bad: \n- Price\n- Price\n- and did I mention... The price!\n\nThe ugly: \n-$2 guacamole \n\n\nTry it!']
["Mostly good. Sometimes lacking consistency. Couple stale tortillas towards the end of the day. Couple small burritos left me hungry. Anna's is more authentic."]
["It's about time I spread some Chipotle education. First and foremost, the ingredients they use have always seemed fresher than Anna's to me and in my opinion the burritos taste better because of it. I also like the consistency, the burritos always taste the same. Another draw for me about Chipotle is that they try to use as many organic ingredients as possible, plus the majority of their meat is antibiotic and hormone free. The icing on the cake is that they have been steadily making a push to use as much produce from local farms as possible and use a lot of paper products made from recycled materials. Pretty good practices for a business in my opinion."]
['Cilantro!\n\nOkay, from there, I encourage you to draw your own conclusions. There is cilantro in pretty much everything (including the rice!). So if you like cilantro, yay! If not (like me), nay.\n\nBut not all was lost for this cilantro-un-appreciator. The staff was awesome! I took one look at the green rice and started heading for the door, when the woman offered to just whip up some cilantro-free rice for me. Thanks! She then went on to let me know that there was one salsa that lacked the green stuff, and that was the hottest one. I LOVE spicy food, so this totally worked in my favor.\n\nMy veggie burrito was huge and very good! Not the best burrito in town, but certainly filling and kind to your wallet at around $6.50.\n\nBonus points: Outdoor patio seating!']
["Let's just start off by saying. I LOVE CHIPOTLE. I'm a vegetarian, so for a burrito or bowl it's a measle $6.00. It's also a large portion, so it always lasts for two meals. \n\nThe last time I was in there, they were out of everything.. rice, bean, lettuce. So, I had to wait a little bit. It happens.\n\nMy other disappointment, and it's just with the north (i'm from the south).. no body knows about sweet tea. Chipotle sweet tea is awesome."]
["This place having the temerity to locate itself only two minutes away from my lovely home...Christ, the nerve. What bravado, what brawn, what insolence. Grrrrr.\n\nBastards. Making me go there constantly for its delicious, simple burritos. Yeah, I'll say it. It's as good as Anna's, or any other burrito place around Boston. Every ingredient is done well -- the meat, the peppers and onions, the salsa, the big and warm tortilla. Even the chips are done just right. Crispy and just a little salty, alongside the choice of several delicious salsas. If you're looking for something a little less heavy, just get the bowl of ingredients sans tortilla -- a lot less messy, too.\n\nAbout eight bucks for a tortilla and healthy serving of chips. The staff is incredibly pleasant, and service is accurate and quick. It's a comfortable, un-showy restaurant, with a prime outside area for Davis Square people-watching. \n\nAs far as chain restaurants go, I can't think of any better one. I'll certainly miss this place most of all when I vacate Davis in a month."]
['I love Chipotle and their burrito bowls! Fillings are tasty but not greasy. I opt for the burrito bowls (and not the full-on burrito) to save a few o a calories. Pretty good stuff for a chain.']
["I ate here once. It was free because I am a member of the BSC next door. It was worth the money.\n\nFOR THE LOVE OF GOD ANNA's is Friggin' almost next door, take the walk! Get the better, non chain Burrito that McDonald's didn't own.\n\np.s. they can't wrap a burrito worth a damn. It leaked all over, and broke open within the first 2 bites."]
['WOAH!!!\n\nWhat is with all the negative reviews here? Every time I\'ve visited this fine establishment, I have been greeted by sonrisas (thats smiles for you English speaking folk)! It may just be my devilish good looks, but I cant help but think that the crew members are genuinely happy to see me when i come in!\n\nThe line moves pretty quickly, and the burritistas (if Starbucks can make up words, so can I) are happy to make any substitutions or changes to the existing menu items. The meat is always fresh and flavorful, as are the other ingredients. My favorite thing there has to be the chili corn salsa. Its a delightfully sweet and spicy mix of corn, chili and cilantro. Gimmie 3 tacos, a diet coke (this location is still cervesa-license-pending), throw a in a fresh lime in it and I\'m good to go!\n\nIt may be a little more expensive then Annas, but I find it less greasy, and more flavorful.\n\nNow, I may not exactly be "Mexican" per se, nor have I ever really been to "Mexico," or had an actual "Mexican" meal... but I did take AP Spanish, so I feel pretty qualified to declare this authentic Mexican comida.*\n\n\n\n*Greg F. is actually in no way qualified to make claims such as this; however, Chipotle is still delicious.']
["Like another reviewer, I was sent a coupon for a free burrito from Chipotle in the mail, so I headed over to this location to redeem it.  Being a lover of Anna's and Tacos Luptia, I sometimes feel like getting a burrito anywhere else is a waste of money, because it just won't be as yummy.  \n\nBut I was pleasantly surprised by Chipotle.  All the ingredients in my and my man's burritos were really fresh...and the burritos themselves were huge.  I couldn't even finish mine, and I have a pretty decent appetite.  I mean, they weren't perfect-- I have to subtract 1/2 a star for the use of white rice, which I really don't like in Mexican food, and another 1/2 for the $1.75 charge to add guac-- but I can definitely see us coming back here.  The chips were fresh and crisp too, and came with a choice of 4 salsas (you have a choice for anything you get, burritos, tacos, etc).  All the salsas we tried were yummy, fresh, and quite different from each other.\n\nIt's a bit more expensive than other similar places, but you do get a lot of very fresh food...so it seems justifiable."]
['Chains! Whoo hoo! \n\nSadly, I\'m a big fan. I have had the other two burrito places in Davis--Anna\'s and Bolero, but I prefer Chipotle. \n\nIt\'s always consitent. I know exactly what I\'m getting. And I love all the salsas and load up on every one every time I go. \n\nThe manager was a ltitle harried once and was kind of a bitch to me. But then I\'ve only seen her the one time and so she hasn\'t soured my Chipotle lovin\' yet. \n\nOh, and it\'s in a good location for people watching if you sit at the window. Always a plus. Patio seating equals "a plus" too.']
['I know, living in Boston I am supposed to love Anna\'s but I never saw the appeal.\n\nI have been to Chipotle many times in Washington, DC and New York, so I was excited to discover them in Davis Square. They are probably my favourite chain fast food restaurant.\n\nTheir chicken fajita burrito with the hot salsa is just about perfect. Not crazy "I need an ambulance"-hot like the Jamaican beef at redbnes around the corner or boring "americanized bland"-hot like so many other folks\' salsa, but just right.']
["My cousin's friend apparently had fallen in love with the place back in CA and I had never heard of it back there; I just moved here from CA - WTF was I thinking!? Freagin cold weather but I say I've adjusted far better then the Bostonian's I work with...anyway\n\nChipotle is great! I love going here and always the Fajita Burrito with Spicy Chicken...I'm hungry...\n\nMost likely I'll head back this weekend. :0)"]
["HOLY CRAP I love me some Chipotle. I'm glad this place didn't open while I still lived off Highland Ave because I would have eaten here EVERYDAY. I have not had a Chipotle burrito in like half a decade - since I moved from DC. Even though its a chain, it seems like it never made it up to the northeast region. \nWhat does it mean when a giant chain (NOT owned by McD's anymore - thank you everyone for your messages!) is ten times better than Ana's Taqueria? It means that Ana's really does suck as badly as I've always said it does. I am generally not a fan of chain restaurants, and especially not of fast food. But for a quick delicious American style burrito with tasty ingredients and non-scary meat (GET THE PORK) you can't beat this place.\n\nOther good stuff:\nGiant bottles and good variety of hot sauce (admittedly, I couldn't even taste my burrito because it was drowned in tabasco, but thats the way I like it!)\nCrushed mini ice in the fountain sodas - soooo good to crunch on!\nNot yet, but soon THEY WILL SERVE BEER! \n\nGoodbye Ana's, Boloco &amp; Qdoba FOREVER!!!"]
["I like Chipotle, I really do.  But not this one.\n\n- rude service: check\n- clueless service: check\n- out of product: check\n- out of drinks: check\n\nThe server didn't know what Salsa Verde was.  Really, my boyfriend couldn't have been the first to call it that.  Also, how is any restaurant out of food at 6pm on a Saturday (and not busy)?"]
['The burritos are gross and overpriced.\n\nThe guacamole is so salty there is no flavor and you just want a big glass of water to wash the taste away.\n\nThe tacos, on the other hand, are amazing! They are spicy, flavorful, fresh, crunchy, and as customizable as the burrito. Unlike the burrito, the tacos are actually a reasonable meal for one person.']
["At first I was annoyed yet another chain was coming into Davis. But I had to check them out and was pleasantly surprised. I expected to hate it. I didn't. This has now totally replaced Anna's for my burrito fix. \n\nWhy?\nFood seems much fresher, and the chicken doesn't have those nasty hard pieces of 'mystery meat' that I always get when I have eaten at Anna's. \n\nSeating area kind of sucks - no one really buses their own tables well and it doesn't seem like the staff is on top of cleaning it up. Staff frequently seems a bit clueless. Like I wanted my burrito with guacamole and she looks at me for a minute and then says oh but that's a dollar extra, I said yea ok. and she keeps looking at me. I'm like yea that's fine, put it on there. And she says so are you ok with the extra $1 Yes!! - I said so twice already..... \n\nSo don't come here for the staff or to sit and hang out, but go here for the really fresh and tasty ingredients. Burritos are a little pricey, but they are huge - the price seems about the same as Anna's, but double the size. \n\nMy only gripe, why no quesadillas?"]
["I don't fight with my roommates about anything, really. Just burritos. And, in my mind, nothing is better than Chipotle.\n\nYes, Anna's is just down the street. Yes, Boloco was too (but it closed). And sure, there's a wrap place on the other side of Davis Square too. But Chipotle is incredible with, what I think, are the freshest and best-quality ingredients of any of these places. Not to mention, the chips have always seemed better and fresher to me at Chipotle than Anna's.\n\nBut when I go in Anna's or when I went in Boloco, I've never had someone know my order. I'm going to Chipotle maybe two or three times a month, but when I go in there, employees recognize me and usually know what I want to eat. Sure, it's a chain, but it still feels like a local place when people recognize you and take the effort to remember your order.\n\nThat never happened to me at Boloco or Anna's. And the quality of the food and preparation at Chipotle is superior to what I've received at the other two area burrito places. Unfortunately, they do charge quite a bit for guacamole, so if you're a fan, you're looking at the cost of about a buck being added to your burito. \n\nEither way, I think Chipotle is far superior in both quality and customer service to other burrito places. That's one argument that my roommates definitely won't win."]
["I don't normally review chains, but this is the Chipotle I go to most often. I come here for two reasons: 1) This one is the closest. 2) This one is the best in the greater Boston area.\n\nThis Chipotle does everything all the others do except it does it exceptionally well. They always get my orders right, even when ordering it online. They have great customer service. The burristas are always pleasant, but efficient. Some of the employees remember me, so I like to think they give me a little extra meat in my burrito. The management in here is awesome. I ordered my burrito tonight off of my iPhone (an awesome feature BTW). I always arrive early because I don't want to chance my burrito getting prepared before I get there. I mainly just order online so I don't have to wait in line, but I digress. Tonight when I showed up early, they apologized for not having my burrito done, even though I was ten minutes early! The manager even offered to give me a free drink, which I politely declined. He didn't let me leave without throwing a bag of chips in with my burrito. That's what I call service!\n\nDisclaimer: I feel perfectly okay giving Chipotle 5 stars even though they don't serve an authentic burrito. Heck, the white rice almost makes it a wrap. The issue is that no one out here can make a good burrito (no one can get the mexican rice correct), so I'm fine that Chipotle doesn't even try. They do have an open kitchen, use sustainable farms, and have an ecofriendly business model. I'm a fan."]
["i wish i could give this place 3 1/2 stars.  i hate how much i love it, and the only reason i'm giving it 3 stars instead of 4 or 5 is because honestly, chipotle is chipotle is chipotle.  i prefer anna's, but i usually don't have cash in my pocket so i end up at chipotle just because i'm lazy as hell and when i'm tired i don't feel like going to atm.  lame, i know.  however, i will defend my preference of chipotle to qdoba to the point of a swift kick in the shin.\nforgive me my love of infant-sized burritos, but i just can't bring myself to give them up.  and also, their offerings of *multiple* flavors of tabasco sauce is *so* choice :)"]
["Having recently sworn off corn-fed antibiotic laden meats, I thought I'd never eat a burrito again! Thanks to Chipotle's business practice of using only naturally raised, hormone and antibiotic-free meats, I will still be able to grab a meal on the run and feel ok about it.\n\n(I believe even their dairy products and beans are organic/no-antibiotics/sustainable..but don't quote me.)\n\nhttp://doesabodygood.blogspot.com/search/label/public%20health"]
["I love the burrito bowls at this place.  The best thing is that you can add everything you want aside from the guacamole and still pay the same price.  I have been to other burrito places (Qdoba) and they nickel and dime for basics like veggies...Chipotle claims to use hormone free meats so thats a plus.  I like the unlimited soda fountain and the all you can handle hot sauce selection.  They are also happy to give you extra salsa if you run out.  At work we have many who swear by Anna's burritos, but without getting into that debate I feel that Chipotle is a great burrito place and they actually take a credit card :)"]
["I don't know crap about Texmex but this:\n1) My good friend who just moved up to Boston from Texas swears by Chipotle as the best. stuff. evar.\n2) I have yet to eat any Texmex burrito-y type food that I liked. \n\nOf course, #2 changed once I got myself a steak burrito at Chipotle. I don't know if it's the cilantro rice or what, but the thing was f*cking delectable. Yes, a burrito!  I had no idea! Sorry Texas and Mexico, I take back everything I ever said about your food, I was totally wrong.  I didn't feel ill or heavy after eating one of your massive burritos, everything tasted wonderful and good-quality -- color me impressed.\n\nService at this location was pretty fast, even at prime dinner hours. Great location, great food.  I guess I should feel bad that it's not a local business but I have just not liked what I've had at other places in the area. This is the first time I've had a burrito that wasn't just passable, it was actually really good. \n\nKudos, Chipotle, keep on doing whatever magic it is that you're doing, becuase I'll definitely be back."]
['This is the best location of and of the Chipotles I have visited. I love their veggie salad bowl. Lettuce, fajita veg, black beans, mild salsa, corn salsa and guac. Healthy and fills me for HOURS.\n\nThis staff is by far the best. So friendly, and they all seem to really enjoy working there. \n\nKeep up the good work Chipotle Davis Square!']
["Came in here this afternoon, due to the fact that everywhere in Davis was PACKED full of people due to the holiday. This was the only place with seats available. I had even done two sweeping rounds before ending back here again. \n\nAnd now I know why! The people who worked behind the counter was pleasant, but didn't appear to happy. Meh, I can understand why, sometimes you just wanna go home! I can relate to that. But for Pete's sake, speak up! I can't hear a damn word you're saying. So after finally getting my Carnitas Burrito (after doing all that, What? Huh? I can't hear you? *giving guy dumb look* routine), which included pulled pork, white rice with parsley (? - who uses white rice for burritos anyway?), beans, sour cream, tomatoes, and guacamole (which you have to pay $1.50 extra for, and they only give you a friggin' dollop! WTF, I'm not getting a side of guacamole! If I'm paying $1.50, you best put a few spoonfuls of that bad boy in my damn burrito!). My total which included a small soft drink, $10.08 including tax for ONE friggin' burrito and a coke! \n\nAlright, so all that aside, I got over the price once I sat down. So, I thought, hey if it's that expensive for one meal here, it's gotta be like the bomb diggity, right? Nope, way off! It wasn't bad, but it certainly was not worth the $$$ I just forked over for it. Aside, the guy who wrapped it up, wrapped it all sloppily that I couldn't even hold the burro in my hands without it falling all over the place. I had to eat a friggn' burro with a fork! A FORK! Who eats a burrito with a fork?! Apparently, I had to today. Besides having to eat it with a fork, they only offered Tobasco here! WTF, where's the damn Cholula sauce!  Quiero mi Cholua! \n\nIf the meal was 1/2 the cost, I'd probably would have been more satiisfied and less disappointed, but alas it was not. \n\nNext time, I'll go to Anna's or Qdoba instead! At least they can wrap a burrito AND they have Cholula. Oh yes and it doesn't cost me $10 for ONE MEAL!"]
['If this is what "natural" tastes like, bring on the additives.\n\nYes, Chipotle is all about not adding any weird stuff to your meats. That\'s very nice, and I wish more establishments would follow through. BUT it should still taste good. All in all, their (very large) burrito is a mushy mess. It\'s not terrible-tasting, exactly; the flavor was okay. A bigger problem was the temperature: the salsa and guacamole were ICE COLD, which made for an odd experience biting into the pocket.\n\nAn even bigger problem: the cost. Barbacoa burrito with guacamole and small drink: $10.19. \n\nStick to Felipe\'s and Anna\'s. Your mouth AND your wallet will thank you. As for the additives--did you really want to live to be a hundred, anyway?']
['Chipotle is one of my favorite "fast food" chains for the quality consistency of its products.  The chicken is always flavorful and juicy and all the meats are of the highest quality.  Yes, the guacamole is an extra $2, but it is always extremely fresh and they give you about an avocado\'s worth at every location.  The Davis Square location has some of the friendliest staff you will find at ANY restaurant, let alone a burrito joint.  Chipotle is always a tasty, fast and accessible option for lunch or dinner.']
['A friend warned me to avoid Chipotle\'s burritos and instead eat a "Burrito Bowl" which is a burrito without the tortilla. Allow me to go on about this "Burrito Bowl"...\nYou will get soggy rice, covered with your choice of meat, beans, salsa, iceberg lettuce, and cold, unmelted, pre-shredded cheese. If you get steak, it will put you out about $9 bucks. \nThe only thing redeeming about this place is their use of hormone-free meat.']
['Chipotle is serviceable chain Mexican food, better than taco bell, about the same as Anna\'s Taqueria, your burrito made in about 25 seconds, loaded with the ingedients and put into tacos or burritos, whatever your preference...I\'m yawning just thinking about it, and writing this review..so don\'t go out of your way for this, but if your co-workers drag you there, then I suppose you can suffer through it\'s mediocrity...your best bet is to go down to Boca Grande and get a Chicken Colorado burrito or a tamale there...Boca Grande kicks butt over Chipotle and Anna\'s...so yeah, 2 stars and "meh" is all this place deserves...and the weird cyber Aztec decor, what\'s that all about?  I\'ll give them 3 stars for sort of a Steam-Punk Aztec aesthetic...but that\'s about it.']
["This must be where pregnant chicks come to self induce labor, because tonight there were 3 pregnant biddies at Chipotle. When you can fill up on beans and customize your spice levels, it really just makes sense, doesn't it? Chipotle is more expensive than I remember it being.... But about 50%. Whatever. I'm full. \n\nVegetarian burrito with two kinds of salsa: corn AND red tomatillo. Built on a sturdy base of white rice, the black beans meshed perfectly with the addition of bell peppers and onions. A sweet topping of guacamole made the wrapped log of carbs completely balanced, and the tin foil wrapping made me smile like I do every Christmas morning. Yay for the bag of chips and the spicy salsa, and two thumbs up for the sleek mod interior."]
['Down below is my review of the Medford Chipotle. This Chipotle is basically the same, although I\'ve had a bit better luck with the Davis Square location, both service and food wise. Chipotle is great, and this location is getting better. I have hope that within a year or so, it\'ll be up to the Texas standard of Chipotle that I\'m used to.\n==\nChipotle is amazing. I recently moved back to Boston from Austin, where Chipotle is fairly popular. If this were an Austin area Chipotle, it\'d be 5 stars, but this particular one is not quite as good as the ones down in Texas. The service is great and quick, but a few times it\'s been obvious the ingredients have been sitting out too long. 8/10 times it\'s great.\n\nThe value is very comparable too. The burritos are significantly bigger than Anna\'s, and I find the meat much more flavorful. Worth the extra few bucks.\n\nThe best burrito you can get here:\nBarbacoa, rice, black beans, half corn salsa, half hot red salsa, cheese.  FWIW, this is "non-standard" (two salsas) but the servers here have never had a problem with it and I come here very frequently.']
["omg ewwwwwwwwww i h8 chipotle bc its all like corporate and stuff!!!!1  i mean jesus christ go to anna's its like right next door lololol!!!!!!!!!111\n\n...\n\nOh wait: Chipotle is actually fucking delicious.  My mistake."]
["Chipotle is amazing. \n\nHaving gone to school in Maryland, I went through withdrawal every time I came back to the Boston area for breaks. I'm so glad they've opened one up so close!\n\nHere's why I like Chipotle:\n- you decide what's included in your order\n- the food feels fresh, not greasy\n- the burritos are BIG\n\nEnjoy!\n\nPS The cups have cute stories on them!"]
['Chipotle is a great restaurant chain! I appreciate their attention to fresh ingredients and the simplicity of their menu. I find that the staff is always friendly and the place is clean. I like the fact that i have received emails for free burritos and coupons in the mail. When i was in college i looked into possibly interning for their company and they are bunch of really great people based in Denver. If you have a chance check out their website its really fun!\n\nThe place has tasty Mexican food for a good price.']
["I wasn't very impressed when this place first opened, I had frequented one in NYC that I thought was far better. However, I figured I would give it some time and then try again.  I went back last week and thankfully the quality had improved. I will definitely eat here again. I like to get the burrito bowl or the salad bowl because it is a good value and a filling portion."]
["So little town, so much Fresh Mex! Davis/Porter Square is already so laden with burrito joints, it's just come down to a matter of personal preference. Each place has its own twist on an old idea. Here's my ranked list of Fresh Mex restaurants in the area:\n\n1) Qdoba (I heart queso)\n2) Chipotle (close second - salsa's better than Qdoba but meat was chewier)\n3) Anna's (for a more authentic experience; chili verde is so greasy good!)\n4) Boloco (trailing far behind the others)\n\nIf any of you restaurant owners are listening, food for thought: offer free guacamole in the burrito!"]
["The chips are good otherwise I might have to give this place just one star.  Totally un-inspired burritos.  About the only positive thing I can say about this place is that it's better than Qdoba.  I think."]
['I love Chipotle. Had it in Chicago a few years back before it made its way to Boston. I used to drive to the hell-hole called wellington to get it after that. When it came to Davis Sq.... wow... my life has changed.  Food is a bit pricey, but the burritos/tacos/salads are awesome and bigger than what you get down the street.\n\nYes, it is owned by McDonalds.  And I love both. America is so great.']
['Okay, after all the hype, I had to try this place out.  I went on opening day and first of all, there were Chipotle groupies lined up.  I\'m not kidding.  This guy told me he\'d "been with" Chipotle for years in 7 different states.  He was very nice but I can read the menu myself, there are like 5 things on it.\n\nI get the impression that Qdoba blatantly ripped off Chipotle, very similar menu iterms.  Chipotle executes them much better.\n\nI got the barbacoa burrito with the corn salsa and some hot salsa.  The thing was HUGE but more expensive than Anna\'s, so value wise, about the same.  Basically, I love condiments more than I like food -- hot sauce is a food group to me.  So, the salsa collection is exciting.  The rice was spiced nicely, I like.  \n\nI don\'t like the sterile steel ambiance.  Another aspect of this place I guess Qdoba copied.\n\nThe thing is, this place calls itself "gourmet."  There\'s nothing gourmet about it.  It\'s just burrios.  Burritos are what you eat because they\'re cheap and they\'re there.  And for that reason, Anna\'s is still the #1 burrito spot in town.']
["Hey balloonheads, you know this place is owned by McDonald's Corporation right?  So you probably know that if you eat here, you're getting a McDonald's product.  It's good enough for a poke but it's pretty expensive for a McDonald's product.  Bastards.  Go to Olecito instead kid."]
["I ordered a shredded beef burrito with the corn salsa and the hot salsa. The burrito was as cold as it was outside, the corn salsa was super sweet, and I have yet to taste anything hot. I would give it a 2/5 on the heat scale. My DC ordered a grilled steak burrito with mild salsa because she is allergic to spice ;-)...wouldn't you know her burrito was about 3-4 times hotter than mine to the point where she had to eat plain tortilla chips in between bites to calm her taste buds....lol. It was easily a 4/5 heatwise. I would probably NEVER go here again and just walk the extra block and a half to Anna's the next time I am in Davis Square."]
["Yum! Excellent burritos, the freshest ingredients and politically correct. They use all local produce and meats from humane places. The place is always so clean and did I mention it's yummy!?!?!?! Very casual and relaxed atmosphere, staff always so nice.  They're waiting on a liquor licence, but might be serving beer soon."]
["I got dinner at Chipotle last night, and I was very pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself is kind of small and I probably wouldn't choose to hang out in there very long, but they do have a patio which is going to be a huge plus is the spring/summer, ESPECIALLY when they start serving booze! I got a chicken salad, which is pretty much a burrito without the tortilla, on top of romaine lettuce. The chicken was excellent, as was the chili-corn salsa, and the lettuce was really fresh and crispy (no nasty brown bits).\n\nI was a bit surprised at how expensive it was, $7 for a bowl of lettuce with chicken, beans, corn, and cheese (no sour cream or guac even!). Is that the going rate these days? Also, there aren't a ton of seats inside, so I can see it getting a bit tight when the cold weather finally hits and the patio closes.  still, I am debating going back for dinner today... mmm"]
['By far the best Mexican food anywhere in the Greater Boston area.  Tasty, fast burritos made with quality ingredients.  Chipotle may lack the variety of some other Mexican restaurants--burritos, tacos, and chips are the menu offerings--but what they do they do very well.  Soft, flavorful tortillas, cilantro-rice, lime chips, plentiful salsa and sauces, good guac, attentive service.  The list goes on and on.  The horrible Boston "Taqueria" should be running scared.\n\nI visited the Davis Square location the day it opened and the staff was much better prepared than I expected for the first day.  I live nearby and had seen them training for the past week.  The burrito-wrapper at the end of the assembly line could have used a little polish, but you can expect good service even now, the first week of this location\'s existence.\n\nI am always fond of faster food restaurants with great, affordable vegetarian options, and Chiptole fits the bill.']
["This McDonald's Owned burrito place is the best I've ever come by Anna's is a close second and all others just taste plain and dry like a burrito with just rice and beans in it. Anybody who doesn't agree better be a Mexican because i am and unless you are then you have no stand to tell me what good Mexican is unless you want to suggest the next place i should go try. I recommend a chicken burrito with everything on it for those with the big appetites. Chipotle really is a treat and if your pallet wasn't designed to enjoy that type of thing that really sux for you. If you haven't gone to this place though i urge you that's its worth a try."]
["I love Chipotle. I'm not usually a fan of chain fast-food, but their burritos really get me. \n\nI love the guacamole. It's probably the best guac I have access to (much better than the green mush you can buy in the supermarket). I've tried to recreate it at home, and just can't. \n\nThe beef is hormone free, so yay for that. My roommate, who is a vegetarian, loves their vegi tacos. I'm big on the steak burrito. \n\nYou can count on the fact that your burrito/taco will be HOT if you want it to (and possibly if you don't - I like hot, so this works for me). And their food i consistently good, which is more than nearby (sometimes better, sometimes worse) burrito establishments."]
["I made my first ever trip to Chipotle today after hearing so much about it.  It's yummy but I can't really tell the difference between there and Qdoba.  Granted my palate isn't the most refined. $6.56 for one burrito seems a bit steep but I suppose it's technically a meal and a half.  If you are into stuffing your face with burritos, you can't go wrong here."]
['I do not get the appeal of this place. In the ongoing dumbing down of ethnic foods Chipotle takes its place right next to Olive Garden. It is the "Wonder Bread" of tex-mex food. By which I mean it is bland, tasteless and devoid of nutritional value. OK, maybe it has nutritional value but it definitely has no flavor. \nI tried a barbacoa burrito. I was informed by the menu that the barbacoa is specially spiced and marinated beef of the highest quality. If they were going for the flavor and consistency of cardboard then they got it right. The cilantro in the salsa was non-existent and the only consistent taste I got from my burrito was that of the beans and the tomatoes in the salsa. I asked for guacamole but for all the flavor it added I might just as well have asked for green school paste. This is easily one of the worst burritos I have had in recent memory. I think the only way I would choose to eat a burrito from Chipotle was if someone was offering me one from Taco Bell but that choice isn\'t a no-brainer.\nIn an area like Davis Sq. with two other clearly better options in Anna\'s and Boloco it will be interesting to see if "Wonder Bread" is still on the Davis Sq. menu in a year or so. My fear is that the Olive Garden generation is larger than I think and the answer will be yes.']
["Chipotle is fine if you live in the middle of Amish country and think that taco bell is mexican.  However, if you frequent Davis, why would you even bother?  Are you really so drunk that you can't stumble a few more feet to Anna's?"]
["Being the newest location in MA of this national chain, we decided to check it out. The restaurant we wanted to go to was closed for renovations anyways. There was a line but being a fast food joint it moved quickly. The ingredients are laid out behind the counter so you can decide what to choose like black versus white bean, chicken, pork, beef, etc. The ingredients appeared very fresh and the resulting burrito was ginormous! So I did expect it too be very fulfilling, but instead it was just filling. It lacked a certain somethin, somethin. Maybe hot sauce, or some other spices? I think it's worth another visit and probably just a matter of finding the right combination of ingredients to hit the spot."]
["I received a coupon for a free burrito in my mailbox, so I went to Chipotle last night to redeem it.  I had a steak burrito with hot salsa and sour cream.\n\nPros: \n- burrito was huge\n- salsa was actually hot\n\nCons:\n- steak was tough and gristly\n- prices were high (about $1.50 more than a similar super burrito at Anna's)\n\nIf there weren't 2 Anna's, Tacos Lupita, and Boca Grande all within walking distance, I would be happier with Chipotle.  As is, I'd rather walk two doors down and have an Anna's burrito."]
["with an hour left on our zipcar reservation this weekend, i suggested to my boyfriend that we try chipotle. i had been to chipotle's before in texas and california (when i was there for work..not that i go to the meccas of mexican food in the US and go to freakin chipotle of my own free will) but he never had, and i thought it would be a good opportunity to check out all the change in our old 'hood and get tasty burritos. (man, the cvs/boston sports club building is all finished now! and is sacco's closing?!)\nthis is by far the SMALLEST location i've ever been to. it doesn't have much room at all to eat inside but a lot of outside tables. i don't know if chipotle realizes this or not but we are in MASSACHUSETTS. aka you can only really eat outside without heat lamps for like...4/5 months of the year. INVEST IN MORE INDOOR SEATING. fortunately (unfortunately?) it wasn't that crowded, so there was plenty of space. i still have to take off a star for that, though - i can only imagine what it's like at lunchtime :/\nand the price of the burritos. holy crap. i always order a veg one so when mine rang up at a little over $5, i didn't complain because that's basically the price of a veg burrito at anna's (and this burrito is like the size of my head). later in the night when my boyfriend realized he had no cash it was because his carnitas burrito was EIGHT DOLLARS!!!!! are you KIDDING me?! WTF kind of burrito is EIGHT DOLLARS?!? \nyeah, i doubt i'll come back. besides, for me, chipotle = sitting outside in the sun, drinking a corona, stuffing my face. considering that this place's liquor license is pending, and it's december, there's really no draw."]
["Definitely better than Anna's, but this particular place was below par for Chipotle's.  Had some fatty meat, and the chips were a little stale."]
["I much prefer this to overrated Anna's.  Fresh ingredients, although the lettuce was a little bitter (it was January, so I'll let it slide).  The one big problem that I had was the service.  There was nobody in there, but it took them a long time to make the burritto, and it was cold by the time I sat down.  I've been a few times since, and they seem to have improved this somewhat."]
["When my husband and I lived in Chicago, we used to go to Chipotle there.  Yum!  We moved to Boston and some friends raved about Anna's, so we went there with them once.  Awful.  It lacked seasoning and everything just was very watery and soggy.  Chipotle, on the other hand, is always fresh and flavorful.  Complaining on the basis of it being a chain or because of affiliation with McDonald's is a logical fallacy.  It's like saying that Germany is bad and evil because it was associated with Hitler (okay, on a slightly smaller scale).  Do I think most fast food joints are crummy?  Yup.  Do I like McDonald's?  Rarely.  Do I think McD's was smart to invest in this company after it had taken off because it was doing well?  Yup.  Forget all the snobby hang ups.  A good meal is a good meal is a good meal.  If you're gonna complain, complain on the basis of taste, not business structure or affiliation.  Also- to the people complaining about the burritos falling apart- peel the foil off a little at a time as you eat."]
['There are only two good things about this place: the location (right in the heart of Davis Square) and the price (it\'s cheap -- I don\'t get the complaints that it\'s "over priced.") But it\'s not very good. The burritos are sloppy. The ingredients aren\'t fresh. It\'s just one big  chain restaurant mess.']

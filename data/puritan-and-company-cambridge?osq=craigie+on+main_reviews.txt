["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']

Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having.

The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon!

That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal.

Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]

We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]

As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot.

It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay.

Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]

Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]

The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]

Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]
["Came here for a company holiday party and it was great! The cocktails are amazing, top shelf liquor and the food is really filling. \n\nI would love to come check out brunch here too! I've heard great things, the staff is very nice!"]
['I had heard a lot of great things about this place before we ended up coming here for dinner.  The food is really good, but portion size/price are a bit off which is why I wouldn\'t give a full 5 stars. \n\nI had heard that the menu was "weird/interesting" but I thought it was great. We had the cured meat plate, two side salads, asparagus and the fried fiddleheads.  They were all great. And the bread that they serve could be the best dinner rolls at any restaurant ever. They are salted and fresh. A+ for that.  \n\nFor dinner, we had the salmon, the rib eye, the chicken and a pasta dish with rabbit. Everything tasted great.\n\nThe only knock is that you pay a lot to eat here and don\'t leave overly full.']
["They told us the wait for a table was one hour, so we sat at the bar, which was okay but 30 minutes later there were at least 6 empty tables with 4 or more seats on them. \n\nAnyway - my Bloody Mary was good, I would've like a bit more horseradish and garlic. I had the Duck Confit Has browns with eggs, and it was really good, the bits and pieces of duck in the potatoes were crispy and savory, very umami-like in your mouth. \n\nMy wife and daughters pancakes were the best I've tasted, just the perfect blend of softness and puffiness, lots of air and mixed very well. There's a lot of it, too, one order probably enough for 2.\n\nService was cheerful, our bartender was fast, efficient and very personable."]
["Note: This is for restaurant week.  Entirely possible they looked at our dusty coats and laborer's hands and gave us the business.\n\nThis place, like just about every other fancy place with an ampersand in it (Alden &amp; Harlow, Tap &amp; Trotter), definitely puts emphasis on atmosphere.  Unfortunately (also like Alden &amp; Harlow) that seems to come at the expense of food and service quality.\n\nOur server was really excited about everything but paying attention to us.  After we ordered it was roughly 30 minutes before our first wine accompaniment came out, and another 20 before the food it was meant to accompany joined it.\n\nWe had gazpacho the consistency of Campbell's tomato soup with a single shrimp cut into pieces into it.  We also had a savory flan dish, which itself was kind of bland, but the ham that came with it was dynamite.  This would sort of be the same for the rest of the meal, the accompaniments outshined the rest of the dish.\n\nMy thinking is this place might be better at the bar with a few charcuterie bits.  The meal itself was fairly pricey for what ended up being kind of ordinary food.  Definitely not a bad place, but not one I'd go back to for dinner."]
["Charcuterie! That is one thing that I remember most from my experience at Puritan &amp; Co. Yes, it was one of the most scrumptious beef charcuterie I've had! Pretty generous portion as a bonus too :) \n\nNote that the menu changes occasionally. Last time my fiancé and I came here, we had a bowl of roasted brussel sprouts. It was perfectly cooked: smoked, slightly sweet, and buttery. My fiancé ordered the pork entree (sorry, can't recall the name exactly) and he really enjoyed it. I ordered the pan seared scallop entree, which was also delicious. \n\nThe ambiance was romantic and classy, so I'd recommend this for a date night. Prior reservation would be necessary though, as this place is tiny and can get very busy during dinner time on the weekend. Overall service was excellent; the food came in time without a hassle. \n\nI'd definitely come back to check out their tasting menu! \n\nTip: they offer a valet service, so don't worry if you can't find a parking nearby :)"]
["4 1/2 stars actually.\n\nJust went for the 2nd year in a row on a Gilt city deal.  This time it was a 6 course chef's tasting menu.  We got the wine pairings (had to ask for it because it's not on the menus) also--figure that the money I save gets spent in wine when I use a deal!\n\nThe sommelier was great--super attentive and teaching us about all the wines and why he chose them to pair with our meal.  A mini-wine lesson!\n\nThe food was also delicious.  A salman tartare starter, a farm raised-egg with salad (my favorite!), an eel &amp; eggplant dish (the only one my husband and I didn't love--too fishy for me), a black pepper pasta with corn and crab--delicious!, hangar steak with broccoli rabe &amp; chimichurri sauce, and then chocolate ganache with marscapone ice cream and chocolate cake crumbles.  \n\nI also was shocked that we were in their system so they remembered that my husband can't eat mussels.  On one hand, a little big brother-ish, on the other hand, a really nice touch.  \n\nHighly recommend this place!"]
['Puritan &amp; Co. is on point every time. I\'ve been twice now for themed dinners -one office holiday party with a "beef" theme, which I loved even though i\'m not a huge red meat person, and for their Valentine\'s dinner, which was divine. The cocktails are delicious and strong, the food satisfies and impresses. \n\nMost recently, on Valentine\'s, I started with pork belly, graduated to a mushroom velouté, a beet tagliatelle (unique and rich!), and finished off with a "chocolate cake". I put that in quotations because the cake was very dense, almost fudge-like, but very very good. \n\nOur waitress provides excellent service. She was attentive but not overbearing and was fun to talk to on top of that! Puritan &amp; Co. also offers valet service, which is awesome because street parking can be hard to find in Cambridge especially in the evenings. \n\nI\'ve heard they do an amazing brunch, so I\'ll be back for that soon! It\'s a winner!']
["Pork belly pancake was unique, rich, and very large for an appetizer. The fried oysters were the best part, to combine the crispiness with the cake-y pancake with bits of pork belly. \n\nBecause our entrees were taking a while to come out (although we didn't feel like we were waiting that long) the waitress brought over crab and bisque soup which was smooth and had a nice curry flavor.\n\nFor entrees, I got the seared hake that came in a seafod bisque with mussels, potatoes, and scallops. It was freezing outside that day, so it was a perfect dish to warm you up and the crispy skin on the hake was perfection. Dry-aged pork chop was replaced with a pig they had that day which was extremely tender and cooked just right.\n\nThe atmosphere is simple and homey, even the bar looks like an extension of someone's dining room. There are plenty of tables, but since it was a Saturday night it looked pretty busy so a reservation is highly recommended."]
["Great service. Our server was attentive and kept checking back to ask whethet everything was okay. The food was communicated and delivered properly without any onion/garlic and with sauces on the side due to my allergy, and she also made great recommendations for wine and beer according to our tastes and switched out the beer when my boyfriend said it wasn't what he was looking for.\n\nI'd highly recommend the octopus and squid appetizer. It's perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nInteriors are fun, trendy, and upscale but not stuffy at all."]
["Puritan has the potential to be great, but it was a mediocre experience. The fish sandwich was pretty good, but the brioche bun was cold like out of a fridge. Not great for a sandwich. All french fries came out cold. Not slightly warm, not lukewarm, but just cold, meaning they couldn't have been made any less than 45 minutes before at a minimum.\n\nIf everything was great the prices would be SLIGHTLY high, but given the basic mistakes that were made it is not a good value whatsoever."]
['Went here at least twice for the past year, once during regular week and other on Restaurant Week. They never disappoint! The egg in the jar might be my first pick but we did not find that on the menu during our last visit few months ago. The dishes are always very inventive, fresh, and New England hearty. \n\nLooking forward to another visit - reservations highly recommended!']
['Came\nFor brunch on a Sunday. Our party had reservations for 7 and were lucky to have it as it was a busy weekend. We started with a Bloody Mary and coffee. I had the fish sandwich which was perfectly moist on the inside with a crisp exterior served on a warm toasty bun. Even the side of breakfast potatoes were done just right.']
["Their brunch is excellent, but dinner (the tasting menu) is just okay.\n\nMany people have raved about their brunch so I won't say much here - my standard go-to brunch place if I want to have brunch with friends from out of town. Good options with perfect ambiance. \n\nI finally tried their dinner the other day. My boyfriend and I got the tasting menus for $75 per person, and it was just okay. They tried to be innovative but kind of over did it, in my opinion - lots of interesting ingredients and funky combos, but not really tasty. It was a Friday night and the restaurant was kind of empty, so it didn't make for a fun night out atmosphere either. I personally won't recommend dinner here."]
["Puritan &amp; Company is quickly coming to a favorite. From the Prime Rib Sunday Dinners to they're special three course snow day dinners - they are truly looking to become a neighborhood restaurant. Great staff all around and the interior is gorgeous (after my first visit, I told my husband *that* is what I want our house to look like - perfect mix of rustic and industrial. Even the bathrooms get a massive thumbs up - maximizing the small space they have by putting the sinks outside the restrooms in the hall. It really is a fantastic use of space.\n\nI love how seasonal the menu is and how they change it to accommodate the available produce and proteins. From cocktails to wine pairings, from raw items like oysters and carpaccio to braised meats and roasted fish - everything they choose to do, they do incredibly well. \n\nI've yet to make it out for brunch but am really hoping to remedy this soon!"]
["Our party of 4 had a nice time but the food and service was hit-or-miss.  I got the chicken liver mousse as an app.  The mousse was DELICIOUS!  Unfortunately, there was hardly any mousse on the plate.  It looked like the dirty plate of someone who had ordered the mousse, eaten it, and then told the server they were finished with it!  \n\nI was disappointed but I didn't want to be a stick-in-the-mud, so I didn't complain.   Then came my entree, which was also really good.  But again, there was a problem - small gravel/ sand in my steak with grilled greens.  As the server pointed out - it was probably attributable to the locally-sourced greens which weren't washed properly.  But it made me afraid to continue with the dish for fear of needing major dental work.  And it also made me ready to ask for the check.\n\nI won't be rushing back despite the generous roominess and comfy decor."]
['What a wondrous time we had at Puritan &amp; Co!   Every minute detail from the relaxing ambiance to our sommelier\'s excellent wine suggestions to our server, Adrian\'s seamless service to the amazing food, we couldn\'t have had a better experience.  \n\nEven our busser and food runners were absolutely dynamite.  Our water glasses were always filled, the silverware changed and our table wiped clean after every course.   Food runners effortlessly showcased the courses they brought out, describing how each were prepared and what ingredients were used.\n\nFor our visit, we had the guilty pleasure of sampling their 6-course seasonal tasting which was an elegant mix of their on-menu items served in slightly smaller portions to accommodate the 6-course roll out.\n\nFor our first course, we tried the amazing scallop crudo.   So fresh and such high quality!  Then, a tasty beet salad topped with crunchy granola bits were brought over to tease our taste buds for our 3rd course, the grilled zucchini.  The mix of pesto sauce, chanterelle mushrooms and farm egg came together so well, it was like an orchestra.  I ended up using some of my roll to dip into the leftover pesto oil :)\n\nOur fourth course featured an incredible squid ink linguine and oh man, it was crazy delicious!   So flavorful and not really with just an "octopus bolognese" as I actually had whole pieces of octopus tentacles in my dish.  YUM!  Our fifth and main course was their on-menu grilled prime skirt steak prepared with black fried rice and shiitake mushrooms.  Since I only eat fish, they subbed mine for the striped bass but stayed with the same recipe.  Steak was cooked rare to perfection and my bass was moist and had the most delicate crunchy skin.  We thoroughly enjoyed our entrees.\n\nFor our last course, we were served the sticky toffee pudding a la mode with caramel sauce.   A nice sweet ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nAll in all, a fabulous occasion and one that I personally would compare to Craigie On Main, Bisq and Alden &amp; Harlow in the Cambridge area.  Just love, love, love this place and we will be back!']
["Finally got a chance to try out Puritcan and Co thanks to Gilt City. The space is modern and slightly hipster. Our waitress was very nice, but the shout out goes to the bartender who was extraordinarily knowledgeable about his beers. We had a fantastic bottle that was served like wine in a decanter!\n\nOur menu:\n- Swordfish with pumpernickel puree\n- Hay roasted beets and carrots with blue cheese puree\n- Farm egg with asparagus and fried shiitake\n- Squid ink linguine with octupus bolognese\n- Skirt steak with green garlic puree and black rice\n- Ice cream\n\nMost of the dishes were quite tasty. Stand outs are actually the vegetarian dishes. The roasted beets and carrots had a really nice smoky flavor from the hay. Even though I'm actually not a huge brunch fan, the farm egg dish would have been the fantastic brunch dish.\n\nSo while there really were no misses, I did deduct a star for the fact that the tasting menu they served for Gilt City appeared quite different from the regular menu we saw other people having. The most noticeable was our measly plain ice cream rather than a nice looking dessert on other's table. So in the end, this menu was not really a deal at all but a pared down version.\n\nNevertheless, we had a really nice meal here and would not hesitate to come back again, for the full experience!"]
["I am so happy I chose to go to Puritan and Co. for brunch. The restaurant has a shabby/industrial vibe going on with a lot of country elements. Overall the place felt really homey and hip at the same time. I have been a few times for late night drinks and I was excited to have a proper meal here. We were seated immediately without a reservation, which is a rare and cherished moment in Inman square.\n\nMy eyes lit up when I noticed THEY HAVE A FULL ON PASTRY BAR! Yes! A beautiful display of tons and tons yummy pastries. I couldn't resist getting a 4-pastry basket as my brunch. I noticed a lot of other folks getting the pastries as an appetizer, and after eating one I was barely sure that I could scarf down another. But it was GLORIOUS. I chose the monkey bread pastry that was a cheese bread with caramelized onions, and I was able to get through a chocolate croissant. The pecan cinnamon bun and cheese Danish went home with me with promises of another GLORIOUS breakfast.\n\nAlong with the pastries I got a mimosa which was pretty good. I mean, you can't really screw that up. But I was happy with the size of the mimosa. I felt that it was a bit more substantial than what I get at a lot of other brunch spots. Anyway, after I secured a decent food baby, we signed the check 30 minutes after siting down and I was promptly rolled out of the restaurant (like sideways...willy wonka blueberry girl style). \n\nI think the brunch at Puritan and co. was awesome and I will be recommending it to anyone that will listen! Cheers!"]
['Luke warm. Utterly Expensive. Horrendous. These are just a few words that encapsulate my family\'s experience at Puritan &amp; Company. \n\nMy family found Puritan &amp; Co. through Yelp, and, based on the good reviews, we decided to give the restaurant a shot. As soon as we got to the entranceway, we tried pulling the door open. It was heavy. It was deceptive to its appearance. Little did my family know that the door would be a metaphor for tonight\'s meal. \n\nGlancing through the menu, my family decided to go with the 6-course tasting menu. We were first greeted with a nano-scale scallop dish. As we munched on the scallops, we all noticed that the scallops were so warm that we could all feel the food poisoning seeping through our taste buds. We thought, "It\'s just a fluke." By golly, we were wrong. \n\nThe next dish came, and, I thought to myself, am I perceiving this correctly? The plate consisted of boiled clams over a luke warm, soupy base, with french fries sprinkled over the top. Who on earth thinks it is good to combine french fries with a clammy soup? However, my family does not give up easily. We still had hope in this restaurant. \n\nThen, came the pasta. Served in a dull, wooden bowl, the pasta seemed as though it was a fancy prison meal, with its creamy consistency almost forcing you to vomit. The noodles themselves were cooked so long that I thought the pasta noodles would have had a higher chance of dissolving than actually making it into my mouth. My family\'s hope was dimming by each course, but was not fully out the door yet. \n\nThe final main course was the steak. As it came out, I thought that they were serving it to the kids at the pee wee baseball league nearby. It was tiny! As the piece of steak touched my taste buds, all of the taste was blocked out by the temperature of the piece. Yet again, our food was luke warm. What I was eating felt exactly like swimming past someone who had just peed in the pool. \n\nFor the dessert, we already knew what to expect. Our hope was skinned alive and thrown out of a four story high window. As the dessert was presented to us, the "cheesecake" looked like minuscule bread crumbs. The cheesecake\'s frosting was placed in the middle of the plate, not on the individual crumbs. I did not know if I was eating dessert or going to feed some ducks at Fresh Pond. Pretty much 250 dollars down the drain. Worst of all, they charged a 3% staff fee.\n\nDisgraceful.']
["Truly enjoyed this restaurant. Not only was the food excellent, but the service was also very good.\n\nBread and butter were brought to the table at the beginning of our meal. I normally do not eat bread, but their bread was warm....and I like warm bread :-) \n\nDinner: I had the tuna tostadas special as an appetizer. It was flavorful and a nice start to the meal. For my entree I enjoyed the cast iron roasted ribeye which was cooked perfectly. I love ribeye. My only issue is that if it's a 12 oz steak, there's only about 8 ounces of edible meat. That's good for me since I cannot (do not want to) eat more than that. The meat itself was of very high quality. I ordered it medium rare and it was delicious. The ribeye comes with fingerling potatoes, ramp butter and Brussel sprouts. I added fried fiddleheads to my meal as well. The fiddleheads were OK. I enjoyed them, but they were just OK. \n\nDrinks: I started with a Paloma. With dinner we enjoyed a bottle (or 2) of red wine that was highly recommended by the sommelier. He was quite a character and we really enjoyed speaking with him throughout our meal. He was kind enough to share some dessert wine with us as well. \n\nDessert: We shared a deconstructed carrot cake which was delicious. I can't remember the other dessert, but I do recall it being yummy. \n\nPrices are on par with the area (on the higher side in general compared to other parts of Cambridge). Parking can be tough. Uber may be the best bet.   \n\nI will certainly return to Puritan again. It was a very nice experience.\n\nFood pics on IG @potsandpens"]

['I\'m going to be honest, I was never really one to order hamburgers or crave them. If I were to go out to eat, it\'d be the last thing I would order. Not because I don\'t like them, but simply because I think there are better options out there. When I told this to one of my colleagues, he said "but you haven\'t tried Flat Patties". \n\nSince he introduced me to this shop, I have fallen in love with their European Burger. It\'s simple yet packed with flavor: this particular burger has gruyere cheese, caramelized onions, and aioli. It\'s delicious and I one hundred percent recommend it. They also serve great sides.\n\nThe shop itself is not small but not large. As you walk in, there\'s the ordering counter and grills. There is limited seating on the main floor (and one bathroom), but there\'s seating upstairs or you can take your food to go. Flat Patties is very casual and their staff are friendly, and it\'s conveniently located in Harvard Square.']
['Cheap burgers. I guess good if you are on a budget, but there are much better burger joints to choose from. The bun to patty ratio is off--look at the pictures. I got one of the seasonal specials. The patty was pretty flavorless and bland. I liked that the buns were soft, but since they were so thick it took away from overall burger. \n\nIn conclusion, I would rather pay double the price for a burger at Boston Burger Company.']
["PRO TIP: ADD A DASH OF SALT TO EACH BITE OF YOUR BURGER. It's a game changer.\n\nOn to the review.... I want to give this 4 stars, I do, but they use frozen patties that are pretty poor meat quality so I just couldn't.\n\nPros:\n-toasted bun is delicious\n-fresh cut fries\n-crispy bacon\n-portion size is huge - double is super filling\n-price - double bacon cheeseburger for $7.50\n\nCons:\n-frozen patty, poor meat quality\n-lacking a bit of flavor, needs more salt"]
["Cheese fries are great, but my friend's chili cheese fries looked greasy. Turns out the frozen custard machine was broken so all they had was ice cream. Service was quick and friendly, however. Street parking looks difficult."]
['Not a one of them speaks a lick of English, the burgers were not fresh but precooked in a pan, much like the fries in the fryer basket and bones in the beef!!!!  Have fun!!!']
['This is a very nice ,cozy and chic fast-food restaurant. Everything is nice and clean- warm service and surprisingly great cheap burger/ sandwich- with tasty bun... $4.00 for a chicken sandwich or any  sandwich  is a great bargain in this expensive area! This is a good place to stop by when visit Harvard Square- ideally for a quick bite!']
['Great European Burger! Burger cooked the old fashioned way, with a press. Excellent flavor, no additives, flavorful caramelizad onion topping. Must stop by while trying n Harvard Square.']
['Love this place for a burger and a beer on a budget. For $11 plus tip you get a burger, fries and an ice cold beer. Try their Forager burger with mushrooms!']
["Amazing new breakfast option in Harvard Square! \nWow--Crema was too crowded this AM for breakfast, so I kept walking and discovered that Flat Patties now has breakfast. Just a couple of options--but they're happy to customize to your likes. I had scrambled eggs w/carmelized onions and avocado on a bun. Yum!"]
['it can be near impossible to just get a traditional cheeseburger for less than $5 without resorting to fast food chains. flat patties offers a small menu of burgers (cooked to order) and other griddle sandwiches, salads, and ice cream. all buns come buttered and most sandwiches feature the house sauce, although i am sure they can sub. \n\nthe cheeseburger completely hit the spot, although i wish i had tried the european special with gouda and caramelized onions. the bbq pulled pork sandwich was also great, super juicy and topped with coleslaw.\n\nif they are targeting inexpensive, fast, and tasty, they really hit the mark.']
["This is a 3 1/2 stars. I was pleasantly surprised by the burger but the chicken sandwich was weak (3 stars). While both are average in the realm of good burgers, the cost and sizes are very good for it being in the heart of Harvard Square (4 stars). \n\nTwo other items:\n1. The bun is unique and offers a nice change of pace.\n2. The fries are food but you basically get a small handful. This is where the portions for the cost are weak. If you aren't a fries person, no biggie here.\n\nI gave it a 3 because the chicken was average at best and while the burger was good for the cost, it wasn't a wow. Burgers are 3 1/2-4 stars"]
["Did not really live up to the hype.  Burgers were tasty, but small.  Small portions of fries.  For the price, we were all hungry a couple hours after eating.  Won't avoid this place, but won't go out of my way to go back either."]
["If you haven't had Flat Patties, your inner cheeseburger has never truly lived.  I've lived in Harvard square for 9 years and have tried every burger in the square.  I can say with no lack of scrutiny that this is THE best cheeseburger in Harvard Square (And I'm including the high-end places like Alden and Harlow, Russell House, etc).  It just so happens to also be one of the most affordable - a double will cost you less than $7 currently.  Everything is made from scratch in house. They grind their own beef, bake their own buns, hand cut fries; you get the picture.  What stands out to me is the balance of flavors and textures of this burger; the buttered grilled bun has the combo of soft and crispy, the sauce is just right, and you can actually taste all of the ingredients.  It will take discipline to not order a second one after you quiver your way through this burger deity.  \n\nThis small, unique joint in the heart of the square also offers a small selection of craft beers, salads, homemade frozen custards and milkshakes.  I could go on about other menu items like the amazing fish sandwich and the daily burger specials, but I shan't. Stop reading this and get thee unto Flat Patties."]
["Searching for a small lunch in Harvard Square, I think we found the ideal place. The very affordable and yummy-sounding menu really fit the bill. I had a Sunday Morning burger which came with an egg and smoked tomato jam. Greasy, interesting flavors, decidedly not healthy. I'd come back."]
["I went here on a Sunday and to my dismay this place did not live up to the hype. Cambridge is known for having incredible burger choices so I gave this one a chance because the other one was closed.  When I first arrived I couldn't help but notice the blaring Reggaeton music and the disengaged staff of two employees. I got a double bacon cheeseburger and it really wasn't impressive.  I brought a friend from Rhode Island and I was honestly embarrassed that I talked this place up only to be met with an average backyard grill burger. The search continues."]
['So I am somewhat of a non-fast food hamburger critic. And let me say, this place is amazing! Burger was juicy, bread is homemade... and the onion rings were on point! I would definitely suggest Flat Patties especially for parents visiting college students in the area.']
['Fast service, laid back ambiance, good use if space, quality grilled chicken, not too heavy, overall variety of options']
['I\'m going to give this place two stars only because the Caesar salad (with chicken) that my wife ordered was, according to her, "good".  My burger ... the BBQ Blue ... was not good ... not even close.  It was supposed to be a double burger; it was not.  The BBQ sauce (supposedly made on site) was more like ketchup than anything else.  The bacon was under-cooked and fatty.  The bun was nothing special.  The beef burger itself did not taste fresh.  Probably one the worst $5.50 burger I\'ve ever had.  Oh yeah, they state (on their Yelp attributes) that "all food served with china, glasses, &amp; silverware."  We got paper cups for our beverages and my wife\'s salad was served with a plastic fork.  I had to ask for a real fork (and a knife).  Poor service.']
["The worst customers service ever! First off i go in and the place is empty they have about 5 people working i ask for a burger to go with pickles and ketchup on it and they refused to put the pickles and ketchup on for me and told me i had to do it myself, evan though it was a order to go. I've never been to a burger place that refused to put pickles and ketchup on an order TO GO! Needless to say i will not be going back! I refuse to give my money to a fast food place when the employees get paid to make the food how you want it and can not preform a simple task."]
['Really wanted to like the place, especially for the warm service, great location, and fair prices, but my first cheeseburger from this place was very red and undercooked, and made me feel sick halfway into my burger :(']
["We got two double cheeseburgers: The Forager (Sauteed mushrooms, swiss cheese &amp; horseradish sauce) and the Swiss Gruyere (Swiss gruyere cheese, caramelized onions &amp; rosemary aioli)\n\nBoth burgers tasted fairly similar. Their toppings didn't do all that much to raise the burger to the next level. The burger itself was pretty good, though probably not quite enough fat in the meat blend, giving it a slightly dry mouthfeel and lack of beefy flavors and aroma. Shockingly and unacceptably they don't ask how you'd like your burger cooked, a major faux pas in my book. Not being able to eat my burger at medium rare in a major problem. I expect that type of service for an $8 burger.\n\nThe bun was very good and deserves recognition. It's buttery notes and soft/chewy bite made for an excellent outer shell to a mediocre burger.\n\nFlat Patties is an adequate place to grab a decently priced burger, but it didn't blow me away."]
['Cute, cozy restaurant in the middle of Harvard Square. I tried the grilled chicken sandwich and it was delicious!! The food is freshly made and tastes so natura! Highly recommend this place for a quick cheap bite. Great quality food for an exceptional price and fantastic service! Very close to the red line public transportation.']
["Solid burgers at a good price. Good location too. There isn't much good cheap food, other than pizza slices, I this area. So save money and avoid Shake Shack and head here instead."]
["The good: the burger flavor was amazing and the toasted on one side buns were like I make at home.  Oh, and the location.\n\nThe not so good: none, and literally mean zero, tables were bussed, wiped down or trash picked up from the ground.  Also, they were out of more than half of their non-fountain drinks.  It also took numerous attempts to order.  It felt like they didn't care."]
['A few weeks ago, Chronicle ran a "Best Burgers in Boston" segment. I jotted them down and decided to start checking them out. Flat Patties in Harvard Square, was the random selection today. Great burger, fresh baked bun, crispy bacon, seasoned \'shrooms, special sauce &amp; hand cut fries with skins...yummy! Oh, I almost forgot to mention...a parking space across the street on Brattle. Yeah, that happened! :)']
['Ehhh Tasty Burger is better IMHO. Or better yet go to Border Cafe. All the same price.']
["I saw the place on Chronicle and gave it a shot. The burger I got looked nothing like what was on tv. The bun was amazing and mostly why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. The burger was dry, flavorless and overcooked. I also got chili cheese fries and they where terrible, drowning in watered chili. I won't be going back."]
["5 stars keeping in mind the price to quality ratio. Here's why I keep coming back:\n \n1. The fast food format. \n2. They serve beer (limited selection), and you'll still come in under $10 if you get a burger and beer without fries.\n3. The burgers are good at a great price, the available toppings are interesting, and they're not huge so you won't feel ashamed at the end of the meal."]
["Went out for a long walk today from my hotel in Somerville, and wound up here for lunch. When I went in, three people greeted me with a smile and were patient while I was trying to decide. \n\nI ended up keeping it simple. Cheeseburger with bacon, and an iced tea. The girl behind the counter was quick and efficient taking my order, and before I had signed the credit card slip, my burger was cooking. \n\nWhen it came out, it looked great. Cooked just right, fresh lettuce and tomato and a soft toasted bun. I added pickles, onions and mustard at a self service counter, sat down and dug in. \n\nThe food was delicious, the iced tea was just right. The place was clean and tidy inside. \n\nI'll be happy to return here again."]
['Are you looking for a somewhat decent place to get some burgers in a place like Cambridge? This place has a good selection of burgers and sandwiches and my experiences here were not bad but nothing really special. \n\nThe double cheeseburger they have here is pretty good, really liked the flavor of the juicy meat, but what I enjoyed the most about eating this double cheeseburger was the bun. The bun was nice and toasty on the outside, not overly crispy but not rough to chew, and very soft on the inside. One of these double cheeseburgers should be enough to fill the stomach of a grown man. However, eating one double cheeseburger with fries, and you might feel a little funny, and you probably won\'t be able to "speedwalk" right after you eat them. \n\nBesides the burgers, the fish sandwich they have here is pretty good. Really liked the crispiness and the texture of the fish and the flavor of the cole slaw. They used the same toasted bun as the burgers, which is great. One fish sandwich should be good enough for a decent lunch. \n\nAs for the french fries, they were not that great. There was a nice salty flavor, but the texture was mediocre. The lemonade they had here was refreshing but very sweet. Expect to wait 5+ minutes to get your sandwich/burger, so don\'t expect great service. Atmosphere is a tiny bit grubby, if they could clean the place up better, more people might be able to come. \n\nOverall, if you are looking for a decent place to get burgers or a fish sandwich this is not a bad choice. I may come back here again for a double cheeseburger but not for the fries.']
["Hidden Gem of Harvard Square\n\nGreat place to get a quick salad, burger, or chicken sandwich on your lunch break. \n\nPrices are UNBEATABLE! I didn't think it was possible to eat for so little money in Harvard Sq, and the flavors are fantastic. \n\nI especially recommend their Asian salad and traditional-style burgers! \n\nSeating is decent both inside and outside.\n\nDefinitely check it out at least once. Chances are you will not be disappointed and you will be back again soon!"]
['Great place to get a cheap burger, fries and a drink for $10, which is a steal in Cambridge. The service is pretty fast too. There are many places that make a good burger but flat patties is one of the best.']
['This is a very cute place with good food. I like that you can add sautes onions or avocado to your sandwich/burger and they were delicious. Some good sides too, coleslaw and fries. Good portions for sharing- shared a regular burger and a grilled cheese sandwich, and coleslaw and fries. Good about of setting for two people.']
["There's a lot of good things about Flat Patties, for instance the great location, the fresh ingredients (the bun was soft and fresh), and the slightly browned and juicy patty. \n\nOther things, though, not as great. The fries were cold and undercooked, and the soda is expensive, comes in small cups, and refills are $0.50 a pop. Ordering was also a bit annoying, as the staff seemed way more interested in gossiping than taking my order. \n\nSo - a quality fast food burger, nothing more, nothing less, and skip the fries."]
['This place is not bad compared to some of the other nearby burger joints in Harvard Sq though it still feels a little bit pricey for what you get. I had the double cheeseburger + fries + a serving of lemonade and it was around $13. \n\nFries were decent as well as the lemonade. The burger was alright. Definitely have had better.']
["Love the amazing Asian salad with chicken . Light but filling! Always my favorite place in Harvard square. The burgers are awesome too! Can't go wrong!"]
['My favorite fast-foody burger in the Square.  A good value--hits the spot when I crave a burger.']
["Overall, I enjoyed my food and the ambience, which was more similar to a coffee shop than a burger joint. \n\nThe food was solid. I had the grilled chicken sandwich and onion rings, and the ladies working made it right in front of me (battering the onion rings individually and dropping them into the fryer). Very fresh. Unfortunately, the rings came out greasy and really needed some seasoning. The batter was soft and puffy rather than crispy. The sandwich was better. The chicken breast was marinated and looked somewhat green-ish and was very flat, for better or worse. The bun was soft and nicely toasted, but I kind of wished it were a potato bun.\n\nI'd gladly return, but only if the ShakeShack a block away is too crowded."]
['I wish I\'d read the reviews before stopping here for a burger before an event in Harvard Sq. on Wednesday night.\n\nLike others have mentioned, the service was slow &amp; distracted. Someone started taking my order, then walked away to talk to other employees at the grill. He said "sorry" when he came back, but it was odd. My order was short. Just a cheeseburger &amp; lemonade.\n\nI wasn\'t impressed with the burger. It lacked flavor.\n\nNot worth it when there are so many other quick meal options in Harvard Square.']
["I had a bit of time before my bus came after work, and was looking for a quick spot to satisfy my hunger. There was no line in Flat Patties, so I decided to go with that.  The first thing I noticed was the reasonable price, especially for Harvard Square.  Under $6 for a souped up burger is quite remarkable for its location.  \n\nI ordered the Sunday Morning burger, which has an egg, ham, cheese, and tomato jam on the burger.  Well, at least that's what the menu said, since when it came out it was bacon instead of ham.  Honestly, I'm not mad about that, I would have preferred bacon anyways. But for those who aren't as big of bacon fans (are they even real people?), it might be helpful to update your menu.  \n\nThe burger itself was quite good. Everything tasted well-prepared, and the kicker was definitely the tomato jam.  Really added a nice layer, where other condiments would not have worked nearly as well with these ingredients.  Perfectly satisfied my hunger, while not being too little or too much food. That being said, though, I wouldn't have minded some fries with it. But that one's on me. \n\nOverall, great location, solid price, good burger - nicely done, Flat Patties!"]
["The burritos are served on a tortilla that's more of a a pancake that is firm yet &amp; chewy and to die for! Also, bonus: not very messy. Wide variety of fixings! Mild, sweet, spice, hot, cold, and all kinds of sauces. Chef quality food &amp; service. And, high quality of patrons/customers which are polite &amp; helpful as well.\n\nThe burgers are AMAZING! Fresh pickles in the condiments sliced thin located by the wall. \n\nBottled Coca Cola with original sugar recipe, no high fructose corn syrup, as well as a wide selection of glass bottled sodas, and unique flavored beverages, always cold. \n\nMy finicky kid ACTUALLY ate her food! FOR REAL! And she liked it! \n there's a long line, so you know it must be good! It is! \n\nThe staff is friendly, polite, courteous, accommodating, and VERY helpful. \n\nUnique variety of Spanish music played on the speakers. Once my order was up, it was lots of folk accordion music in Spanish, then before we left it was a brass band music. \n\nIt's a hopping place, so it's quite noisy. But, you can eat inside either upstairs or downstairs, or go outside. You can also order take-out."]
['Small hole in the wall joint with simple tasty menu and few beers on tap. Great for late night snack or a quick bite to eat!']
["Cheap for Cambridge. Burgers are OK -- other chains near by are thicker and more flavorful. My spicy burger wasn't spicy, but it was solid. \n\nFries are extra, and just OK."]
['Has never been the same since they left the garage.\n\nUsed to be the best burger in Cambridge.  Not willing to make that claim anymore.']
['Hospital cafeteria food prepared by 17 year olds. Not even worth the sixty seconds it takes to write this.']
["Maybe I hit this joint on days when things are running smoothly but I've visited it a few times in the last few months and frankly the burgers I've sucked down have been pretty darn good. Juicy but well done, as in cooked through, the patties could use a hit of salt and pepper, but they aren't bad. I've had the Bacon Blue burger several times and the toasted bun was perfect. It carried the beef, bacon, cheese, and generous slathering of BBQ sauce into my face with grace.\n\nThe bun is the stand out- it's crusty on the outside, toasted in the middle and soft inside. It's quite nice. I could also be biased since I rarely ever eat bread anymore but I quite enjoy this bread. Could be that it's slathered with enough butter to be golden brown... The bacon is smokey yet sweet, and while I would have enjoyed a more generous helping of blue cheese it was a balanced serving.\n\nI've never had the beer or soda on tap, but I've been told it's cold and frothy. Fries are better at their competition down the street, but they aren't bad at all.\n\nAll that said, this is one of the cheapest burger joints in Brattle/Harvard Sq. Because it's surely some of the cheapest eats in the HVDSQ area it's almost always slammed- except when HRVD kiddos are home on vacation. I highly recommend visiting during school breaks. So much more enjoyable. In the summer the tiny space turns into a sauna of beefy greasy and sweaty patrons. :x"]
["Found this place for lunch, and it turned out to be great!  We had two beef burgers and a chicken burger, with fries and all were yummy, as well as very reasonably priced. This place was BUSY, but the staff were pleasant and working hard, so people moved through pretty well. There's a condiment bar to add to your burger and a self serve soda fountain, as well as bottled drinks if you prefer. There's a small upstairs seating area in addition to the handful of bar seats/tables on the first floor."]
['Am I missing something? Flavorless burgers, haphazard salads and a soda fountain willfully denied bubbles get a big no thanks.\n\nIf a wand could be waved and every independent biz could succeed, I\'d punch the baby wizard holding it and make like a sparkler on the 4th - trust me, it delivers no joy to endure such a lackluster experience. But I\'ve got to tell you like it is. It\'s my job. IT\'S MY JOB.\n\nMy roasted green chile and double jack burger ($5.50) hit the sweet price point, but at what cost? The beef tasted like nothing, with only the grassy, slightly hot poblano delivering any flavor. On the plus, I enjoyed the structural integrity of the soft yet durable bun. It\'s like the Brawny of the beef-holders. The sandwich as a whole? A big, greasy pass.\n\nThe garden salad of wilted and actual rotten greens is dressed in a "citrus vinaigrette" that came across as watery orange juice, with bland supremes, goat cheese and off-the-shelf candied pecans. It was... gross. Especially the smattering of gone-soupy spring mix. No bueno.\n\nFinally, it can\'t be ignored that 2/3 of the staff were so despondent, they brought down the efforts of the third, who seemed just as exhausted trying to right the overwhelming wrongs. The counter was empty when we popped in and it still took 5 minutes to place an order (a full hour before closing). The fountain sodas had zero carbonation, and when this was mentioned, nothing was done for another ten minutes. After getting our food order, we asked if the CO2 had been changed, they said no because they didn\'t have any.\n\n...\n\nAwkward pause. $4 for empty glasses? Eventually, one employee half-apologetically offered bottled sodas from the cooler.\n\nDecent house-made custard with a dulce de leche drizzle for only $2.50. But the overall experience (and that rancid salad) left a bad taste in my mouth.']
['Food was great. Quality selection of burgers &amp; beer. However, i am giving this place one star as i finish up my meal because they simply got my name wrong. When i walked in, I placed my order with a nice well-spoken woman and proceeded to correct my pronunciation of yuengling as jingling. I could\'ve very well been wrong &amp; i moved on as such. Then i hear a woman yell nick or mick several times and i am now curious to know where my food is. I glance at my receipt and it says MICK. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Mike. That is the word i told the nice well-spoken lady at the register. I recalled that the lady yelled "mick, cheeseburger with fries-no tomato" for several minutes before i picked up my order. I did not order my burger with no tomato. I simply asked for a cheeseburger, with fries and a yuengling and my name is mike. I will be returning to this place at some point to see if they mess up again because the burger was good.']
["wanted to try for a long time I finally did. good burger better than shake shack or tasty's.. just a bacon cheeseburger, but it was good. but if I were them I wouldn't brag about the hand cut fries, they need some work. it was busy when I went so maybe I got a rushed batch but there was no crunch or anything special about them and the larger ones were like just eating a potato  that's the only reason for a 4 star review, overall I will return good burger"]
['We got the double Sunday morning burger that has a fried egg on it, and the European burger with a side of onion rings. \nThey forgot the onion rings and 2nd patty, also the lettuce - no bun paleo request, but they promptly fixed it.\nBurgers tasted good and were cooked medium according to our order.\nWe would try it again.']
['Best burger in harvard square. (Compared to tasty burger and shake shake) good portions, burgers are juicy, pink in the center. \n\nAlso got the frozen custard. Flavor and texture were ruined by icy chunks (maybe its not ordered often in the fall?)\n\nBurger was cooked to order, still got it in under 5min!']
["Meh. I could take it or leave it. It got the job done. I wouldn't rush back, though. The fries uber underwhelmed, and they looked and tasted old af. For what you see + a Nantucket Apple Juice = $11. I got a cheese burger add avocado and onion."]
["Just wanted to grab a quick bite somewhere fast. This was located in Harvard Square and was not crazy busy like a lot of its neighbors. Prices are very cheap, but I guess I can see why. Just got a simple fish and chips and it was not very good. Fish was super thin, super salty. Also, though it wasn't very expensive, it only came w/ like one ish piece per order. Was also going to get their buffalo wings, but though their menu lists it, they did not offer it (at least when I tried to order it). No explanation really of why either."]
["It's rare that I'll ever feel more like a tourist than when I walked into flat patties in Cambridge. Apparently it shares space with a burrito joint, and the signs for lining up even directed you to one side for ordering flat patties versus the burrito counter. Seeing nothing but counters devoted to wrapping burritos and making carne asada made me skeptical that we were in the wrong place or came at the wrong time. Oh well, we came for their burger and their frozen custard milkshake so we had to stick with it, even though there wasn't a college student in sight eating anything but a burrito. \n\nAfter about 5 minutes of sitting in their loft upstairs, we heard our order called out and, low and behold--burgers were actually waiting for us. The buns were very soft, but not quite burger material in my opinion (didn't add any buttery-ness or crisp texture to the burger). Other than that, the rest of the burger was great--I think the fact that we were mentally eating a burger from a burrito joint was throwing off my senses the entire night. No complaints on their dressings or burger patty. Fries were passing, but nothing to write about. \n\nThe milkshake which is supposedly made with frozen custard, I looked most forward to, but left a little disappointed with. First sip, and it was very runny and very un-like a milkshake. All the flavors of a vanilla milkshake were there, but it had the consistency of a watery-milkshake (maybe I stand corrected and that's how milkshakes turn out when made with frozen custard?) But I've had frozen custard before and I don't really know how it could make a shake turn out so wet. The bottom of the drink was very fluffy though, might have to come back and try their frozen custard--overall a very confusing experience, so I'm not sure if I had the true flat patties, or not."]
["My favorite burger place in Harvard Square. My double cheeseburger with bacon came fresh, warm, juicy, delicious. I've tried a few of their other burgers before too, and they are all amazing -- tastier and cheaper than basically all the other burger places in the Square."]
["I'm really happy that I accidentally stumbled upon this place while walking around Harvard Square one day. The veggie burger was delicious, and the prices here are very decent. I got some work done while eating in the upstairs part, and the manager came around to ask how the food was. When I was done eating, I got up to put my tray away and he said not to worry about it and that he would take it for me. \n\nThe staff was very friendly, the food is decently priced and good, and it's in a great location. 5 stars for sure."]
["Did they change the Sunday Morning burger?  Because the past two times I've ordered it, I received bacon instead of ham, and some sauce that seemed quite inferior to the delicious heavenly substance that was their tomato jam (I suspect it had Sriracha in it, and I have *not* jumped on the Sriracha bandwagon)...also it had onions on it.  The first time I thought it was an error, but now that it's been twice in a row, I imagine that it may have been a change.  Dear Flat Patties, if you're reading this, either change your menu to describe the burger more accurately (e.g., ham =/= bacon) or bring back the original!!!"]
["I was RAVING about this place to my best friend before we brought her here for the first time so it was embarrassing when we got our orders. I love the burgers here with their croissant crossover buns, but they were too greasy today. Also, the portion of the chili fries would make anyone angry. I ordered these after I saw a photo on Yelp and I don't know if they were running low on fries, but they were definitely not the same as the other Yelper's order.. My friend ordered onion rings and it looked like such a small portion compared to the burger next to it.. My friend said the food is good if we're in the area, but not worth the drive that we drove... The cashier also didn't understand English very well. When I asked her for a recommendation for their lightest beer, she didn't know what I was asking.. Bottom line: this visit was disappointing and that makes me sad.."]
['Check your patty before you take a bite!\n\nThe patty meat completely threw me off of this place. I found hard large chunks of god knows what, thick cartilage and muscles in my burger. I am guessing they grind up their meat on the premises (which is typically great), however, they must have missed all these extra bits that ended up becoming my patty.   Completely grossed me out when I took a bite and wasted $8.75 because it ended up in the garbage. I have been to many burger joints all over and have never had this experience like this.']
["Good food and fast service at a great value! Getting a burger under $5 is a rare treat. This is a very thin burger, so come expecting this or you will be disappointed.\n\nHubby got the veggie burger, which they make fresh in house (as opposed to pre-packaged) and he really enjoyed its flavor. Given that many places don't offer veggie options, let alone tasty ones that are not an afterthought, this is a huge plus.\n\nThe strawberry malt was so-so. Good enough but not worth the calorie expenditure to the point I'd order it again.\n\nThere is plenty of seating with an outdoor option that lent itself to great people watching.  \n\nWhile I'm not sure we'd seek out Flat Patties, the great value, good veggie option and fast service make it a good option to have in the Cambridge area."]
["Honestly, really not a fan of this place. My sandwich was really really greasy, and I didn't even end up eating much of it. The onion rings a friend got was really just a plate of 10 overly battered onions that weren't very good. The service was poor also - orders weren't clear and you couldn't hear anyone's name being called. Not to mention I didn't feel great the day after having it. Overall let down."]
["One of my favorite spots in Harvard for a quick, delicious bite to eat. Great burgers and chicken sandwiches. It's true the service isn't 5-stars, but this is a place-your-order-and-pick-up-your-food spot -- don't go into it with restaurant-level expectations.\n\nAlso, there's a lot more eating space just up the stairs, but the bar stools in the front windows are the best for people-watching. Some outdoor seating as well, plus all the Harvard Square plaza space."]
['After walking by this place many times, I decided to stop in, and try it out. The place is very small, they do have seating on two levels but, but even so, there is not a whole lot of place to sit down.\n\nAs for the food:\n\nI ordered a single cheeseburger, with bacon, and fries. It was not super busy when i was there, and it took them about 5-7 minutes to put everything together. Not too bad, especially considering everything was cooked right in front of my eyes. It was, perhaps, one of the better burgers I have had to date, all of the flavors come together quite nicely, and the burger stays in one piece all the way through its being eaten.\n\nThe patty was also very pleasant, cooked perfectly, not over/underdone, and still juicy and flavorful. The cheese was thick, and perfectly melted right over the patty, added to the flavor of the patty very well.\n\nThe bacon was pleasant, and I could definitely taste it, ins some other locations, when you get bacon, you know its there, but it is not always possibly to really taste it. It was, however, a little overdone.\n\nThe patty was also very pleasant, cooked perfectly, not over/underdone, and still juicy and flavorful. The cheese was thick, and perfectly melted right over the patty, added to the flavor of the patty very well.\n\nThe bun is house-made, and is very "durable." I did not encounter the problem where the burger would fall apart, or where the bottom bun would become soaked with sauce and therefore make my hands a mess. \n\nWhile there was tomato and lettuce, and I knew they were there, i couldn\'t really taste them. Perhaps they blended into the burger in such a fashion that the tastes became one, even so, I like burgers to have some fresh vegetables that can actually be tasted.\n\n"house sauce" not overpowering, very mild, and compliments the overall flavor, but since I am a lover of bold flavors, I would have liked to see it a tad bolder. if you like bold flavors, there is a station with additional condiments(like diced onion, spicy pepper of some kind, pickles, and an onion salad of sorts) and sauces (Ketchup, Mustard, Siracha) you can give your burger a little bit more of it own personality.\n\nAs for the fires, they were also house made, and taken right out of the fryer when I ordered them, so they were a little oily, but still flavorful, only thing is that they were a bit short.']
["I'm giving it 5 stars to help this place out. It has solid food guys and all of it decently priced! It's frustrating for me ordering burgers because I'm a small and slow eater but this place has a flat patty that's perfect for me! They have an awesome condiment section as well...sort of as if you were at a Mexican restaurant..but for burgers. The other items on the menu are good, too. Also, you can't beat beers on tap for $4. It's a winner! As far as other burger joints in Harvard Square; Tasty Burger is a shit hole FYI- they use about two tablespoons of mayo for no reason. Shake Shack is awesome (I used to go to the OG one in NYC a lot) but it's a chain and a different type of burger--think In n' Out but for the East Coast (except not as good) :)"]
["Excellent food.  They even gave my wife a new burger free because she forgot to order well done.  Onion rings were best I've ever had.  Light and crispy."]
["The Southwestern Chicken Sandwich is probably one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The chicken, so juicy! The jalapenos, so spicy! The chipotle sauce, so creamy! The bun, so soft and buttery! And giant for five bucks!\n\nFlat Patties is my favorite grill-based sandwich place in Harvard Square. Tasty Burger is good but always too crowded. Shake Shack makes my stomach hurt. Mr. Bartley's is gimmicky and lackluster. But Flat Patties is an honest sandwich at a killer price. It's sort of more of a takeout joint atm, as they're sharing space with the (also very good) Felipe's and their small dining room caters to clientele of both places. I find the sides--fries and onion rings--both sort of hit or miss. Sometimes they're crispy and yummy, other times soggy or oversalted. But the sandwiches are the real star in the first place!"]
["I went to this place after searching for somewhere good and cheap to eat in Cambridge.  \n\nI had the Blue burger and it was delicious! I had a blue cheese burger at another restaurant and oh man it tasted like barf!  But this place does the blue cheese right so it's not overwhelmingly gross tasting.  The fries are okay as well.\n\nFriend got the chicken sandwich. It looked delicious with the chicken cooked to that golden brown stage of perfection.\n\nService is good and the staff very friendly.\n\nWould most def recommend this place and come back again."]
["I find it strange that in a city with some extremely wonderful burgers, places like this can exist. It's just a mediocre burger. Been a long time since I've been to McDonald's but I think it might be an upgrade to flat patties."]
["The pulled pork sandwich was so spicy it accosted my taste buds the onion rings were decent. That's really all I have to say about flat patties."]
["Awesome. Awesome awesome awesome. There are several different burger places in Harvard Square, but I feel quite confident that Flat Patties is one of the best (if not THE best). It's certainly the best at its price point. Love their house-made pickles!"]
["Flat Patties is for craving true* fast food in Harvard Square. Except it's not very fast. Not as obnoxiously slow as downstairs at the Tasty Burger, but while it's great that stuff is getting cooked to order  it takes about 10 minutes or so to get my basic burger out. The burger's pretty good (shoutout to the pickle bar!) and the shakes are not too cloying (coffee malt ftw - though note the texture is a bit more liquidy). Onion rings have a lot of batter and are quite greasy.\n\n*That is, a fast-food style burger a la McD's"]
['Cheap beer and food. Better than tasty burger at a lower price. Not as polished as an atmosphere though. Take your girlfriend of two years here not a date.']
["Food: 2 Stars\nService: 2 Stars\n\nI came here for a quick burger the other day and was really disgusted by what I got. It tasted sour! I'm not sure what was going on and I thought maybe it was just a bad patty. Definitely left a bad taste in my mouth and was not impressed by the service or speed either - there were too many people and the staff wasn't able to handle it. \n\nWith so many great burger places nearby, this is not the place to go."]
['Best burgers in Harvard square.  Other than the burgers, the menu options are ok.  I was hoping for better salads and vegetarian options.']
["I have no idea what they put in these burgers but they are quite simply amazing. I got a cheeseburger. For under $5 I wasn't expecting much but the burger was ready quickly. The lettuce was fresh and crispy, the beef patty was freshly made, not from a frozen patty. The tomato was thickly cut and wasn't an end piece. Their buns are homemade and grilled with butter and some sort of spice that added quite a bit to the flavor of the burger. \nSeating was fairly limited. There were maybe 10 tables upstairs, one on the main level and some seats in front facing out the window. There are a few more tables outside. Prices are very reasonable. My two teenage boys and I were able to eat and get drinks for under $25 and were all quite full when we left. \nOverall a great little burger place unlike any other I have ever encountered."]
["With Tasty Burger, Shake Shack, and Mr. Bartley's, Harvard Square certainly has plenty of options for burger joints. You don't really need much else. Turns out that Flat Patties also exists, unbeknownst to me until the other day. But really, I wasn't missing out on much.\n\nI got the South of the Border burger, which sounded delicious. Jalapeño relish, avocado, cilantro aioli, and jack cheese- sounds like the makings of a great burger. But I was surprised at the lack of flavor when I bit into it. The burger was tasteless, and while the jalapeño relish helped somewhat, there wasn't enough of it to save the sandwich.\n\nGot some onion rings to go with it, but they were far too salty. I saw the woman behind the counter dump a whole bucketload of salt on them as they were being prepared. Gross! They were almost inedible.\n\nI came to Flat Patties hoping to discover yet another place to grab a good burger in Harvard Square. But I only ended up leaving wishing I had gone to good old reliable Tasty Burger instead."]
['Nothing special here. Onion rings are hand breaded and pretty good. The European burger was ok. Thin patty, super thin slice of cheese, and a pretty good aioli. The strawberry milkshake was more like strawberry milk because it was so thin...definitely not worth the extra money.']
['After visiting Harvard we decided to get a quick bite to eat.  Flat patties looked fine.  We had a hamburger and grilled chicken.  Service was slow as there were 4 staff there and we were the only ones in line and it took them a long time to take our order after they were finished chatting.  Food was ok nothing spectacular.  But it was inexpensive compared to other places in the neighborhood.']
["Pretty cheap place. You kinda get what you expect to some extent, it's been voted best burger place under $10, and I think that's what this place does well.\n\nThe burgers make me thing of an upgraded shake shack. I mean, they're good, have lots of options available, but miss that nice thick patty I usually enjoy in a burger (which you usually get for over $10). Fries were good, and so was the burrito. I'd say I prefer burritos to be a bit bigger.\n\nAll in all, a good place to have lunch while you're in Cambridge and it's one of our go-to places in the area."]
["THE BEST BURGER I'VE EVER HAD. hands down. That beef blasted me into the next millennium. Double cheeseburger with a few spicy onions?!?! Big portion. I almost had to lay down."]
['Fairs only fair: I returned after my original scathing review and experienced full 360 in service: lovely counter person  and the meals (including a half decent Asian chicken chopped salad) did the trick. Still love the location and this time we got quick service with a cute smile.\n\n +2 stars, props.']
["Deal city, Flat Pattys is the mayor. $3.50 craft brews, $5.50 for a legitimately scrumptious special sandwich. That's right, scrumptious. And I don't throw that word around either. Line can get intimidating during lunch hour, but fret not my friend, it moves fast and it's worth it. No wifi and not a ton of seating, but let's not get greedy people. Excited to try the whole menu."]
["Double cheeseburger was 8.5/10, their onion rings 7/10 and their business practices a 2/10. While visiting the area I ate there on NOVEMBER 14th and the charge just hit my account today, December 11, 2015! 27 days it took them to charge me!? That just doesn't sound right.  Card users beware."]
["Step aside Tasty Burgers, Shake Shacks and Five Guys of the area, because Flat Patties is by far and away the best burger for under $10. The lightly toasted brioche buns, thin patties and tons of options for condiments and additives, make for the most exciting burger around. \n\nSeating may be sparse, but the staff is more than okay with you taking your plates outside to enjoy the Harvard square nightlife.\n\nIf the long (though quick) lines aren't enough of an indication, I'll sum it up for you: Go to Flat Patties. Get a burger. Save your remaining cash for those shoes you want. Enjoy a life without regrets. Have a good one."]
['We were in town for PAX East and hopped the T to Cambridge.  After a short walk around Harvard, hunger began to set in so the choice was made for something hot.  And Flat Patties won.\n\nI ordered "The Forager" with sautéed mushrooms, Swiss cheese and horseradish sauce for a scant $5.25!  I added bacon because c\'mon, how can you enjoy Swiss + mushrooms on a burger without their friend bacon?  It can\'t be done plus it was only $0.75 more bringing my grand total to six bucks for an excellent burger.\n\nI could have skipped the fries though.  They weren\'t as crisp as I\'d like and were a bit wiggly.  I did grab a drink that I hadn\'t seen before - a product called MASH from Boylan\'s bottling company.  It was 20 ounces of grapefruity awesomeness and less than 100 calories for the entire bottle.  It was the perfect complement to my lunch.\n\nStreet parking if any and a bathroom that was clean if not difficult to get into.  There\'s upstairs seating that didn\'t seem to be accessible except by stairs.  Some counter seating downstairs too but the majority of patrons seemed to order takeaway.  I would definitely return if I was in the area.  I suppose that means the next time I\'m in Boston for PAX East, I get some Flat Patties!']
["Tried the veggie burger recently and thought it was pretty good. It is clearly made in house and served simply with shredded lettuce, a tomato slice and Flat Patties' burger sauce on a toasted soft bun. \n\nI also tried the fries. The fries are decent, hand cut, skin on, mostly crispy, a bit greasy. The portion seemed fair for the $2 price tag.\n\nThere is a little condiments station where you can get chopped onions, pickles, jalapeños, ketchup, etc.\n\nI will also note for vegans that the burger sauce seemed like a thousand island/big mac type sauce. My guess is it that it probably is a mixture of ketchup and mayonnaise and is therefore not vegan. You may want to ask about the sauce before ordering if you're vegan.\n\nService was quick and friendly."]
["This is definitely my favorite place in Harvard Square for a burger.\n\nIt's not a big burger, but it's only $6.  Full disclosure: the meat is not the best.  If that is the most important factor for you, go spend twice as much at Bartley's.  I love Flat Patties partly because the bun is buttered and grilled.  It really makes the burger.  With that being said, it's not nearly as good when you get it to go because the trapped steam makes the bun chewy."]
["I got a south of the border burger the flavor has a kick but it was a little salty maybe mine was just oversalted... But for the price it's a pretty fulling burger. This place is pretty small there is seating on top but during busy time there is definitely a wait! I also got the cheese fries and it was good!!! I would recommend the cheese fries the cheese is actual quality cheese and it is scalding hot when it comes out. There is only one private bathroom so you may have to wait a bit also there are not many tables so if you want a group to come here it's not such a good idea!"]
['So, this review is based on multiple visits. First off, I have had very mixed experiences with Flat Patties. I work right around the corner and often will eat at my desk when I\'m busy, the first two times that I went to Flat Patties I got my food to go. \n\nThe first time I ordered a standard cheeseburger with the Flat Patties Sauce and fries. I was excited because I love burgers and I figured the "Sauce" was similar to the Tasty Burger sauce (most burger places seem to imitate the Big-Mac sauce or something similar) - when I unwrapped the burger it was very soggy (bun is already moist and being wrapped with all the heat made it very mushy) and the fries were the same. Overall extremely underwhelmed.\n\nThe second visit I got the pulled pork sandwich - to cut right to the chase it was the same experience, wasn\'t blown away by the pulled pork and the sandwich was very soggy from being wrapped with the heat. This time I got onion rings which were OK.\n\nToday I went and decided that I would order in house to see if maybe this was better than the soggy wrapped burgers previously. I ordered the Bacon Blue Burger - it was fairly good (nothing mind blowing) but definitely was a step up from previous experience. The burger was cooked well and the bun was very soft. Overall the flavor was a little bland but not unnoticeable and they gave me plenty of fries on the side.\n\nThe service was good - quick and efficient and seemed friendly enough. \n\nOverall I will go back cause I would like to give this place a higher rating and think that if you order and stay there it has a lot of potential.']
["Not your traditional burger joint. They pride themselves on topping combos you don't traditionally see. I had one with roasted peppers and it was great. It's definitely worth it if you want something a little different yet familiar at the same time."]
["Pretty good and cheap burgers in the Cambridge area - food is good, and the beer is cold. So I'm already a fan. Staff is friendly and the location gives a nice area to sit and people watch while you shove food in your face. Can't complain. If I was in the area again, I'd eat here."]
["I've always considered myself a bit of a burger expertise and I've got to say this place has amazing burgers. If I'm ever craving a good burger, I go here. The service is friendly and fast and there's a good amount of seating given the small space. The foods always fresh and the fries are mouth-watering. \nThey recently lent out half of their space to Felipe's while it was under construction, which was a bit chaotic to say the least. I'm glad that Felipe's has moved back into their own restaurant finally. \nThe only negative experience I've ever had with this place is the misspelling of my name (katrin?) but I find it a treat to see how they interpret it each time I go. I love this place, 5 stars, I highly recommend it!"]
['The menu was great! A lot to choose from, but not to confusing.  I had the "south of the border burger" and my son had the "BBQ Blue burger".  The onion rings were awesome.\nThe prices were decent for Harvard Square.\nI would recommend this place to friends and family.']
["Cheap, cheap, cheap. I got a burger with bacon and sautéed onions and mushrooms for $6. If I'd left off the extras, it would have been $4. It was a decent sized (though thin) burger, the patty a notch above fast food and the toasted bun wonderfully soft and buttery and I got it very quickly. Fast food prices in Harvard Square, but a bit higher quality. Don't expect the best burger you've ever had, but it's very satisfying when you just really want a hot burger withs some toppings for a good price."]
['I really like the Forager and the onion rings. Seating in cold/bad weather is virtually impossible for the handicapped or people who have a hard time climbing stairs, especially holding food.  When they have it, get the burger with the chimichurri sauce.']
['Cheap burgers - simple interior - limited space - fast service - average food.\n\nJust like this review: short - to the point - simple.']
['It took me two years to try Flat Patties, but I\'ll definitely be back! I was skeptical, but no more... I now know for a fact that there are amazing burgers here.\n\nThe "South of the Border" burger was cooked perfectly: juicy, tender, and super flavourful. A whole avocado for two burgers. Doesn\'t get much better than that. I was a little surprised that lettuce, tomatoes, onions, etc. don\'t just come with the burger, so now I know for next time that if I want them, I have to ask for them. No biggie. I was too busy enjoying my awesome patty... definitely a fan of the "thinner" patties, none of this gargantuan slabs of meat rolled together in an unrecognizable blob between two buns. THIS is a real burger.\n\nNot bad, Flat Patties, not bad at all.']
['Its Cheap, Its filling but the food was average.\n\nBurgers did not follow my instruction but I was too lazy to argue\n\nOvercooked patty and fried egg was overcooked too.\n\nThey should rename themselves to "Overcook Patties"']
["We chose this place because there were no really other good options nearby.  The double cheeseburger looked really good, and apparently tasted really good as well.  I got the portabella mushroom sandwich which was done very well.  I didn't really care for the buns because they were very airy and light almost like a croissant.  What I was extremely disappointed in was that they deep fry in peanut oil!  There were no signs and fortunately we asked, however, too late as we already ordered and paid."]
["It's been great the couple of times I've eaten here for dinner, my favorite burger spot. First time I ate here for lunch was a letdown."]
["Stopped in for a burger and a beer before a night out and was happily surprised. The burger was tender and juicy, nicely grilled bun although I do personally believe hat every burger should be served with lettuce and tomato ( it's the budget lover's prerogative.) the place was clean and staff was friendly."]
['We stumbled upon this burger/taco joint at 9pm. The space was loft-y (not a word) but small. It was noisy and packed. The service was fast and affordable. Perfect for a quick stop and go lunch. \n\nI ordered the "Sunday Morning" burger. The burger was assembled on a grilled soft buttered bun. Loaded with a fried egg and ham. It was juicy (a little too much for my liking) and falling apart in its drippins\'. It was lightly seasoned and borderline bland. Which could be easily remedied at the condiments station. \n\nAlthough the burger didn\'t wow me, it had all the qualities of a great burger... a little some thin\' extra would have made it into a phenomenal burger. Which, for $5.75 isn\'t too shabby.']
['Last time I was here, my burger was severely undercooked, and I got ridiculously sick from it. I took a few bites and I was like...oh crap. The manager definitely was apologetic and had the cooks cook it all over again, but I was still kind of skeptical. \n\nPlease make sure they cook your burger the way you want it to be cooked!! It was my mistake for not sending it back the second I got it. I thought the sauce on the plate was from the mayo dripping off the tomatoes...']
["Okay, Flat Patties. I think you are definitely a good addition to Harvard Square.\n\nYou aren't the most amazing burger I've ever had by far, but you are cheap and made to order and quick, and for that, I think you should be in business a while in Harvard Square. It is definitely more fun and a better overall atmosphere than other fast food ordering options in the square. I mean you have exposed brick in your interior which clearly makes you awesome and then combining that with your loft like seating area makes you pretty clever too. Plus, any place that plays Prince and MJ's Black or White as their music choices is definitely my friend. \n\nEach burger is around $5-6 and doesn't come with anything, but they are decently sized. The good thing about them is that also includes pretty high end toppings like avocado, gruyere cheese, carmelized onions, bleu cheese, mushrooms, etc. So it isn't your average burger and bun kind of spot. Fries will run you another $2 more and it is not the biggest portion of fries, so they could  be slightly more generous in that department. But really for $8 for fast made to order food in the square, Flat Patties is pretty descent. Not a super fun exciting outing, but if you are in the area for a fast bite with someone, Flat Patties has your back."]
['Double cheeseburger. Added pickles and mayo. Fries a bit salty. \n\nAwesome.']
["Chili cheese fries- BOMB! I would have preferred more fries with the order but the fries were crispy, the chili was amazingly delicious, and the cheese just melted in your mouth! \n\nVeggie burger- this was surprisingly tasty! I love the flavor it had and it was by far my favorite burger there.\n\nGrilled chicken burger- okay this was not good... healthy... but not good. There was absolutely no flavor in the grilled  chicken! Just tasted like plain chicken with lettuce and tomatoes inbetween two buns.\n\nThe chairs and tables were all upstairs so you have to come back down the stairs if they call your number! Hahah. The hot dogs looked good though, I'm going to keep that in mind."]
["The pulled pork sandwiches were great. The onion rings were pretty good too, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor"]
["I had a cheese sandwich, and it was delicious and filling without being overly greasy.  I also tried the chili cheese fries, which were pretty good as well, but I wouldn't say that you absolutely HAD to try them.  My friend had a grilled chicken sandwich, which she said she really enjoyed.\n\nOverall, pretty good for a fair price."]
["Cheeseburger and onion rings are where it's at. My son and I shared both and were completely satisfied. He loved that you can watch them make your food and the onion rings are made to order. I love that they have a jalepeno/onion/pickle bar. I think we spent around $7 and got to sit outside to enjoy the square. The staff was very pleasant. We will be back"]
['Spindrift &amp; Mash "gourmet" sodas in their fridge. \n\nSteps from the redline T (subway.) \n\nMost wallet-friendly prices on the square for burger &amp; fries-type grub. \n\nI\'m obsessed with their caesar salads, although when I don\'t ask for dressing on the side, they tend to overdress. Thankfully, the creamy, yummy dressing is worth every fat gram...same with the crunchy, buttery croutons. \n\nLove that I can get a side of fries for $1.95 &amp; it is *the perfect* portion. Thick, perfect square sticks of potato sprinkled with fat crystals of sea salt. \n\nFried cod sandwich was weirdly sweet...it was either the slaw or the tartar sauce. Probably would not get that again. Can\'t wait to try their veggie burger w/ grilled onions...&amp; their frozen custard w/ toppings... (yea, I fantasize about my next meal!) \n\nSeating upstairs &amp; downstairs. Definitely stop in for greasy, stick-to-your-ribs goodies.']
['Meh. Thin, tasteless patty. A little, and I do mean a little blue cheese, a strip of bacon and very basic barbecue sauce. The fries were utterly forgettable as well. The name says it all, Flat, period. People giving this five stars...am I missing something or have you not had a good burger? Next...']
["Our first time here. Not impressed. It wasn't a particularly busy evening, but we waited forever for two burgers, cheese fries, and onion rings. Of the two burgers, only one was even warm. The cheese fries were a pitiful handful of fries on a large plate - they looked so sad and lonely - with some shredded cheese melted on top. They were cold. The onion rings - also cold - had a nice light batter, but were so oily that I ended up having to blot them with napkins. The flavors were good, or probably would have been if they were hot, but as it was, we won't be going back. Yes, I suppose we could have returned three-quarters of the meal, waited another twenty minutes, and gotten it in shifts, like the family at the next table, but we'd already been there almost an hour.\n\nTo be fair, when I stopped on the way out and told the manager why we wouldn't be back, she did offer a refund - or rather, she asked if I was asking for my money back, which I wasn't. I just wanted to tell her why we wouldn't be returning. On the other hand, she didn't offer any sort of apology for the kitchen screwups, which would have cost her nothing.\n\nThere are too many good burgers places in Harvard Square to waste time with one so disappointing."]
["Dear Manager/owner of Flat Patties,\n\nyour burgers are delish, but you need some attention to hygiene.\n\n1. The female cashier, who had a runny nose, was repeatedly rubbing her nose, her face, her neck, etc, back over her runny nose while handling money. I almost walked out but wanted to get my money back. Ppl who do this are often unaware of it, so i'm sure her intentions were good but this is completely gross and unsanitary. Please give your staff a talking to abt hygiene and maybe I'll return.\n\n2. a few bites into a totally delish burger I found a grey hair-blech.\nThe guys making the food were total sweethearts. I assumed it was not from them as their hair was dark and was covered properly-somewhere along the line that hair got it there.\n\nMaybe this was a one time thing and it's a wonderful place. Maybe will try again later in the year, but only if I keep a close eye on my food and some purell at the register!"]
['Yes! The roast beef w/BBQ was a success. Great alternative to a burger. Newly converted to the roast beef sandwiches here!']
["Went there last night and DID NOT like it.  The food was not good. I didn't even finish my burger (which is something I never do).  The burger was tasteless.  The bun was mushy.  The chocolate shake was lame.  I've had better chocolate milk!  There were barely any fries on the plate.  I don't get why so many people rave about this.  U Burger is WAY better.  Five Guys is better.  Even MacDonald's is better.\nAnd on top of all that; the layout of the restaurant was terrible.  It was way too cramped.  I was there at 6:30 on a Tuesday night.  It wasn't crowded - it was cramped.  We had to get up from our seats while waiting for our food every time someone needed to use the restroom.  To go to the upstairs dining room you have to wait while people come down.  it was nearly impossible to fit through the tiny maze of tables.  I will not be going back."]
["Every individual item is cheap, but it adds up fast (for a burger, fries, drink). I love their burgers and their Asian salad -- every time I'm in the square, I'll stop by flat patties!"]
["Some of the best fast burgers I've had anywhere.  Quick, delicious.  And they have beer, too!  Truth be told, I'll take a flat quarter-pounder with interesting toppings over an over-sized bar burger any day.  If you're super-hungry, you could eat two.  Or split one as a two-person snack.  Chill upstairs or sit by the windows and enjoy."]
['Delicious food, reasonable prices! Had the chicken sandwich with fresh cut fries. Food was hot and service was speedy. Highly recommend.']
["Greasy greasy. Probably the greasiest fries I've had in a long time. A bit too soggy. I'd skip the fries, truly.\n\nThe burgers are a notch above your average joe burger. I dug the Sunday Morning, as the tomato jam was really special. The Border burger had some awesome cilantro aioli that did the trick to step it up.\n\nService was slow, though, and the music was cheesy."]
["I am giving this place 2 stars because I saw the owner mistreating the workers--he was breathing down their neck, exasperating them and criticizing in front of customers. A place that doesn't treat their workers right is not a place I can support. \n\nIn terms of the food: The prices are good--on the less expensive side. The food is good but the portions are very small."]
['The last three burgers have been severely undercooked.  When I order it well done and I see the cashier type in WELL DONE, it should come out WELL DONE.  I even complained and was told that "we cook our burgers medium."  Well, what is the point of me telling the cashier WELL DONE and having her type it in only to have my burger come back PINK in the middle. I like my burgers well cooked.  \n\nI do not deserve the attitude that I got from the man that was making the burgers, especially since I had raved about this place for months and told hundreds, yes, hundreds of people about Flat Patties.\n\nI don\'t even feel like going back because of the attitude that I got.  \n\nIt\'s too bad to lose a customer and potential others when a simple, "I\'m sorry, we will refund you." would have helped a lot.  Yeah, they offered to remake the burger for me.   But, at that point I was just grossed out.\n\nI also found it odd that the cashier had to tell the guy making the burger, show him and tell him that it did say well done and he said "it didn\'t say that on the ticket."  I know it does because I have a receipt that indicateds WELL DONE.\n\nUgh.  I feel like I just broke up with a boyfriend.']
["I just devoured their fried fish sandwich. The tartar sauce is still smeared across my face and there is coleslaw in my lap. But nonetheless I feel compelled to write a review right here on my iPhone: That was one hell of a tasty sandwich. I am dazed, blisses out, floating in a fishy, flaky, tangy afterglow.\n\nGod damn.\n\nCan't wait to go back and try their burger.\n\nActually, I may go for round two right now..."]
["I was skeptical after reading some not so great reviews, but I really enjoyed my meal at Flat Patties.  \n\nWe went in and noticed the only low (not bar height) table on the first floor was occupied, and they don't have an elevator to the seating on the second floor.  The management asked the guys sitting at the table to move upstairs so I could sit at the table.  He then took our order while he recommended burgers and beers.  I got the gruyere and caramelized onions burger with a side of fries.  The food showed up super fast, and the burger was awesome.  Great flavors, amazing bun that was just the right amount of buttery deliciousness.  I also tasted my friends swiss and mushroom burger, and that was great, too!  The fires are good, not great.  I liked mine thin and well done - only a few were that way.  Two burgers, two order of fries, and a beer for $20?  Sounds good to me!"]
['1.22.16 ate here and now have norovirus.  Trying to determine origin and this seems most likely given other food eaten and no one else I know sick.  Anyone else not doing well after eating here?']
["tasty burgers like the fast food days of yore, when fast food joints still served items that could be labeled as food and not be lying.\n\nFlat patties is super convenient and cheap for Harvard Sq.  Tasty juicy burger, get it in a single or a double. Thin cut crispy fries.   They have a nice selection of burger topping combinations, or you can do it yourself.  The whole assortment of deep fired appetizers/sides are available (cooked in peanut oil), as well as some non fried sandwich and salad options.  \n\nBest things in my opinion, they have a little topping bar, and they have pickled jalapenos!! whoo hoo.  Homemade frozen custard!  Heck ya!! and milk shakes, malted or not.\n\nEverything's cooked to order.  The staff is nice, I think the owner came by while I was waiting and asked how's it going.  Good place, I'll be going back when I want a quick burger fix."]
["DISGUSTING. I would NEVER recommend this place for a burger. It was soggy and very bland. I went around 2pm, so it wasn't that busy. The staff were fooling around behind the counter, and offered the worst customer service."]
['Great pulled pork sandwhich and a fantastic value! Sandwhich, fries, and a beer for right about 10 bucks!']
["So given that this place has many many reviews on their product I will add that the staff was very nice, welcoming and pleasant...the fresh cut fries did not hurt either.\nWho doesn't love a good burger?"]
['Hard to rate a burger place so poorly but Flat Patties is well below par. \n\nOrder taker needs to know the menu. Tried to order a "homemade" pickle which is clearly displayed on menu board but want known to order taker. Also, pickle is not homemade. When I eventually showed someone their own menu I was given a pickle out of a big jar you can probably buy at Costco.\n\nOrdered cheeseburger but got no cheese. Burger is fairly flavorless. Meat is too thin for good flavor and seasoning is too weak.']
["SUCH an upgrade from its days in the Garage - delicious, fresh, fast food. I've had great luck with their french fries, as well as their burgers (fresh, crispy grilled buns). While their less-than-healthy fare is quite good, the Asian chicken salad leaves a bit to be desired (weirdly salty). When they first opened up at their new location, I also was a HUGE fan of their milkshakes - always super thick and flavorful - but the last few times I've gone, I feel like I'm just drinking a chocolate milk (not quite the ideal milkshake experience). The frozen custard is pretty tasty though, especially with any of the toppings - I'd definitely go back for that alone.\n\nI had trouble deciding on a star rating for this place, because a few recent experiences have been inconsistent from my earlier trips here (at the new location), but I'm still a faithful fan, and will continue to return for what I consider to be Harvard Square's freshest 'fast food.'"]
["Glad to report that on giving Flat Patties another visit, we were very happy with everything we got. We ordered two burgers on this visit; a South of the Border burger which was worth ordering just for the jalapeño relish and a Swiss Gruyere burger with caramelized onions and rosemary aioli. Both burgers were well cooked, well seasoned, delicious throughout. \n\nFor a side, we did the chili/cheese fries again and my previous concern with salt content has been rectified. Quite delicious.\n\nWe left happy, full, and certain that we'll return again."]
["Delicious burgers and fries. And chicken. It's fast food but it's awesome.\n\nService is okay, everything in general is decent.\n\nThis place competes with Tasty Burger, in my opinion. They're both great, but I have to say this place has the better burgers."]
['I have heard great reviews about this place, but I really do not enjoy the hamburgers there. The buns taste weird, as well as the cheese. The fries are super greasy and I did not even eat them. The food is edible, but I would not choose to go here.']
['I just had an amazing burger (a huge, gourmet In N Out double-double, sadly not animal style, for you west coasters out there) and a nice pour of beer (BBC Steel Rail - a solid standby for me) for less than $12 including a small tip. For Harvard Square, land of $10 lunch sandwiches and overpriced drinks, this is a jewel of a place. \n\nNo, there isn\'t much "ambiance" and no, the beer wasn\'t a full pint (but definitely worth its $3 price tag!), but again, for where it is and the solid burgers they have, I\'m so happy it\'s here.']
['They have great burgers and even better milkshakes! The strawberry one is their best. \n\nThis place is great. People is always helpful and smiling, ambiance is nice (they are playing Latin music most of the time) , their buttered buns have a great taste and their guacamole and peppers are always fresh and flavorful. Bacon is a must on every burger. The best part, you get all this for just a few bucks. \n\nI would encourage them to improve their overall cleanliness though. Dirty dishes are always piling in front of the register and you can always find trash in the floor.']
['What a great find.  For six bucks, you can get a hearty burger and (not-so) small order of fries.    The food is made to order.  \n\nMy burger was delicious and the fries were small and well-seasoned.']
["I like a great burger and fries. This isn't the place for it. Haphazard attitute toward what they cook, how they serve it and no regard for customer preference. Stay away if you're trying to impress someone.\n\nIf you like your food slapped into a plate and a shrug of the shoulders when they get your order wrong - then this place is for you."]
["Good sandwiches but it is sharing a space with a burrito company. Their grilled cheese sandwich was awesome but they didn't have any tomato soup to go with it. That is like giving someone chocolate chip cookies or brownies with no milk!!!!"]
["Best quick burgers in Harvard square.  Great bread, the burgers are thin but juicy, and they have a good variety of specialty ingredient options.  I've eaten here a few times, and it's been great each time."]
['Great burgers overall with a very nice serve staff. The food was terrific and reasonably priced. The food came out at a reasonable rate and tasted very fresh.']
["I'm endeavoring to do a Harvard Square burger tour, since it now looks like I can't spit around here without hitting a burger place. (This used to be true about book stores, but, yeah, times have changed, ain't they?) At one time it was only Mr &amp; Mrs Bartley's (the distaff disappeared a few years ago), with the usual outliers like The Tasty and Charlie's and Brighams doing burgers as part of the regular lunch items. And then burgers became hip, and Craigie's is still tops. Anyway, managed to begin this with Flat Patties, and, have to say, you know, sometimes Wendy's should be a benchmark for a double cheeseburger, because the one at Flat Patties was a bit of awful. Firstly, it was _wet_, both with an unsatisfying sauce, and also with not properly prepared and dried lettuce and tomato. Seriously, big fail. So, on to the next. Hopefully one a week."]
["Pretty darn good burger and fries. Maybe a bit skinny on the patty to bun ratio. Apparently the buns are made in house. I recommend it because it's one of those places people recommend and I like a burger and trying the burger places that locals recommend. I say GOOD but not great. Very crowded at lunch time and they serve beer."]
["I almost don't care what the burger tastes like. We got a cheeseburger, a southwest burger, two orders of regular fries, and two yuenglings for $18.99. In Harvard. Who gets a full meal for $19?? It's small and hot inside, and tables were messy, but the place was overall clean. Currently sharing a place with the Mexican place next door, which I only see as an added bonus. Oh and on top of that, the food was great!!! Delicious!!! Will be returning!!"]
["Nice atmosphere, reasonable prices. I paid $7 for a garden salad plus chicken. At the same time I felt the salad had too much dressing. Ask them to put it on the side if you don't feel like eating 200ml of mayo dressing. Will go back for the burgers that looked delicious."]
["In short - burgers are tasty but the fries suck. \n\nIf you're in a pinch and need a quick bite, sure! stop in... but be warned, the fries suck."]
["Good burgers and low prices, need I say more?\n\nTheir location in Harvard Sq. is beautiful! I love the ambiance and decor, it's a really good looking burger shop.  The fries were ok, I little too oily for my taste, next time I'll try the onion rings.  I loved the burger and kinda wish I got the double but for the price ($8.08 for burger, fries and a drink) I was really pleased with my experience.  Good work Flat Patties!"]
['Another stopped in on a whim place. Burgers were great, the fries were droopy, and the onion rings needed more spice. Not bad for a casual lunch while we walked around the square.']
['Fresh, tasty burgers. Inexpensive joint. Clean and cosy. A little too tight if I may.Great cheese fries.\nFrozen custard: Soft, creamy, inexpensive and very addictive!']
['Great! Just what I needed. Perfectly greasy. Cheese burger and chilli cheese fries and grilled cheese all super tasty. The guy at the register is cute but sorta slow. 5 stars cause it is exactly what fast food should be!']
["Flat patties. How do I go about describing the good, the bad, and the ugly with you. \n\nLets first start off with some of the good. \n\nThe location is really quite great. Any time I'm passing through Harvard and my lady friend and I want to grab a bite to eat, simple, no hassle, we more often than not make a stop here. For the first few times I ordered the chicken sandwich with fries. Not only is it flat patties, its also flat chicken. Which, I'm a pretty big fan of. \n\nI don't like it when my chicken sandwich is so bulky it all just falls apart in my hands. I also need to be able to pick it a part a little. \n\nThis past visit I had a cheeseburger for the first time. Well done, just the way I like it and covered in ketchup. Nom, nom.\n\nI like being able to sit above everything and people watch. Especially when it gets a little busy and you can watch everyone put condiments on their sandwiches like some McDonald's Burglar waiting for them to put their patty down to snatch it. Or maybe thats just me. \n\nNow a little of the bad. While the fries are pretty delicious, they are super skinny and oily. I like my fry to have a little thickness to it to make it easier when it comes to scooping up the ketchup. I have to put 4 together just to feel a little satisfied. \n\nThe ugly. I have yet to see if this place has a bathroom. If it does, its hidden behind a cooler and underneath some stairs. Sketch, I think so."]
["I'm salivating just thinking about their burger. Phenomenal food for a fantastic price."]
["I love this place. (Even more than nearby Tasty Burger and Shakeshack.) I've been coming here since when they used to be in the Garage in Harvard Square years ago. The usual things I almost always order are the portabella mushroom sandwich with avocado, a regular hamburger, or their fish sandwich and a side of chili cheese fries. The buns that they use here are perfectly buttered and their house sauce is delicious. This place is one of the more affordable options in Harvard Sq. There is ample seating downstairs and upstairs. The staff is always friendly and helpful. Stop by here if you're looking for a quick and cheap bite!"]
['Had a quick bite to eat here, the sign for breakfast was still outside, so I was hoping to grab some bacon and eggs, but it was past 12.  I ended up having their pulled pork sandwich and I really enjoyed it.  Quick, cheap and tasty.\n\nI was the off to the subway.  I sat down and realized I was missing something!  I forgot my shopping bag at Flat Patties!  I panicked and got off the subway and ran back. Luckily it was still there... I want to thank those who worked that day for keeping it safe until I returned.']
["Eh... it wasn't all that. I ordered a cheese burger. N it tasted N looked like something I could have made at home"]
["The burger was fine and the fish and chips were good.  The beer was nicely priced, can't do much better in the Square."]
['All I\'ve wanted for months is a burger, fries and an old-fashioned black and white milkshake. When I saw a burger place that made milkshakes, I thought this would be the place to satisfy my craving. It wasn\'t.\n\nTheir burgers sounded great, and the milkshakes absolutely divine. However, when it came time to order, the girl working the counter was ridiculously rude. I asked for a "black and white" shake, and when she said "huh?" I explained it was vanilla with a swirl of hot fudge. She then said "umm...okay we\'ll try it." Then she kept glaring at me and whispering to one of how co-workers how "demanding" I was, and that I probably was not the type to leave a tip even after requesting weird things. Ya, let me leave a tip for the sullen girl behind the cash register who took my money and order and then spent the next five minutes staring daggers at me...\n\nAs for the food, the burger was pretty great and the fries were decent. But the shake was overblended and water thin. There is a lot of potential to this restaurant, and if I hadn\'t felt as though the staff would defecate in my shake for asking it to be made thicker, the shake would\'ve been decent as well. It\'s too bad the people who work here are too busy talking about their customers and rolling their eyes every five seconds to make sure the food is good quality.']
["UPDATE 4/1/16:  Eek what happened?  Went to FP last week and the burger I got was bland, the bun was SUPER soggy, and the fries were only OK.  Service is the same.  Dare I say Shake Shack is about to become my go-to burger joint in Harvard Square??\n\nFrom 8/2013: Awesome burgers - always juicy.  Fries are good too - maybe a little too salty for some, but I like them.  Cute loft seating area.  Fast service most of the time, although I'm taking a star off because often, you're not really acknowledged for a minute or two if they're busy (just say hi and that you'll be right with me! I won't bite, I promise!)."]
["Amazing gourmet burgers for extremely decent prices! It's right in the heart of Harvard Square. My friend and I were looking for something fast and light before heading out to Boston. This place was perfect!\n\nWhen you walk in the store itself seems like just the kitchen, cashier, and line. There's  a small section for window seating, and several outdoor tables. I think I saw a dining area upstairs but didn't actually go up so no advice there. \n\nEverything is self-serve so if you need something ask. Otherwise utensils and condiments on the back wall across from the cashier. Service is pretty fast.\n\nAgain, pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food. Im sure everything tasted as good as it sounded. If I am in the area again, I would definitely come back to Flat Patties."]
['Is it possible to give no stars??\n\nI take great care to be courteous when ordering, regardless if it\'s L\'Espalier or a hot dog stand.  Went to Flat Patties a couple of weeks ago on a break from biking with my son.  Waited in line and placed our order.\n\nThe b behind the counter (it said Brittany on the receipt) says rudely, "you\'re talking too fast, I can\'t understand your order".  WTF??  I wanted to rip her a new one, but wanted to set a new example for my son (7 yo) , so I repeated the order - maintaining a smile and courtesy.\n\nThe rest of the transaction was no better. Brittany had a frown the whole time.  She asked the standard questions like, "for here or to go" and "would you like a receipt", but every word came off nasty.\n\nThe woman in line after us had issues with Brittany as well and had some words for her.\n\nTo be fair, that was my second time at Flat Patties.  My son and I stopped in the weekend prior and had a nice experience, but as a new(ish) burger joint in Harvard Square (or at least in a more prominent location - didn\'t know they existed before) you would think they would work hard to establish their brand.  Is it that hard to be nice???\n\nPS. Can\'t confirm, but I suspect her, "you\'re talking too fast" has something to do with my being Asian.']
['Mmm, Flat Patties is definitely one of the first places that I think of when I\'m craving a burger. I don\'t know what it is, but the way they wrap that burger in the foil wrapper... it makes the burger seem to taste even more delicious. \n\nIt\'s not your gourmet-style burger, where the bun takes up 1/3 of the burger. The buns are pretty flat, which I prefer because then you get more of the meat flavor. The cheese is perfectly melted and dripping down the side. \n\nOh, and you have to get the onion rings. They\'re, again, not gourmet-style that are breaded an inch thick. Rather, they\'re crispy and thinly sliced. The perfect complementary side to your burger. \n\nPlenty of seats to sit there and eat, or you can take it home but watch out for people who start following you because of the delicious smells that\'ll be coming from that brown paper bag. I encountered plenty of people who stopped me and asked, "Wow, what is IN that bag? It smells delicious." I answer, "My dinner from Flat Patties," and quickly sprint away.']
["I definitely agree with Ina C. that this place was ridiculously overly air-conditioned. I was freezing by the end of our meal.\n\nThis was not the greatest meal I've had in the Boston area.  First of all, we were there at a slow time, yet our burger orders came out wrong.  Plus, I'm not really in the thin-patty camp, and the fries were just greasy.\n\nI wish I would have tried the homemade frozen custard!  That sounded very promising!"]
["Love this place. Besides the fact that it's super busy during rush hours(which is a given) this place has great food that just melts in your mouth. Anyone who likes quesadillas should definitely come here. Plus they have great lemonade, definitely coming here again."]
["Excellent. Cute and quaint little place, came in during a Tuesday lunchtime. Me and my friend each had a quesadilla which were cheap and very tasty (much better than what I've had at chipotle or qdoba). \n\nNice seating, sat upstairs. Very happy."]
["Hands down the best fast food burger in Boston\nBetter than Uburger, Four Burgers, 5 Guys and Tasty Burger and Ive tried them all..\nGot the:\n-Cheese burger with roasted green chills, jack cheese and sauté onions..\nbun is fresh and has a nice crunch from getting warmed on the grill, burgers has a nice crunch too it as well with high heat quick cook on the grill. burger cooked perfectly.\nDidn't get fries but they looked good too. \nThey need to get a second location because they are in the heart of Harvard Sq with no easy way to get there if you aren't walking in the square. We just happened to walk by and went in because I have read so much about it."]
["I came here with 3 others and there is a good amount of seating, best for parties of 4 or less. Two floors, upstairs is just all tables and downstairs is where you order and some seating. You can stare out into the street there. I WOULD HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS PLACE! There is no big sign above the place, just an empty sign and of kourse there was construction blocking this...\n\nI am soo glad I came! I have been deprived of the great american burger for over 6 months since i've been in asia so this experience was even better than average. So! For about 9 dollars, i got a DOUBLE cheese burger with special sauce with (added extras) sauteed mushrooms and bacon (mmm) and a mango nantucket nectar. THe burger was huge!! You know when you see a big mac poster on a mcdonalds ad? YEAH legit it was that size! EVERY bite was amazing......It was...pretty greasy i must admit..but it was so good.\n\nI am ready to return whenever! Soo good. Nice place to talk to! the AC WAS NOT too cold! It was really hot outside, i was relieved to be inside here :)"]
["Flat Patties is a great burger joint, definitely in my top 5 in Cambridge. I have been there many times and ordered a bunch of different things, from the roast beef sandwich to the BBQ Blue burger, and they are all delicious. The sauce that they put on the regular burgers is awesome, and very similar to Shake Shack's sauce, but I'd say Flat Patties' is better. It's nice to have a place in town that you can tell is homemade, and the cooks are very detail oriented, as you can see because the flat top is right in the middle of the restaurant. Each burger is made to order ingredient by ingredient, and it shows in the food.\n\nThe only reason that Flat Patties didn't get 5 stars is because the burgers have the tendency to be a little on the salty side, but that's totally fine when you can wash it down with one of the draft beers they have on tap!"]
["Flat Patties has this whole health farm to table vibe going, but the burgers just don't measure up. Mine was kind of dry, not much flavor and has some grizzle in the patty. Overall, between the burger and the fries, it was pretty average. Shake Shack is 2 blocks away - Also average, but they have shakes."]
['Amazing Hamburgers and Grilled Cheese Sandwich!  Glad we stopped by!  Ordered and sat outside to people watch.  Great place!']
['This is a great cheap place for good food, probably one of the only ones in this expense republic. Burgers are awesome, especially the breakfast one which has egg and cheese on it - ! Burritos are good too, just a regular burrito, nothing special, but cheap tasty. YUENGLING on tap for $3 last I checked. Is that insane? I bet the price goes up soon...like everything else in Cambridge. Oh well.']
['Hands down my favorite place for burgers in Harvard Square.\nThe buns are toasty, the burgers are juicy and the special sauce is actually quite good.  Two bun tops keep the bottom half of your sandwich intact and your clothing clean.']
["No Stars if I could!! This was awful. Some Boston publication gave it best burger. They are crazy. I won't even talk about poor ambiance, not able to see menu when ordering. The thin single burger was quite pink, not cooked at all. I waited about 10 minutes and it wasn't busy, so they had time to cook it. I didn't have time to wait for another, I ate around the edges but it was pink right to the edges. Today I was sick. Not unexpected. The onion rings were lauded by staff, they were only OK in quality but way too salty. They were thicker than I prefer, the batter was crisp, but every bite was a salt lick. I noticed the plate was covered with salt. The drink dispenser said refills were 50 cents, but the water didn't work. I was parched. I would never go back. I'll take UBurger as best in Boston any day.  I'll go to Shake Shack, or even 5Guys. They all know how to cook their burgers, don't oversalt their food. All have better setting and free refills. Don't believe what you read.."]
["This is like an inferior version of In-N-Out. The patties were slightly saltier than I would have liked. The service was not friendly, as expected from a fast food place. If this is the best burger in Harvard then it's pretty sad."]
['Went for dinner last night on a whim as my fiance and I were walking around the area.  While the place is small, I really liked the atmosphere.  There is bar seating by the window downstairs and a table or two, and a few more tables up on a loft.  We ordered at the counter, then grabbed a seat upstairs.  When they called our name, we went downstairs and got our food, not really a big deal.\n\nThey had three beers on tap, and each was only $2-$3 each, which is a pretty killer deal for beer.  I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which came with coleslaw on a buttered, grilled roll.  It had great flavor and the home made roll was delicious.  On the side I had onion rings which were perfectly cooked and crispy.  Could have used a touch more salt, but that is easily added.  \n\nMy fiance got the South-of-the-Border burger.  He thought it was unique and delicious.  On the side he had fries, which were cooked crispy and had a good natural potato flavor.\n\nNo, the portions are not huge, but neither is the price.  Honestly, I thought it was a perfect sized portion and not huge and overkill like so many other places today.\n\nWe got a burger, pulled pork, side of fries, side of onion rings, beer and a soda for about $20.\n\nWe also tried a chocolate malt on our way out.  Could have been a touch thicker, but still absolutely delicious.  We will certainly come back.']
['I really enjoy Flat Patties. They make a great thin patty burgers as their name suggests. They grill their buns so they are toasted to perfection and they are one of the few places I know that can put fresh avacado on their burgers.']
["I'm thrilled I finally tried Flat Patties last night. I was babysitting and the little guys just BEGGED for dinner there, so I figured, why not? We ordered up a few burgers, some fries to share and a couple drinks. MAN, those burgers! As expected the patties are thin, and that's definitely my preference. They were juicy and full of flavor without being undercooked. The kids ate like champs and we all enjoyed the outdoor seating and people watching in a bustling area of the square. I'll be back, sans kids, in the near future I'm sure."]
['Really good burger, but I suggest the double to get the proper burger to bun ratio. They had self serve condiments and the Homemade pickles are pretty good, sliced thin so you can pile them on. Handcut fries on point. Almost as good as 5 Guys... Almost']
["Popped in here before a show on a Friday night since there was no way we'd be able to get in and out of anywhere else. Was impressed with the variety of options for toppings, but not very impressed with the burgers themselves. Seemed like those frozen 'Bubba burgers', and though I asked for very well done and said they could leave it on longer than my companion's, mine was decidedly medium well. Pink makes me queasy.\n\nBuns aren't big enough to encompass the (yes, flat) patty, so the whole shebang is incredibly messy. Fries were pretty good -- thin shoestring-- and did appear to be made from real potatoes. \n\nI am giving a third star because they seem relatively eco-conscious; they encourage re-usable dishware (allowing you to take it out to their few wrought-iron tables or across the sidewalk to the concrete benches of Brattle Square!) and condiments were in refillable dispensers, not packets. Perhaps choosing a new bun which can hold the patty, and listening more carefully to customer requests about how the patty is grilled, would elevate this place."]
["I went here for the first time today, and had the mushroom, swiss, onion and horseradish sauce burger and a root beer float. My burger was good, but the bun was extremely soggy and greasy, and it fell apart almost instantly. I ended up eating everything with a fork. \n\nThe interior is extremely cramped. There is an upstairs seating area, but there is no elevator. I'm not sure how they can claim that this place is wheelchair accessible. I certainly wouldn't recommend it for anyone with any kind of mobility issues, and I most likely won't be back."]
["The burgers aren't bad for $4.00. Toppings are tasty. The onion rings are good, the fries are lousy (as mentioned previously).\n\nDon't speak Espanol? You will have play charades and point a lot to make sure your order is processed correctly. Last time in, I got a burger with unwanted Russian dressing on the bottom and had to repeat my order a few times to the presumably undocumented alien behind the counter. Luckily, I was too hungry and in a hurry to comlain, and the burger was actually pretty good anyway.\n\nDrink lots of water if eating the fries or you'll get cotton-mouth, as these taters are bathed in salt."]
["The food isn't really amazing or anything, but it's good enough and it's right on Harvard Square and the prices are good. I like sitting on the upstairs part."]
["Not bad. Nothing super special. I had the South of the border burger because as a Los Angelino temporarily in exile in Boston, I was hankering for avocados-- which were the high-point of the burger. The jalapeño relish wasn't spicy at all. Thankfully they had a caddy full of fresh diced onions and jalapeños to add, but overall the burger was nothing super special, nor was it offensive.\n\nThey had a good selection of soda (Boylan Grape!) and a few other menu options I was deciding between, so maybe I'll give it another shot."]
['Thanks to my Yelp friend Melissa M. I discovered this wonderful world of delicious fast food! I\'ve only tried the veggie burgers and french fries (and their homemade lemonade), but they are SO GOOD!! I normally don\'t get to go to Harvard Square for lunch, sadly, and am also on a diet. So I can only come here on my Saturday "cheat" days now . . . on my non-cheat days I daydream about those yummy veggie burgers and fries. I gotta get myself over there on a Saturday soon . . .']
['I like the bans and a big fan of "Santa fe" burger. The combination of big green chili and burger is nice.']
["Try their root beer float!  The ice cream is so good- such a treat.  I've tried their hamburgers and roast beef as well- their BBQ sauce isn't anything to write home about but the burger was AMAZING!  This place have never let me down and is our go-to place for a nice Friday treat. :)  The layout is a bit weird though and if you catch them during a rush, it's tough to navigate through the place.  \n\nThe food is goooooooood though. :)"]
['Eh. There are much better burger places all around...\n\nI thought the food was kind of overpriced. You have to pay additional for any toppings or doodads or bells, whistles, french fries, etc. It seemed like this place was more about the trend than the food.']
["Objectively, Flat Patties is pretty A-OK. I want to love this place but it tends to be packed anytime I go in and I end up taking my grub on the run. That's fine, but a 15 minute old cheeseburger tends to weep through it's bun and create burger soup in wax paper nest. This is of course , something that I can get over, but - it's a pain. \n\nThe food. Yes. Burgers, chicken sand's, salads. Salads you say? Who cares! Agreed. I really do like the burgers, my only critique would be that they tend to be sort of salty. I dunno. I tend to not be salty, or that is better said as, I prefer not to salt shit. Well. Except for their fries. I like salt on their fries. \n\nOh. \n\nThe pickles. \n\nSwooooon.\n\nCan a man swoon over pickles?"]
['This is our go-to cheap takeout from Harvard Sq. The food is good and the prices are right. \n\nMy personal favorite is the BBQ Blue ($5.50!): a fatty, decadent treat of Blue Cheese, house BBQ sauce &amp; bacon. I devour this burger. On a "cheat" day, of course.\n\nHusband likes a good old-fashioned grilled cheese. ($3.25! add bacon/ham or other stuff for .75 or .50, respectively)\n\nThe onion rings are ok. I think the time I ordered them the onions were a bit too crunchy/maybe not fully cooked. The fries are tasty. \n\nThey also have homemade frozen custard! Haven\'t gotten around to tasting this yet, but once the summer comes...\n\nLove this place and will continue to pop by when in the mood for a good burger/sandwich.']
['A little heavy on the grease for me, but peanut oil does make almost anything taste delicious.  There are a few tables outside when the weather is nice that provide some good people watching!']
['A gorgeous "look-at-me-it\'s-almost-spring" day tempted us to wander over to Flat Patties to see what Melissa M has been raving about this whole time. It\'s got a good location in Havard Square along Brattle street, so even if you don\'t snag one of the two outdoor table they provide, you can perch on  the wall and steps outside. They also have a second floor of seating indoors, but why sit indoors when the sun is shining?\n\nI had a regular cheeseburger, Pete got a double cheeseburger and we shared an old-school Coke with some chili cheese fries. Ordering was easy, but waiting was hard, watching all that tasty goodness prepared and cooked only to be given to people who were not me.\n\nNow does it hold up to the hype? Yes and no. The real stand-out were the chili cheese fries, in which the fries were nothing but a salty crispy conveyance of gloppy cheese and savory chili to my mouth. Maybe by themselves the fries aren\'t all that, but the chili cheese fries is definitely worth more than the sum of its parts.\n\nThe burger was good, with a thin but juicy patty, but I couldn\'t stand the soft pillowy sweet bun. Maybe if the bun was toasted it could hold up better, so perhaps I will ask for that next time. It was tasty, but I wouldn\'t call it mind-blowing - yet.']
['Enter four hungry people very fond of burgers as of late.\nEnter two more.  Then two more.\n\nFinally a slew of orders are made at the order counter.  "Next!" orders the cashier who only understands certain words like "cheese/burger, loaded, soda, extra, fries" and so on.  Requests for a cup for water are a cause for confusion and require managerial assistance.\n\nBurgers get sizzling on the flat grill; they are thin and juicy, you can hear them in the background.  Fries are piled high on oval plates and lined up for pick-up.  The wait is short, but the smell makes hungry people hungrier.\n\nHow many bites does it take? 3-5.\nHow much cash?  3-5.\n\nAll in all, it\'s a cheeseburger with a mayo-based sauce.  The patties are flat and thin, but juicy and fresh.  Condiments are free and include all the greats: relish, ketchup, mustard, raw onion, pickles, and jalapenos.  Extras = extra cash and aren\'t necessary given the condi-buffet selection.  It\'s ultra cheap and the burger is sized plenty small so you\'ll have room for fries and o-rings.  Sad no beer.\n\nIn a burger world, Flat Patties hits par.  I\'m still all about the burgers at Miracle.']
['Kudos indeed, Flat Patties (which I just accidentally typed as "Plat Fatties".  Mmmm!)\n\nYou have successfully graduated from an oily-smelling, dank cave in the part of the Garage I never stepped foot in into a chic and classy 90\'s-style New York loft, complete with exposed brick and track lighting, and have thereby gained my patronage.  The staff is smiley and charming, the burgers come out fast and furious, the toppings (bleu cheese!  Sauteed onions!) are interesting and highish quality, the glasses of fountain drinks are Coke products, you can get a honking, homemade pickle on the side, and it\'s all oh so cheap.\n\nI personally prefer a burger the size of your head, some heartier fries, and...well, enough seating, but I think we can all agree that a cheap flat patty upon a toasted bun enjoyed in fancy new digs just never goes out of style.']
['Flat patties is fantastic. The burgers and pulled pork sandwich are to die for, and the local craft beer is cheap! Great for lunch or dinner, or just beer.']
["I don't get it. People rave about this place but their burgers are tasteless and super-greasy. I find myself gulping mine down so I can try to finish it before it dissolves into a greasy mess on my plate. The fries are OK but small portions. Tasty Burger and Be.Good offer much better burger options, IMO, as did Charlie's when they were on top of their game (haven't been back there in awhile)."]
['My burger was undercooked, I took it back an they threw it right back on the grill, still it was red on the inside. Plus, they threw the wrong cheese on. Poor service.']
['Great food for good value. Harvard Square as anyone will tell you gets really expensive food wise. Flat Patties is one of those rare places that doesn\'t gouge a hole in your wallet for a good burger. \n\nI do enjoy a good burger every now and then but the thing I love to get the most is their grilled chicken sandwich with cheese. It\'s seasoned and juicy, so delicious and it\'s only $4.00. The staff is great to add or subtract anything you don\'t want. I for one am not a sauce person. The burgers are just as good and usually cooked perfectly when I order them. The fries are also tasty as they\'re hand cut and sprinkled with a little sea salt. A great compliment to any of the burgers or sandwiches there. \n\nI was sad when they moved out of The Garage. The Brattle location is a lot more "cozy" so you\'ll probably want to get your burger to go, especially if it\'s during the rush hour lunch time. But you don\'t have to wait long hours for good food. Less expensive than Bartley\'s and just as good if not better.']
['Small potatoes.  Seriously? $2 for 12 french fries?  The food was good, but for half the price of hamburger only 12 french fries?  Less than happy staff to tell me its 6 oz of potatoes.  What I had seemed less than one average potato.  For 2 dollars.  Geez.']
['Had a burger to go on my way from work. The meat was not cooked and the fries not great. Also when they wrapped it the bread was soggy.']
["Maybe I'm nuts, but I swear this tasted a bit differently when it used to be in the Garage... anyone else agree?? \n\nRegardless, this is definitely the best fast-food, cheap burger in Harvard Square.  Very tasty, juicy and lots of great toppings.  I recommend getting a double because you just get to experience the whole flavor a lot more.  Oh and the fries and onion rings are BOMB.  \n\nThe new space is pretty cool too - great people watching and the service is usually pretty quick.  It's easily a few steps up from a fast food joint, but they're not pretentious about their burgers and it's not too pricy either.  Good stuff."]
['I still think it was yumz.  Just not going back... because all weekend I felt kind of sick / heavy-stomached... Maybe it *is* too greasy..']
["I just read a review that said this place was like the east coast in-and-out, exactly right, would totally agree. \ni recommend the cheese burger and going with someone that will order either fries or onion rings, so that you can order the other and then share. \nthe burgers are definitely messy, so don't wear anything white, tan or light pink when dining here. \ni saw some people taking the burgers to-go but wanted to follow them and see them eat it because i bet the buns were super soggy. so if it were me, i wouldn't take it to-go. but then again, i'm typically starving when i go eat, so i can't wait that long. \none thing i didn't realize was the burger came with house sauce, and i added mustard. which wasn't all bad. and they also have some sort of onion situation in the condiment area, get those for your burger. \ni'd love to go back but calorie wise, it's a once a month thing only. \nyum."]
["A night at the theatre, in my mind, means a bite to eat. We had tickets fro the ART, just down the street. I've passed Flat Patties many times and decided it was time for a taste. We both had burgers....me with onion rings, the husband with cole slaw. The burgers were decent. The buns may have been brioche...they were good but soft. Glad we stopped in for a bite. Still, if I want a decent meal fast, I think there are other places around the Square with slightly better food."]
["I had friends in town and we hit up Harvard Square on a Sunday... the one day Mr Bartley's is closed.  (I've worked there for almost four years and have yet to try it out, WTF.)\n\nAny-whoo, not wanting the Brits to leave the US without an out-of-this-world burger experience, I took them to Flat Pattie's.\n\nI got the portabello sandwich with fries (and of course a diet coke.)  After being so hungry I wanted to gnaw my arm off, this was divine,\n\nFriends split two meat and cheese burgers and gave them rave reviews.  Fries were finished in a matter of minutes - thin shoestring types, perfect for dipping in ketchup.\n\nI love the upstairs seating area, and am glad they use the space wisely.\n\nIf there is a line out the door at Mr; Bartley's, head over to Flat Pattie's.  After all, if cooked well, a burger is just a burger."]
["I dont like to have to unhinge my jaw like some predatory python when trying to enjoy a burger, and i certainly dont like being left with a disintegrating bun and imploding burger on my hands. At Flat Patties i dont have that problem. \n\nThe burgers here are just as described, flat. However, they are still juicy, a little greasy and not over done at all. The secret sauce, whatever it is, is delicious but doesn't compete for attention and the bun to meat to cheese ratio is ideal. \n\nI first got hooked on the pulled pork sandwich. My last visit i deviated from my usual and got the cheeseburger. I ate the whole thing, was full, but none of that typical fast food eaters-remorse. I also had the fries, which i knew going in, had less than stellar reviews on yelp. I could see how people may not like them as they were thin and pretty squishy, but they werent frozen like most places, and were nuclear hot when i got them. I'm a fan. \n\ncome to think of it, it may be a flat patties kinda night for dinner... \n\np.s. i paid under 9 bucks for a burger, fries and a snapple (which itself was almost 3 bucks) please dont change flat patties! your food and prices are great!"]
['Second go at Flat Patties was an utter and severe let down. And made me look like a jackass cuz I was talking it up on the walk over there.\n\nFirst of all, this place is tiny. If there are more than like 5 groups of people here, there is nowhere to sit. We were lucky to get a seat. The walking up and down of the stairs is a tad annoying (maybe it is supposed to make you feel better about eating a fatty burger?) More likely, it was a tiny space they tried to make work but doesn\'t change the fact that it is small. Really small.\n\nI order, walk upstairs to the tiny table I managed to get out of sheer luck and ferocity, have to ask some of my party to wait up here while I go get the food/order. \n\nI can hear them yell my name and I go down to pick up my food. To my disgust it is a veggie burger. How do you confuse bacon cheese burger with plain veggie burger? I mean could these things be anymore polar opposites? they don\'t even sound alike. Now, while my party is eating I have to sit there and watch them eat while I sit there starving.\n\nTo their credit, my food comes out rather quickly. The cashier tries to flag me down to "fix" the situation but I said nah, I\'ll deal with it after I eat. \n\nAs soon as my burger is properly set up and ready to devour, I hear them call my name again. I think to myself, ok, maybe there is another Laura ordering. Wrong.\n\nI go downstairs and ask what the deal is, and they said that when they "fixed" my order in the computer it automatically sends it back to the cook and to disregard it. Really? Then why are you screaming my name over and over? Why don\'t you disregard it?\n\nI finally decide to address the credit card issue, they tell me (in extremely broken English) that they charged me the correct amount as a bacon cheeseburger is more than a veggie burger. I explain, never did I give you authorization to charge my card for this (albeit, minute amount) and I really don\'t feel I should owe you the difference when you screwed up the order to begin with and now I\'m down here talking to you instead of enjoying my food with my friends. This message was completely lost on the woman who kept insisting that she wasn\'t charging me for the third burger they made for me (I realize this... get it together, lady) and after many failed attempts at getting her to understand what I was saying, I gave up.\n\nThe burger while still pretty good (yet messier than I remember) was not worth the hassle of the stairs, lack of seating, and unprofessional staff. Sorry, Flat Patties, you lose what would have been a loyal customer.\n\nOh and the second time I went I can agree that the fries do suck and are overpriced, and the pickles are the strangest pickles ever. Bleh.']
["THIS is what fast food wishes it could be.\n\nNo, this is not the place to get some overpriced fancy steak burger. No, this is not a place to take your in-laws to impress them. This is a down-home, homecooked, greasy awesome burger joint that makes delicious burgers topped with a wide variety of toppings and serves them with a generous helping of tasty fries. The staff were super friendly to me the evening I stopped in, the service was quick, the facilities were clean, and above all, the food was delicious.\n\nIf you can ask for more than that from a fast food burger joint then please fill me in because I can't think of a single thing you could do to improve upon this sweet little find."]
["My boyfriend and I took advantage of the gorgeous day by exploring Harvard Square, an area neither of us are too familiar with. We just happened to walk past Flat Patties at lunch time, noticed all the diners eating outside, and decided to check out the menu.\n\nUpon seeing they had a veggie burger option, my boyfriend and I decided to give it a try. He got a pulled pork sandwich and I got a veggie burger with cilantro aioli, jack cheese, and jalapeno relish. I also got Coke in a glass bottle, which is always a plus.\n\nWhen I took my first bite I was not only pleasantly surprised, I was impressed. The veggie burger was obviously hand made and was one of the better veggie burgers I've tasted. The combination of aioli and jalapeno was a perfect flavor balance. The burger wasn't exceptionally large in size, but I was still full by the end of it.\n\nMy boyfriend said something very similar about his pulled pork regarding the expert blending of flavors. He said the cole slaw (which they put on the sandwich) was a nice pairing for the tangy sauce.\n\nThe price was also a nice surprise-- $13.50 for two sandwiches and two drinks. \n\nI'm very glad to have stumbled upon this restaurant and hope I get to enjoy some of their other sandwich options soon."]
['Great first time experience! The Manager Eric was more than welcoming and informative. I left the house with the intention in trying new things and my start to finish experience here was phenomenal. The freshly tossed caesar salad to the juicy southwest chicken samdwich and double cheese burger my friend and I had was flawless. Exceptional customer service and homemade recipes. We will definitely be back with more friends.']
["Decided to come here with a friend for dinner while we were walking around Harvard Square. The atmosphere is very casual, your order first and then self-seat. I had the roast beef sandwich, which didn't come with anything except roast beef and some onions. No veggies, which I wish the cashier or something told me about so I could at least order additional ones. On the plus side, there was a LOT of meat in the burger, probably 1-2 inches of medium-rare, thin cut roast beef. The bun was also warm and grilled, which was tasty and of course onions are always  good addition.\n\nOverall, this place is okay. And these burgers are CHEAP. Mine was only $5.50, which is a pretty good price for a burger."]
['Had a cheese burger and fries. It was good. Nothing flat about them, the buns were toasted just right I thought. Not bad, just your standard burger I would say.\n\nNice casual dining.']
["Oh jeez,  I love Flat Patties! \n\nI've had the regular cheeseburger, the swiss gruyere, and the bbq blue. I've also had hot dogs from here and grilled cheese. The hot dogs taste better than any I've ever eaten. They grill the buns in butter. Oh lord. \n\nI go here all the time. The cashier is sometimes rude, and the place is a kind of gross combination of greasy/antiseptic smelling, but I don't care. This places makes a great burger and its pretty cheap."]
["Amazing!!! Everything's fresh and delicious. Wide variety of options for different lifestyles. Would def come here again"]
['Teeny tiny place, but delicious burgers in a unique atmosphere. Dirt cheap, too!']
["Last experience was a 3, I hope it won't become the norm.  It was a real greasebomb last time and while overall I love their burgers and some greasy goodness, there's only so much grease a girl can take.  Maybe the green chile style I got somehow contributed to the excess, will give it another shot.  Fries are fine but super tiny.  In the meantime, I'll make the summertime trip to Sullivan's for one of their wonderful and crazy cheap griddled patties."]
["Honestly, I'm somewhat surprised this place is still open.  Each time I've gone into order from here, NO ONE else is in the place.  Flat Patties does burgers and tries to go a little upscale for fast food. You can add all sorts of toppings, my favorite is blue cheese and grilled onions. The burgers are on the smaller side, but overall decent value for the money."]
["Not the best and not the worst burgers in the area.\n\nThe burgers: greasy in a good way (for all the seattle-area people that may be looking at this, think Dick's). Tasty and unique toppings (tomato jam is pretty good, the fact that they have horseradish is something I have yet to see elsewhere). Prices on these are pretty good too.\n\nThe fries: Dreadful. Like really awful. Disappointing as the burgers are just tops.\n\nThe rest: Don't really bother. Nothing fantastic but nothing too unpleasant. Stick with the burgers and go elsewhere if you're in the mood for anything else."]
["Excellent cheap burgers.  Good sauce.  Yummy fries and onion rings.\nIt's rather annoying to have the humble burger put on an alter, when in reality, it really is just a superbly delicious sandwich.  Flat patties (I'm assuming they are thus named because they essentially look like frisbees) is honest and tasty, and the service is always friendly."]
["Fast &amp; yummy. I enjoyed my plain cheeseburger, but the house sauce just ain't flavorful enough. So I piled on the special onions to ramp my burger from 'pretty decent' to 'mouthful of awesome.' These onions -- pickled? spiced? whatever, they're awesome, snag some on the condiments table. I like all the topping combinations they offer, like the BBQ Blue (bacon, blue cheese, barbecue sauce) and Sunday Morning, with an egg, ham, and a fascinating tomato jam. \n\nI think the fries are pretty all right, but I like my fries thin anyway. It'd be cool if fries or onion rings came with the burger, but whatevz, it's fast food. And even so, I've always found the service friendly and non-surly, unlike your local McD's. \n\nLastly, Flat Patties is the first place I've been in 'round these parts that has Mexican Coca-Cola. Rumored to be made with real cane sugar, I'd never tried it, being so far north of the border. But I found it at Flat Patties, out in plain sight, on the menu, no big secret. The mystery was shattered, but it certainly was tasty."]
["Me versus Entropy (the Rapidly Disintegrating Bun)\n\n0:00 - 2:00 minutes: Bun winning by failing fast, getting soaked from outside inward, overloaded with juice from the griddled patties (and a bit too generous helping of house sauce).  Eating quickly, too quickly.\n\n2:00 - 4:00 minutes: Stabilization with movement towards center, and the density of the burgers ( with an assist from generous amounts of cheese) starts to reabsorb juice back in on itself. Eating less quickly, allowed to enjoy and savor every other bite.\n\n4:00 - 6:00 minutes: Progressively smaller bites, adopting Zeno's paradox/axiom of eating (infinitely smaller bites will lead to infinite burger). Experiment fails, as always. Burger fully eaten, as always. Bun does not ruin the party, despite initial impression that it would turn into gruel/meal right out of the gate.\n\nMe: 1\nEntropy: zero.\n\n(Shoestring fries, which aren't generously portioned but also aren't all that much extra, were negligible and probably just a formality. I wouldn't even bother)"]
["Flat Patties is a good spot for lunch or a casual dinner if you happen to be in Harvard Square. They've got a variety of sandwiches, burgers, and salads as well as a good variety of drinks. The tables outside are good for eating and people watching during the warmer months, and the counter inside is good for the same on colder days. The prices are good for the Cambridge/Boston area, where not many meals are cheap. My favorite part? They have pickle chips out with the ketchup, mustard, and other condiments. As someone who loves pickles and could eat them on the side of every meal, it's great to be able to plop a few on my plate without requesting them specially. I'd never come to Harvard Square specifically to eat here, but when I'm in Harvard Square and need to eat, I stop by."]
["American fast food located in a food court in Harvard Square. I stopped here because I noticed they had bread pudding for around $3.  Plus, I noticed the place had a large crowd which is usually a good indicator the food is good. Mostly college age kids...\n\nThe bread pudding I ordered was just OK.  I didn't find the dessert to be anything special.  The pudding had a banana flavor which I didn't like so much. My dad ordered the shredded pork sandwich.  He thought the sandwich was just OK.  Overall, the staff was friendly and prices were cheap (which explains the large crowd).  If you just want to grab a quick cheap lunch this is your place."]
['Great. All I can say is this place is delicious. Everything here was amazing. Quick speedy service and very clean here. I and others enjoyed the burgers and milkshakes here. I would highly recommend this place to many others.']
["Beefy, Cheesy BURGERS!!! Ahh, how this Wyoming girl has missed you! This is the place. Great beef! Great fries! Great service! This place is a wonderful option for BURGERS!! It is all the splendor that a good burger should be. That's it and that's all :)"]
["Ok. Good not great. On the plus side, the buns had been toasted just right. On the down side, there was a greasy oil slick that spread ominously. And the fries were forgettable.\n\nI'm planning on heading back at some point to try one of their specialty burgers, but I agree with Che's review that you shouldn't just get a burger.\n\nThat said, it's passable and has a super convenient location (right off the T toward Brattle)."]
["Quite possibly the perfect burger. I like mine with some avocado, provolone, and horseradish, along with the standard vegetables and house sauce. I can't imagine being disappointed by the burgers here, and the pulled pork! Oh man, really good pulled pork! Seriously. Not as much as you'll get at BBQ joint, but significantly better than most BBQ joints, and far cheaper. Cheaper than a cheeseburger in fact.\n\nMy one qualm is the newfound lack of delicious bread pudding. The man in charge tells me he'll cook me up a whole batch if I'll pay for it, though, and I just may take him up on it sometime.\n\nOh yeah, they make their own ice cream (frozen custard) too! Oh and they now bake their own buns, which are even better than the Piantedosi ones that they used at the old location. The buns are buttered and then grilled for a perfect crunch.\n\nIf you're the thrifty sort like myself, you'd probably do well do pass on the side dishes, which are a bit undersized. That said, they have some nice chili cheese fries."]
["Ross and I were stumbling around Cambridge this weekend after attending the Head of the Charles incorrectly. Everywhere was packed, so we ducked into this small place because there seemed to be room. There is some bar-like seating on the bottom floor and six or so tables in a loft upstairs. \n\nWe ordered a single cheeseburger and a pulled pork sandwich with the idea of splitting both. We got onion rings on the side. The food was ready pretty quickly. Very self-serve type of place. \n\nThe pulled pork (after college in NC, I'm spoiled on Carolina BBQ which is vinegar based and I haven't found anything like it outside of central NC) was sort of tasteless but on the sweeter side rather than the spicy side and the slaw which was on top of the pork (where it should be) was watery.\n\nThe single cheeseburger had a somewhat sugary tasting bun, similar to the pulled pork, but I noticed it more on the savory cheeseburger. The cheese wasn't present as an active taste just too diffuse. The burger was just eh, but greasy. Maybe I could've used ketchup? Didn't find the house sauce compelling. \n\nOnion rings were good to me, but Ross thought they were a little salty. \n\nI don't think I'll go back!"]
['-Get the South of the Boarder Burger (guac, pepperjack, jalepenos, buttered/toasted buns). Deliciousness.\n-Free refills!\n-Lightly fried fries.\n-Similar to Five Guys in quality, but more unique']
["Aside from their committing the worst summer sin (an overly air-conditioned dining room), I love everything about the new Flat Patties in Brattle Square!\n\nMy favorite change has to be the bun. It was great to begin with, but now it's a little chewier and has the perfect texture. The patties are still thin with a little bit of pink in the middle (how do they do it?) and the fries are still to die for!\n\nI'm in the thin-patty camp when it comes to burger-lovin', and I have to say that these are some of the best thin-patty burgers I've had. Definitely better than Five Guys which I grew up with in MD. It just has a cleaner feel and each of the ingredients has a more distinct flavor and texture, whereas the Five Guys burger kinda melds into one gloppy mess sometimes.\n\nA friend helped me discover something new at the fix-ins bar: the spiced onions! I don't know what they're really called, but they're onions and they've got spice. They've got this crazy sweet/salty/spicy flavor to them and I couldn't stop eating them plain! \n\nThere's plenty of seating upstairs, a couple tables outside and a counter on the main floor. \n\nI love these burgers!"]
['This place rocks!  \nWorking in Harvard Square, there\'s lots of options for lunch, however, a lot of the options, albeit, good, can be expensive.  \nI walked by Flat Patties several times over the past few weeks and never really paid much attention, then one day I saw people eating outside and the food looked great.\nIt\'s a small place with not that much seating inside, I think it caters more to the take-away crowd, like me.\n\nThe cashier was so sweet and helpful and when I ordered a veggie burger she explained their "special sauce" to me....and this special sauce is the same as my bloody special sauce....WTH!!!  Anyhow, I also ordered the cheese fries and a coke and it was under 7 bucks, very cool!!!\n\nThe burger was yummy with lettuce and tomato but the cheese fries....OMG, soooo good, they put cheese, scallion and lentils(I think) on top.  Also, the portions are pretty big.  They also make sandwiches and regular burgers.\nHeart attach food at it\'s finest here people!!!!\nI\'m not a big fast food eater at all, however, when I want it, I want it like this!! \nFor me, this place is great to have close by, and I will be back for more.']
["Had Flat Patties over the weekend. I couldn't have had a worse experience. I've had most of the big name burgers in Boston and this wasn't much better than McDonalds.\n\nCold, stale bun, medicore toppings, poor fries. I haven't disliked a burger like this in a long time."]
["Downright delicious!  I like this genre of burger and Flat Patties delivers.\n\nMr. Bartley's?  They claim to be the best burger in the country.  But, they aren't even the best burger within a 1 mile radius.  \n\nIn other words, Flat Patties is the BEST burger in the Boston area"]
["This place reminds me of an old school burger joint, and they serve old school meals.  Not sure what I mean? All you have to remember is this:  GREASE.  \n\nThe fries?  Ehh...I'd skip them next time.  Far too greasy and thin (think Steak and Shake if you're from the Midwest).  \n\nBut OMG...the veggie burger here is one of those deliciously greasy burgers!  Of course, I think it gave me an upset stomach later, but even that won't stop me from dining here again!"]
["I have been living near Harvard Sq. and Flat Patties was a weekly must since its opening. I've been there many many times, and I always order the grilled chicken sandwich. It is by far the best grilled chicken sandwich I have ever tasted. Chicken tastes like chicken, unlike some other places, the pink sauce on top of it is just delicious and I really appreciate that they roast the bun. \nAnd the other thing I appreciate about their burgers is that they do not make you feel sated  afterwards. They are light and tasteful. \n\nMy husband only eats the South of the Border, and he LOVES it..\n\nTheir fries are good, but a little bet over-fried, but I guess it is their way of cooking it because it is always like that. \n\nThe prices are great..\n\nNow that I ,unfortunately, moved to Boston, I still go to Flat Patties from time to time. It is my favorite when it comes to burgers.."]
['Girlfriend and I came here on our second visit to Harvard square. I had the "South of the Boarder Burger" and she had the "Pulled Pork Sandwhich". The burger was pretty good for the price. Just a little too salty for my taste. The pulled pork was great flavorful, juicy, and tender. I also got a side of cole slaw and a beer. Cole slaw was nice and refreshing and went well with the beer. Overall great food for the price!']
['The best burger place in Harvard Square by far. Quick, affordable, and delicious,  this is a great place to stop in to grab a bite. The only problem is the lack of seating (this is the only thing keeping the review from 5-stars). This place is a must for burgers and cheese fries.']
["As others have said, the menu is simple, pretty greasy, and everything I could hope for in a burger joint.  In my opinion there's nothing quite like a burger, fries, and a milk shake.  Flat Patties has those fundamentals down pat.\n\nHaving been to Flat Patties a handful of times now, I can say they're consistently satisfying.  The burgers are awesome but I want to point out that they're a no-nonsense business that manages to have personality without really forcing it.  Last time I was there, the manager was training a new cashier and was a real class act.  Even though he was so busy we shared some friendly banter and his attention didn't waver until he knew I was getting exactly what I wanted."]
["Went here for lunch during the work week and it wasn't too busy but busy enough so I didn't think it was a crappy place to eat. I ordered a hot dog and onion rings and my friend ordered the Grilled cheese. The food was good and hit the spot but over priced, as everything is in Harvard Sq. My friend's grilled cheese looked like a middle schooler made it but paid a little over $4. My meal with a sparkling water was a little over $7. No reason either of those should have been as much as they were. All in all, the food was good, service was quick and the venue was clean. I'd go there again for lunch."]
["I have eaten here twice and have gotten take out a few times also. The food is definitely worth the price! They have a good variety of menu options for a burger place, and the drinks and desserts are very unique! The staff is very nice and efficient, however their appreance would be greatly improved by some sort of a uniform. They are dressing like their hanging out around their house, which having worked in a resturaunt I understand your clothes get very dirty so why would they dress better, but the owner should atleast provide shirts so they don't look do sloppy. Also I observed many customers trying to get into the bathroom not knowing they had to be buzzed in waited and waited thinking it was just occupied. Perhaps a sign would help!"]
["I went here once and was unimpressed so I'm not sure why I bothered going back (call me an optimist) but the food here is very meh and unremarkable and lacking flavor. Hopefully this time I learned my lesson and will go somewhere else for lunch in the future."]
["My overall impression is not so good. \n\nFirst of all the flow of traffic once inside is awkward. If there are a lot of people ordering or around the register, it'll look busy. But maybe it's not. More important is to check out the seating both downstairs and upstairs. Because maybe you'll order your food and then find out there's no where to sit. A bummer on a cold or wet day. \n\nI ordered the BBQ, Bacon Bleu burger. Eh. It was nothing memorable and would be easy to miss the fact that it was one of their specialty burgers. The toppings were forgettable. \n\nThe fries - like everyone else says - not good. Thin style and they should be crispy and are definitely NOT. Yuck limp fries!\n\nFountain sodas and actual glasses, 50 cent refills. Of note, if you appreciate a restaurant that doesn't use paper cups."]
['I absolutely love the Sunday Morning burger. Everything was perfect with my meal. The burger, the fries, even the tea! I was either so hungry anything would have tasted 5 stars or these guys really know how to make a good burger and fry combo!']
["Went to Harvard Sq to go eat at Bartley's but sadly it was closed.   Walked around to find another place to lunch and came across Flat Patties.   Seemed to have a basic menu and prices were low so decided to give it a try.   \n\nI opted to get the grilled chicken sandwich that came with tomato, lettuce and 'house sauce'.   This 'house sauce' tasted like absolutely nothing.  The lettuce on the sandwich had more flavor.  The grilled chicken tasted like cardboard and after 2 bites I couldn't bare to eat the rest.   \n\nI basically have nothing good to say about this place except it's cheap prices.   I recommend holding out and heading to Bartley's."]
["This is a pretty good restaurant for tourists. \n\nFor every other Cantabrian burger afficionados, there is a Jim's Deli (Brighton, MA), O'Sullivans (Somerville, MA), and also 4 Burgers (Cambridge, MA). \n\nI had a Southwestern Style burger with chili-cheese fries. They both were good, but for $9.90, a little pricey. Only a tourist can afford this sustainably."]
["Burgers are delicious, greasy heaven. Plus the guys that work here are cool, known them since Felipe's opened years ago and they are always friendly. Yuengling on tap for 2 dollars and 3-3.50 for craft beers on tap. Awesome."]
['WTF?  The wife and I called in for an order last night and no answer...no biggie, sometimes they\'re too busy to take orders over the phone so we head down to pick up the BEST burger in Boston ONLY TO FIND IT BORDERED UP AND CLOSED.  I\'m double-parked outside waiting for her and I notice that it\'s no longer listed on the "places to eat" sign out front when she pops back out only 2 minutes later with the saddest face you can imagine.  "They\'re closed.." she said; "I\'ll never taste a flat patties burger again!".\n\nThat, my friends, SUCKS!\n\n\nUPDATE!!!\n\nA kind yelper gave me the heads up that FLAT PATTIES is, in fact, NOT closed but moved around the corner.\n\nHOORAY!!!\n\nLet\'s make that 5 stars now for the BEST burger, BEST rings and a rather delish pulled pork and RB sandwich.']
["Had their special burger tonight (11/1) gruyere cheese, carmelized onions and rosemary aioli for $5.50 - absolutely delicious! I've paid way more downtown for a burger, maybe larger, but way less tasty - it was by far one of the best burgers, ever. Puts 5 guys and 5 napkins (same sort of burger for $12-14) to shame. Owner was there, had a great conversation; this is a gem...very reasonable prices, delicious burger, didn't try the fries, but will next time. \nWorth trying if you like a great burger for a very reasonable price..why go to McD or B King where for just about the same dollar, you can get a much better burger. The cook was super friendly and accomodating, I like my burger very well done..even the cashier was friendly and welcoming. Would absolutely recommend."]
['Great location.  Good prices.  Okay burgers.  Horrible fries (much too over cooked and tastes like old oil).\n\nStaff seems very happy.  I liked the toasted buns.']
['Fun spot on Harvard Square. They share the spot with a burrito spot. A little confusing, but do able. The bread was super, and the meat yummy but needed more meat on the sandwich. A double would be the better bet. My kids lived the fries.']
["For the second stop in our quest for the best burger, we tried Flat Patties.  It isn't overly hyped, so I believe that helped its overall score.\n\nThe patties were indeed flat and I'm glad I got a double, or I would have ended up still hungry.  I wish the bun was thicker though; it didn't stand a chance against the grease from two patties.\n\nThe fries looked delicious, but were deceiving.  They were thin, but soggy instead of crisp, and were lacking in flavor.\n\nThe price couldn't be beat, two full meals for under $20."]
['Flat Patties is more like 4.5 stars.  I was ecstatic to discover a Boston fix for my In-N-Out cravings.  On a bright and clear Sunday evening, I ordered one hamburger to go.\n\nIt was delicious.  For $3.95, it was the perfect size, and the house sauce was amazing.  There were fresh condiments along the counter - including jalapenos, pickles, diced onions, relish, and onions with BBQ? sauce.\n\nFast food at its best.  Greasy and tasty.  Just like In-N-Out.  Maybe a little less fresh, but still so, so good.']
['Have been here twice with friends. Fish and Chips are ok. Too much oil for Onion Rings. Burgers are too salty.']
["Any of you missing Shake Shack? Or are you craving a California-style burger, in which the patty isn't a 1/2 pound hunk of beef? If the answer is yes to either question, you need to get to Flat Patties immediately. \n\nFlat Patties has sated my craving for Shake Shack for the time being. The beef here is well cooked and seasoned. The beef is juicy and flavorful and probably about 1/4 pound in size. It's also evenly cooked too. Few things are worse in burgers when half the patty is cooked well-done and the other half is cooked medium rare. \n\nThe fries were not very impressive, but the onion rings were good. However, you come here to get a burger, not the fries."]
["We wanted to eat at Bartley's the famous burger place in Cambridge, MA but the owner went on vacation Fri 5/23-Memorial Day.  Bummer.  Since we were hungry and didn't know where else to go we somehow ended up eating at this food court where Flat Patties was.\n\nI got a shredded pulled pork sandwich.  It was fine, but nothing special.\n\nGot a cup for tap water.\n\nShred Pork $3.25 + .16 tax = $3.41 total.\n\nBathrooms: Down the stairs before Ben &amp; Jerry's."]
["I was very happy with my south of the border burger. They're not huge, but they are cheap and tasty, and I like my options! Everything's self serve, and the place is really small, but it was warm so I ate outside."]
["Inexpensive but the patties are very juicy.  It's a nice place to have a quick dinner.  I'm not giving 5 stars, because the food wasn't outstanding.. It was an average decent burger place."]
['It is really too bad that the quality has dropped so much and so soon, \n\nI truely dislike my mouth tasting of rancid grease.  get a fry cook that can fry, everything was off  and there is no excuse for food being fried at the wrong temperature (too low) and being soaked with old rancid oil, close your doors before you kill someone.  YUCK!  Hopefully this was just a bad day, but it will be while before i try ti agian.A longggg while.  nothing like wanting comfort food, and recieving a kick in the gut,  I think i need a barf bag.']
["I just ignored this place when it was in the garage, probably because I was on my way to Pho Le's . So when I saw it at it's new location, I thought why not... I'm very glad I listened to myself. \nI had their classic burger with onion rings.. soo yummy! Somehow they get their patty flat and crispy and then they put this treat on a buttered bun = heaven. My boo got a roast beef sammich with horseradish sauce and he loved it. Usually we give each other a bite of each others food but we just kept eating .. no offering up this day :)\nReal good greasy hamburger.. I will return again!"]
["Easy place to grab a tasty burger at an affordable price. We actually like it better than Bartley's. The only downside is that sometimes it can be hard to find a seat."]
['Great double cheeseburger! And beer for just over $2. You can also have burritos, tacos, etc in the same place']
["The burgers are amazing.  This is the only affordable place in the square for sure.  The burgers are way juicier than Bartley's and the fries are better--no contest.  The frozen custard is also delicious (and I'm a Midwesterner, so I know my custard...).  Grilled chicken and veggie burgers are also a win.  PLUS TWO DOLLAR BEERS."]
["I will give this place credit:  the burgers are decent.  However, it's not really all that memorable.  It's in the Garage, so I wasn't expecting it to be, but it's not like it's the greatest food in the world.  It is also really greasy, as others have noted.\n\nI should point out that there's a b. good nearby this place, so if you're looking for a more healthy burger option, there is that available."]
['I love their "South of the Border" burger which has Jalapeno relish , Avocado &amp; Cilantro Aioli. It was very tasty and spicy hot . The burger patty is not very big or not very small. I like to have the burger wit $2-3 draft beers which is damn good.  \n\nNice burger and beer for less than $10 bucks - Pretty sweet deal !!!']
["I used to really like this place. Perhaps I'm changing with age. But, I found the burger OK but not great.  The soft bun completely collapsed and felt squishy. I much prefer Shake Shack."]
['Best burger I\'ve had in as long as I can remember... for only $5.50! Granted it wasn\'t big, but it was only $5.50 and it tasted amazing. I got the "South of the Border."']
["Really wasn't worth it. The chili cheese fries were okay, but the burger left something to be desired. Limpy lettuce and sad tomatoes...\n\nI like UBurger better"]
["I went there to get my husband a burger and cheese fries. Very small burger. Tiny portion of fries with barely any cheese on it. But my biggest gripe is that since my husband had gone to the website to figure out what he wanted he knew that they used peanut oil to fry with. It is stated on the website. BUT NOT IN THE RESTAURANT! So I asked and it was confirmed that they do. I have a peanut allergy and I know that not everyone does but really, could they put up a sign? Someone is going to have an allergic reaction by having some french fries and not realizing they are fried in peanut oil. When I suggested it I was told they know and want to put one up but the owner wont allow it. Sounds like an ass and we won't be back."]
["Went there last night and loved it! I got the veggie burger and you can see the veggies in it! Some places make veggie burgers that are clearly from the frozen food section at BJs and others make the kind that fall apart as soon as you bite into it (cough, cough, Met Burger Bar), but Flat Patties gets it just right. They got an extra star for being under 5 bucks and having jalapenos and sauteed onion in their condiment tray. \n\nMy boyfriend got the double bacon cheeseburger and even though I wouldn't touch a cheeseburger with a ten foot pole, even I had to admit it looked good. He gave it a big thumbs up as well. Cheap and quick date. I wish there was a little more room to sit down, but otherwise, we really enjoyed it. We're planning on going back and trying the milkshakes made with custard when its warm enough to actually warrant a cold dessert."]
['How could I not have reviewed Flat Patties?!\n\nTake a Big Mac™ and then imagine it made at home. That\'s what you\'ll be getting at Flat Patties.\n\nIt\'s magnificent, truly one of the best burgers I have ever had. It\'s cooked perfectly, the only negative aspect about the burger is that it\'s very very VERY greasy. So greasy, in fact, that the bun gets easily soaked in grease - which is a little gross. Nevertheless, this is America! Land of the free, home of the brave! We can have anything we want in America!\n\nThe french fries are thinly cut shoestring, meh. They actually aren\'t the best. They weren\'t seasoned, and I had to use plenty of ketchup just for some flavor. \n\nThe location, while good is BAD. The physical location in Harvard Square is good, but there\'s too much traffic, not enough parking spaces and it\'s a hellish location to get into. \n\nThey are in the process of moving, very close by - I\'m not sure specifically where.\n\nThe seating it just bad, when the place is busy, you have to go out into the "mall area" to get some seating - especially for groups. Again, they\'re moving, so this might not be a problem in the new location.\n\nPrices are ok, around $7 for a double cheeseburger and the services was efficient and nice. The soda is slightly expensive however, but it\'s Harvard Square and the prices are warranted. \n\nI strongly recommend that you ditch the $1 Big Mac™ deal at the Whitman\'s McDonalds to go get yourself one of these (when they reopen). \n\nCactus Approved.']
["I'm pretty picky when it comes to burgers, and Flat Patties left me at least satisfied.  \n\nA bit pricey, but still tasty.  The quality of the ingredients was definitely above average, and they have a nice little condiment bar filled with what I would consider gourmet toppings.  \n\n I currently live in Back Bay, and wouldn't make another special trip out here just to visit, but if I were in the vicinity and wanted a burger, I'd definitely stop in again."]
["Stopped for a quick bite with mixed reviews.\n\nBurgers were great, though mine was smeared with way too much mayo.  The fries were some of the best I've had lately, though a very small serving for the add-on price.  Milkshake was also really good.\n\nThe big drawback for us was that they have un-insulated ducting above where you wait in line, and above the stairs leading to the second floor tables.  Constant drip of moisture on your back/neck as you're waiting and into your food as you carry it upstairs.  Wrap your ducts!"]
['Great Mexican food at very cheap prizes. To me it definitely beats the chains around + the service is cool and the music is latin. Love this place and came back the day after my first visit for more. Good for lunch or a quick and simply dinner.']
['Flat Patties is up there with UBurger for my favorite fast food burger. The house-ground patties are thin, juicy, and well griddled, held up perfectly by a toasted bun. FP has a great selection of toppings, including green chile, fried egg, blue cheese, mushroom, etc., but I usually fall back on the classic cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato, and special sauce. The fries and rings are both so good I can never decide, and the toppings bar provides sharp onions, jalapenos, relish and pickles to cut through that rich beefy goodness.']
["I ate here after seeing it featured on the Phantom Gourmet's burger show. The burger is really good, served with a toasted, buttered bun and fresh lettuce and tomatoes. True, the burger is almost hard to eat because it's so tender, but it's worth the slight mess. I just cut mine into halves before I eat them to minimize the mess.\n\nTheir special sauce is somewhat like thousand island dressing (but not really) and somehow really tasty with the burger and toasted bun."]
["Addictive. One burger and I'm hooked. I even went back 2 days in a row (in my defense it was a weekend, I do have a life that does not revolve around finding burgers to eat in Harvard Square).\n\n\nMaybe it's the special sauce, maybe it's the tasty cheese melted to perfection. Who knows?"]
['Flat Patties is definitely up there for what it is. At the end of the day, it really is a fast food restaurant. \n\nThat being said, it\'s great when you\'re in the mood for some quick, good, (greasy), affordable burgers. As the name suggests, they are of the flat variety (which, I\'ve been told is the "California" style as opposed to the larger "East Coast" style), but, damn, are they good!']
["I think a 3.5 would be more accurate for the burger, but the fries were too soggy from all the oil and grease and the burger was extremely messy. Although tasty and satisfying at a fair price, I couldn't get over how gross it made me feel when all my napkins became transparent after the meal."]
['One of the best veggie burgers in Boston/Cambridge area. Fries are a bit too greasy for my liking, but the burger more then made up for it. You can get like 3x stack of patties, but who physically could!? they are already crazy big with just the regular stuff. Be warned their  in house root beer had a tendency to be flat, and seating can get a tad awkward.\nTheir mushrooms are really good too!']
['Flat patties has pretty great burgers, but not much more. The salads leave much to ask for with not much besides lettuce. The sandwiches are decent, but nothing to write home about. They make up for this with their tasty burgers with great toppings. Nothing fancy, nothing expensive, just a good serving of greasy comfort food.']
["My prior review was for their previous location, and I think they have cleaned up their act in their new location.\n\nExtremely juicy burgers... you need to eat them over the plate. Good beef flavor. Love the bun, griddled with some butter. Like the larger size; good value. I rank these on par with Shake Shack (and both are better than Tasty Burger, by a long shot, IMHO). \n\nEDIT: \n\nThe first time I went here... things were looking good. I was enchanted by the pseudo-fast food style burger. But then.... I bit into a piece of string! Not thread, but big, thick, white string, tied in a little loop and everything. It was cooked right into the pattie. Nasty, nasty. But I gave it a second chance. This time, the bottom bun had two bright red splotches on it. NOT the same color as the juices dripping out of the burger... dark red, like it had been dipped in raw meat juice. Still, I tore the spots off and persisted (what can I say? I was hungry!), only to bite into a nice long, black hair. Goddamn. Three strikes, you're out. \n\nGiven the smattering of other health and sanitation related reviews, I'd steer away from this place."]
['I went to Flat Patties and was not sure what to think given it was counter service.  I was pleasantly surprised.  The double cheese burger and fries was great service on nice plates.  The space was clean and modern.  The price was pretty cheap so overall it was great!! Another great place in Harvard Square!!']
["Flat Patties remains the best burger at Harvard square. The meat has all the flavor and juiciness you need, the bun soaks up all that juiciness but still remains crispy and substantial and you can find your favorite toppings combo. They have great fries and amazing milkshakes to boot. Skip the tourist trap burger joints and come straight here. You won't be disappointed."]
['I\'m almost sad to write this review, since I\'ve been to FP two times before and always liked their food. However, I went in today and ordered a hamburger, and asked to substitute the buns for a side -- my friend recommended FP to me specifically because of their flexibility, and the first time we came we got hamburgers with fries instead of buns, no problem. \n\nThis time, however, the cashier immediately said no. Not "Sorry, our policies have changed," not "Maybe we\'ve done this in the past, but we need to stick to our rules now," not even "We can do that, but you\'ll have to pay the difference." Just no. When I explained that I\'ve requested a substitution before, she waffled around looking for the manager, and came back a few minutes later with a surly looking guy who told me, "Look, maybe they do this in Rome, but here we can\'t do that. The buns are 50 cents, and the fries are 2 dollars." He then turned away abruptly and, in essence, kicked me out of the restaurant.\n\nI have NEVER been treated like this before in any restaurant in Cambridge. FP, if you insist on hiring Central/South American staff who can barely speak intelligible English, the least you could do is be friendly to those you are supposed to serve. I will never come back here -- there are plenty of better options in the Square, like Bartley\'s and b.good, and I think my stomach won\'t miss your greasy food either.']
['The only thing positive I can say about this place was I wasn\'t hungry anymore after finishing my chicken sandwich. The down side is that there was NO taste to if at all. The bread and "Special Sauce" (ketchup and mayo) were the only things that really had any flavor. The fries were greasy and unappealable. I knew we in trouble when the pulled pork sandwich was made by microwaving a small container that looked nothing like pork. Whatever sauce was used was a poor excuse for BBQ.']
["I think this might be a conspiracy by the fast-food chains to win back the shop-local converts. I have not had a worse burger. Soggy bun, flavorless tomato (and it's summer! - at least, it was when I started this review, but somehow didn't post it.), freezer-burned lettuce, runny sauce contributing to the soggy bun, just a mess. The store layout is also cramped, with no real room to stand in line or wait for an order. 1 star for crispy, properly-salted onion rings, and 1 star for stocking legit sugar-sweetened coke in glass bottles."]
["This is the first review I've ever written, so you know Flat Pattie's is as good as it gets. The smell of these delicious patties literally hooked my friend and I by the nostrils and dragged us inside. We both got the special for the day: Swiss Gruyure, Carmalized Onions, and Rosemary Aioli. Upon first bite, we both nearly dissolved into tears at the realization that this was a special and therefore might not appear again. The buns were like fluffy meat pillows. The Swiss Gruyure made us feel like queens of our domain. The carmelized onions? well there's nothing more perfect than carmelized onions, is there? The rosemary aioli was subtle yet brilliant, like a rosemary fairy whispering into your ear after each bite, but instead of your ear, your tastebuds. I felt like a thief - the burger only cost 5.50...WHAT?\n\nEat here. And try the house made Sriacha. Seriously."]
["Once I learned there was a west coast style burger-joint hidden in Harvard square, I ran there as fast as I could. Literally ran there.\n\nIt was worth it. What you get here are affordably priced hamburgers that are juicy and beefy, with just enough of that grease to wipe away from your chops after you take a bite.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? Well, it's close. but the patties, while great, lack an intense beefy flavor. The topping selection is good but could use a bit more for some unique twists. Minor quibbles aside, Flat Patties is the perfect cure for your burger craving."]
["This place is cute on the outside, and there were lots of customers sitting outside, so we figured we try it...so disappointing! Perhaps we should have ordered burgers, but instead we ordered the portobello mushroom burger and the fish and chips plate. Both mediocre at best. The fish and chips came with lukewarm fries, coleslaw, and two very small pieces of fish (which left my friend still hungry). The portobello burger came with toppings, but no extra fun sides, such as a pickle, chips, coleslaw, or anything like that. It's cheap, but there are so many other options in Harvard Square that are equally well priced and that taste much much better."]
["Greasy goodness. My BF and I were looking for a good greasy hamburger place because we wanted some serious hamburger and french fries goodness. \nThe bad reviews on this place said that it was too greasy so we thought it would be a great place for us to lunch. And oh it was. There is not much seating though so beware. \nThe fries are pretty good but the french fries are better\nThe bottled sodas aren't cold so go with a fountain drink \nI got the regular burger and he got a double. The grease dribbled down my chin and soaked the bun. PERFECT"]
["I am so torn about the little grease situation happenin' here.  On the one hand, I had to use about 47 napkins (+/- 11 napkins) to blot the grease off my buns (gorgeous mental image, I know. You're welcome.) and patty, and I even held up the leaf of lettuce to watch the oil slide off (amusing as an activity, gross as a necessary food-prep measure).  My molten-hot slice of day-glo orange cheese, when cooled, came off in one shimmering sheet (that I obviously proceeded to stretch into shapes throughout the meal like Play-Doh or Gumby).  Yes, on the one hand, the amount of grease in one burger is enough to keep the fryalator cranking at McDonalds for a week.  However, on the other hand...\n\nOn the other hand, post-blotting, this burger is actually rather fantastic.  Begs the question: Is this burger that tasty because of the grease-bath or in spite of it?  Had they griddled my oh-so-perfect patty sans-liquid-cellulite, would it have tasted as good as it did post-blotting? I don't know.  What I do know, however, is that it is completely worth the tree's-worth of blotting napkins to never have to find out.\n\nMy man likes his burgers cheesy and multi-layered, and he also understands that a dude does not pick through his burger (except to pull out the tomatoes but we'll break him of that habit yet) to blot off the grease without getting a few curious (and judge-y) stares.  Therefore, my boyfriend's plate quickly became a gloppy, cheesy mess as the oil-soaked bun crumbled under the pressure of taming the griddled beast that lay within.  No matter - he happily ate it and will certainly return for more.  \n\nFries are crispy and delicious, and this place serves up classic Coke in bottles.  There are a few salad offerings that looked unremarkable but were reasonably priced...I assume they're more offered up so the people whose friends or S.O. dragged them to a greasy burger joint against their will wouldn't starve.  My solution for those people would be to peer-pressure them into eating these tasty burgers, though I suppose that wouldn't be good for business.  \n\nRecommendation? Well, I'm not a griddled-patty sorta lady (I like a burger so thick it could irritate my TMJ and so red that it's served up still mooing)...HOWEVER, despite my bias, I think these are very tasty.  Come on a nice day, sit outside, take a lot of napkins, perhaps consider skipping the congealed and subpar cheese (just this once...or maybe smuggle your own in in a baggy!), and enjoy the cheap and tasty meal.  Also, this burger tastes a heck of a lot better when you don't attempt to estimate the calorie or sodium content.  Trust me here."]
["Was looking for a quick-ish place to eat and came across this place. I ordered the South of the Border burger and it was great. Patty was pretty standard but the jalapeño relish and the cilantro aioli made the burger. Oh man, I wish I had the recipe for that jalapeño relish. Burger size was a little small as was the fries portion. Wasn't a huge fan of the fries. They were cut a little too thin and were a bit greasy. Overall a great fast food place. But more expensive than your Mickey D's or Burger King but seriously a hundred times better. Would have given it 4 stars if the burgers were a little bigger."]
["To me there are three important ingredients in making a good burger.  One is the meat.  It needs to be of good quality and not frozen.  Two is the bread and toppings.  They need to be fresh and of good selection and quality.  Third is the fries.  Anybody who uses frozen fries is out in my mind (That means you Bartley's)..\n\nAnyways, Flat Patties meets those needs on all counts.  The beef is fresh, they have a lot of different toppings, the bread is quite good, and the french fries are fresh cut and cooked.  A major surprise was the onion rings.  They use a tempura batter instead of the heaving breading most people use.  This makes them light a tasty.  They actually taste like a cooked onion instead of heavy breading.\n\nFlat Patties is as close to the mecca of flat top grilled burgers (in-n-out) that I can find on the east coast.\n\nPlus the pickles are dill instead of the sickly sweet ones most places supply."]
["My favorite burger spot! The meat patty is always moist, tender, juicy, and cooked to perfection. They also give a generous portion of different sides and condiments. Oohhh, the pulled pork sandwich is excellent in flavor, and it is supper juicy finger lickin good. If you're a student on a budget like me, this place is really super cheap and the quality of their burger is excellent."]
["Whoa! I didn't know this place was hidden away in the Garage, so I've been going to b.good. for my burger fix when I'm in Harvard Sq. Now I don't have to but up with baked fries!\n\nHand cut, tasty fries.  Friendly staff willing to make one last burger before they shut down. Easy to order, quick to arrive.\n\nBut the real question: how was the burger?  It did not disappoint.  In true West Coast style, they've got thin patties griddled to perfection to maintain all that delicious juice.  A good selection of condiments and toppings are added even before you have to start paying for the extra special stuff like bacon or avacado.  The buns have a light fry in butter, pressed beneath a big piece of metal so that the whole burger when all put together is perfectly sized to fit in your mouth. No snake-like jaw unhinging required to fit the massive beast in your mouth as at some places.\n\nThis is a solid burger.  And with a single patty cheeseburger costing just $4 and change after tax, it's a pretty great deal.  This is my new Harvard Sq. hotspot for fast food burgers."]
['5 stars for the chicken sandwhich with their sauce AND some bbq sauce.  Sometimes they forget to add the bbq sauce which is really annoying when 5 min ago I just asked for it, but Damn when they get it right they get it riight!! Yummy.']
['This is one of those times when Yelp would lie to you.  You\'d look this badboy up on your Yelp Iphone App and you\'d be like "yo lets go here, it\'s 4.5 stars it must be the illest"\n\nILLest is right, when it comes to stomach upset and sadness after eating there.  We ordered the cheezeburger with the works.  What we got was a sad piece of flavorless weak meat.  I know this place is not for "the tastiest burger ever" but this was barely edible.\n\nAfter eating here my friends and I all felt awful inside.  We had to cancel our Saturday night plans over how we felt.  My roommate was farting so hard he literally must have sharted and stained his underwear. The whole house smelled like failure and sadness.  I was bummed on this place.  My insides felt like an internment camp.\n\nWhat a depressing experience.  I won\'t forget you Flat Patties.  You are now on my list of "Places To Never Go Again"']
['in terms of actual quality and price, this may be the best burger in the square. Nice joint.  Wish I discovered the place sooner']
['We totally did not expect this place to be any good. It is a little hole in the wall, and while it isn\'t dirty, it seems a little dingy for my tastes. Just one bathroom, as since this is Boston you have to get buzzed in because heaven forbid you use a public restroom without the entire world knowing, but that is a whole other rant.\nI am limited as to what I can eat and have some heath problems meaning that I had to eat, or at least drink something right then, so the family and I headed here because we knew it would be quick. I was distracted and had a headache so I just picked something without cheese and that wasn\'t deep fried. Normally I like my burgers bloody, but now a days it really isn\'t a good idea in any restaurant, never mind a little place like this, so I was good with the medium well. Let me tell you, it was delicious. The only thing I added was pickles and it was perfect. My daughter got the hand cut fries and they were lovely. I tried them and it took all of my will power not to say "screw the stomachache later" because I haven\'t had such good fries since I was a young girl. If they had malt vinegar they would have been perfect. \nThe best part is that it is a great value. Very inexpensive, all three of us ate for under 25.00 which is better than we could do at Burger King and this was actually tasty. I am definitely going here next time I am in Harvard Square, which will be Sunday. I can\'t wait. :)\n\nOh, also, the staff were WONDERFUL.. friendly, kind and courteous.']
['The thing about eating at Flat Patties is that you really have to budget for it.  I don\'t mean "budget" in terms of money, because it\'s cheap eats - in the neighborhood of $7 for a burger, side, and drink.  I mean you need to budget in terms of how many other calories you plan to consume the day you go there, because if you eat normally on top of having a Flat Patties cheeseburger you\'ll practically be able to hear your ventricles slamming shut.  You have to eat strategically at this place if you don\'t want to unintentionally dock three years off of your life.  \n\nThat said, the burgers here are SO good - they practically melt in your mouth, and the buns are wonderfully fluffy and delicious too.  Additionally, they put this mayo-relish-ketchup-y concoction on the burgers that gives them a very distinctive, unique taste.  \n\nHowever, Flat Patties\' major drawback is the sides.  The fries are nothing to write home about (they tend to be thin and limp), and the onion rings are solid only if you order a large - no joke, if you order a small you can expect to get maybe six or seven rings on your plate.  Even still, this is my favorite fast-foody burger joint in Cambridge because the burgers are just THAT good - you have to try one if you go there.']
['I loved this place when they were in The Garage and I\'m so proud of them for moving into their new "big boy" digs on Brattle St.\n\nIt\'s greasy fast food, which has its time and place.  The burgers are the best, there\'s really no reason to move further down the menu.\n\nThe fries are no big deal, but the onion rings will have you plaaning your next visit before you\'re done chewing your first bite.\n\nThe decor is comfy and much more inviting than your usual fast food joint.  It\'s easy to linger over your burger and rings.']
['cute, cheap, non-healthy, tasty food. feels like a cute boston cafe with the red brick walls and the tiny upstairs. not too crowded, so I was able to enjoy my lunch and catch up uninterrupted with an old friend :)\n\nhad the asian salad. tasted good, but i think they put dry ramen noodles up in there? tasted a little like buttery wontons? not sure. but it was tasty, got it with chicken and that stuff was grilled to PERFECTION.']
["Upon perusing the Flat Patties reviews (heretofore known as 'Flatties'), it seems that the overwhelming feeling is that the burgers are underwhelming and greasy. \n\nI'll be honest. I have not had a burger here.\n\nWhat I have, every single time I come here, is the grilled chicken sandwich.Flatties serves up a whole breast of chicken, grilled with some spices (I imagine it is salt, pepper, and a bit of something else). Lettuce, tomato, and I add avacado. Fresh avacado. Yes, this is a 'fast food' joint. But they have avacado. YUM!\n\nTop it off with some of their condiments (fantastic relish! jalapenos! red onions! PICKLES - sliced thin! YUM!) They have an array. Since food is really just a vehicle for condiments, go forth and top your sandwich/burger/fries. Enjoy.\n\nYou can sit at the 'bar' (counter?) and watch the Flatties peeps cook your food fresh for you. I like knowing that my food hasn't been sitting waiting for me for a long time. The other thing, which I think is fantastic, is that they are constantly cleaning this place. There has not been one occasion I can think of where I did not see at least one person scrubbing, washing, or drying something off. OCD me loves cleanliness. You should too.\n\nFlatties is also cheap! They even raised their prices in the recent past (within the last year) but I think the sandwich (sans avacado) is still under four bucks. How can you beat that?"]
["My arteries still haven't forgiven me for trying to tackle that fried cheesecake on my own two years ago. I'm not going to pretend like the first few bites weren't ridiculously delicious, but the whole thing... ...anyway.\n\nFlat Patties is unapologetic, and you should be too. It knows what you want, and really the only thing stopping you two from having a good relationship is that you don't admit you want it. B Good down the street offers up pretty tasty healthy burgers, but something's missing, isn't it? IT'S CALLED GREASE. You need it in a burger. And Flat Patties delivers.\n\nConceptually, I'm occasionally repulsed by Flappies, but every time I get a burger there I walk away happy. Their fries are delicious, they have a good selection of pop (I'm from Ohio, and you can deal with it), and...um...the desserts...well...\n\n...I mean, FRIED CHEESECAKE."]
['Awesome food, and probably the best value in harvard square for a burger.']
["There are two ways to look at this place, one is to judge it based on the quality of the food (not so great), and the other is by the price (great for the area). Value is where these two factors merge and where individual taste emerges.\n\nFlat Patties is a fast food place in every sense of the word, and whether or not you like it is dependent on your tolerance (or love of) your standard fast food. In every way, Flat Patties is much better than your typical chain fast food place - but it is unabashedly still fast food. And foodies beware this is food for convenience and price nothing more.\n\nI personally have a very low tolerance for Fast Food and found myself significantly less enamored with Flat Patties than my companions who have taken me. The buttered brioche buns are a fabulous touch, but it is the greasy low-quality beef that fails to excite me, the cursory not-always-fresh toppings, and the unimpressively average fries that fails to impress. Sure it's better than Burger King, McDonald's, and Wendy's but not much more.\n\nFor the price, you'll struggle to find a better deal in Harvard Square.  Pinnocchio's is the only alternative that comes to mind (and is a better option, IMHO). Personally, I'll save up my bad karma from meat-eating for something a bit higher quality."]
["I had heard about this place from a couple different sources including the owner of the place talking about how great their roast beef sandwich was. So on a recent trip to the Square I stopped in the Garage and tried it. So I ordered the roast beef sandwich with sauce, cheese, mayo and a side of small fries. Now, this may sound xenophobic but the kid working the counter didn't understand a word I said, so I repeated it. Then, the manager type finally came over and explained it to him and asked me for my order...AGAIN. Which I gave AGAIN including fries. He then asked me if I wanted fries. My issue was his perturbed attitude considering a) I did nothing wrong and b) I was the only freakin person in line!!\n\nAt the end of the day the sandwich was good and the fries were very good but don't look for napkins beyond the ONE they give you with your meal"]
['Here are the notes of my review that I started several weeks ago and never bothered to finish.\n\nNo flavor\nCheeseburger with mushrooms and "special sauce" that was useless.\nFries were pleasantly salty but were mostly tiny niblets\nI\'d rather pay more and get better food.\nThe idea of fried banana cheesecake would be the only reason I\'d go back.']
['Got the pulled pork sandwich. I politely asked the cashier if I could get a pickle instead of coleslaw with it, and even offered to pay the difference. She rudely said "No." When I kind of looked at her questioningly, she asked "So you want the coleslaw on the side?" Um, I guess so! I know this is a cliche thing to say, but I have worked in customer service before and the standard way to say "no" to someone without making it a negative experience for the customer is to offer an alternative. She could have at least said "No, unfortunately we are unable to make substitutions." or even "No, but would you like to order a pickle as an additional side?" instead of just shooting me down. I was just kind of caught off-guard by her response.\n\nThe place is tiny, you can basically watch them make your food right behind the register as you wait. I watched the guy put a bowl of pulled pork in the microwave, and then plop it onto a bun and call my name. Gee, I\'m so glad I decided to leave my apartment and go to Flat Patties instead of just eating leftovers from my fridge! Not only that, but the plate he put it on was yellowed and greasy all over (even on the bottom) like it had just been marinating with a bunch of other dirty burger plates than actually been washed with soap. The sandwich itself was not impressive whatsoever, but hey it was only $4 and I hadn\'t eaten all day so it didn\'t seem completely revolting. \n\nI won\'t be eating at Flat Patties again.']
['Went for my first time on Saturday, craving burgers and was not dissapointed.  The line was fast and prices were great.  I Ordered four cheeseburgers, a fish sandwich, and large fries.  Cheeseburgers were awesome, very "In-N-Out" style especially with the \'animal style\' sauce.  Loved them and I\'ll get them again.  The fish sandwich was a little soggy and cold - will not get again.  I got a bad batch of fries - mine were the small, bottom of the bag fries.\nCheeseburgers were great, I\'ll be back for sure maybe once a month.']
["After multiple revisits, better insight ;)\n\nThis is a thin-patty-grilled-well style. Nice searing on the outside, resulting in a crunchy exterior that was concentrated in flavor and salt. The aioli toppings are a good addition, adding some creaminess and flavor. The bun falls apart a little in the end if you are having something with lots of liquid (eg. Forager, the liquid from the mushroom sauce).\n\nFries are not the best though. Weren't crunchy, didn't have much potato-ness. Too scrawny, too. Order a double slider rather than eating fries. Or order a shake.\n\nGreat non-cheffy burger place, much better than UBurger. It's my go-to, at this value it's way up there with Craigie, Radius, Eastern Standard, and Neptune Oyster burgers."]
['I love this place.\n\nI\'m somewhat of a burger snob and I still manage to find myself eating here about once a week.  There is a definitely dearth of "fast food" in Harvard Square, but I\'ve found that Flat Patties more than makes up for it by offering a great burger cheap and fast.\n\nThe burger patty is thin but juicy and there\'s just enough lettuce and tomato to give the burger a nice crunch.  The bun can be a little too fluffy if they\'re busy and don\'t toast it properly, but when it is toasted it makes a great burger even better.\n\nThe reason that I\'m giving it four stars instead of five is because the fries are more often than not dreadfully floppy and soggy.  While some people might like fries like this, I\'m a fan of crispy fries myself.']
["I was underwhelmed by Patties'. It's just fast food. If you don't like fast food, you won't like this.\nIs it cheap? Sure is. But a burger and fries around the corner at Charlie's Kitchen is cheaper. And better."]
['As a vegetarian, I have tried many, MANY veggie burgers.  But, Flat Patties has BY FAR the absolute best veggie burger I have ever had.  It was cooked perfectly, was so fresh, and the house sauce on top was perfect!']
["Gross. Flavorless beef. Soggy microwaved bun. Meager toppings that added nothing. A handful of French fry ends. All in all a disgusting experience. Not to mention the tables were dirty and it's a way too overcrowded fire hazard upstairs. I think Boston magazine said this is the best burger in Harvard square...don't really know what they were thinking unless it was a paid for by Flat Patties article."]
["I had the best cheeseburger of my life in here yesterday.  I had never been before and all i can think about is going back.  It's a tiny little hole in the wall place right in HS and there's seating for about 8 people downstairs where you order at the counter and then they call out your name.  There is also upstairs seating, i dont know for how many though.  My bf and i got a cheeseburger w/fries, a chicken sandwich w/fries and two sodas for $16 and some change.  I didn't want to leave.......If i thought i wouldnt have looked like a pig i would have gotten another cheeseburger."]
['I was heading out today and just before I left the house I saw a piece of a segment on The Phantom Gourmet and one of the places they spoke highly of was Flat Patties.  I was intrigued...  I should let you know that I am not much of a burger eater, it has been a while but I figured I would try this place to kick off the new year.  I was initially curious about trying the custard, but I didn\'t want to shock my system too much so I just tried the hamburger pattie.  I found the place really easy after I googled the address and saw that it is located on Brattle street.  It was such a nice day there was even a small table on the sidewalk with a few customers enjoying their late lunch.  As you walk in you quickly realize that it is a small place that has a loft seating area, but at the entrance you will find the menu board hanging that gives you options of either a single or double burger/cheeseburger adn a lot of garnishes.  Plus they also offer salads, sandwiches and a lot of side dishes like french fries and onion rings, etc...  I chose to order a single cheeseburger with avocado.  It only took about five to seven minutes for it to be served, and I was able to grab a stool in the window while I waited.  As I watched the flow and vibe of the people I noticed that even in the mid-afternoon there was a steady line of five or six people, plus there was little available seating.  My cheeseburger arrived and I didn\'t want to put anything on it the first time other than the avocado I ordered, but if you are looking for garnishes there is a garnish mini-bar by the door with a wide selection of sauces and garnishes, including the basics like ketchup and pickles.\n\nThe pattie was served on an oval plate, like in a cafeteria and at first glance it is big enough without being obscene and not so small i feel that I am not getting my value of the money spent; which was about $5.50.  The bun is soft with a slight crust so an improvement upon the standard grocery store burger buns, but not so much bun that you loose the burger.  The avocado I ordered appeared to be about half an average size placed on top.  I was very hungry since it had been seven hours since I had eaten but I tried to slow myself down.  It was a very juicy burger and the pattie was a medium-rare.  I also think that they put there own "special" sauce on top, too.  Overall, i was very pleased with the burger and glad that they didn\'t cook the burger too long, I enjoy a little pink in the center.  \n\nIf I lived near this place I might go back to try one of their sandwiches or possibly a salad simply to support a well run small business that appears to be making a good product.  I am intrigued to try their custard, but that my have to wait until it warms up, I am not someone who craves frozen treats in the middle of the winter.  I am sure that I will return in the future when I am passing through and will definitely tell family and friends who are living or passing through Cambridge/Harvard Square.']
['My husband loves this place. A lot. It is a fantastically greasy burger. I usually get the burger with blue cheese and bacon, and it is delicious. Their shakes and drinks are a disappointment though.']
["A co-worker of mine recommended this place and it was pretty good. My burger was well done (a definite plus from nasty effin UBurger) but the fries were ... over priced and tiny :(\n\nOverall I really enjoyed the meal but next time I go, I'll spend someone else's money on the fries so I don't feel ripped off."]
["Now that flat patties has caught on they have decided to jip you on the fries.  I ordered a side of fries and they gave me like 10 fries, not cool. Next time I want fries I will go to Charlie's.  The food is still good but the small portions are small. I will be exploring other options for nex time."]
["Great spot for a quick and inexpensive meal. The food wasn't anything spectacular, but was still tasty and did its job."]
["This place is everything a burger place should be: cheap, fast, and consistently delicious. \n\nIt should be noted that when I say cheap, I don't necessarily mean McDonald's cheap-- no dollar menu-- but $3.90 for a good cheeseburger is really reasonable, and I'd happily pay a lot more for a burger this satisfying. The meat is always meaty and flavorful, the bacon I get on top of my burger crispy and delicious, the toppings options are surprisingly comprehensive and reasonably priced, and, very best of all, they grill the buns in butter. In addition to the burgers, the fries and onion rings-- ESPECIALLY the onion rings-- are out of this world."]
["This once hidden gem has blossomed out to a full rock. I liked the location the garage better (being selfish here as no one knew about it), but now it is out in the open for all to see. \n\nThe food is still as great as it was, but as others have noted when it is busy, it can get frustrating.\n\nGo off hours and you won't be disappointed with my favorite burger (not made by me)."]
['Great burger, very good pulled pork, and the kids really enjoyed their grilled cheese. Six out of six enjoyed their meal. Fast and inexpensive also. If you like food then you should eat here.']
['5 stars just for being so cheap, fresh and quick (A meal in Harvard Square for under $5?!  Are you kidding??). And for the good service.\n\nI\'ve had the portabella mushroom sandwich, fries and frozen custard, and would recommend all three.  The fries are good (not "great"), but I love the portabella sandwich.  Just enough to make you full; cheap ($4.75); comes on a buttery bun, made fresh daily.  \n\nThe location is small, so seating is limited.']
['Fantastic food at great prices. New favorite in Harvard Sq.']
['Part of a series of best burger in boston. \n\nnot a huge burger, but very juicy and yummy fries...cheap\n\nthrow some jalapenos on for heat']
["Excellent and affordable burger joint in the Harvard Square area! I got the South of The Border Burger. The cilantro aioli really hit the spot! I asked for the Jalapeno relish on the side b/c of my stomach problems... I need to tone it down on the spicey-ness of food life! Seating upstairs, downstairs, and patio. Hustlin' and bustlin'!"]
['Definition of my perfect cold day meal : 1 Flat Patty cheeseburger with tomato, lettuce, special sauce squished between that buttery Brioche (like) bun, small fries, and a Harpoon Root Beer. \n\nDrool.']
['I was not impressed. We ate there because it was there, and a guy had walked by previously raving about the place talking about how the burgers were nice and juicy. He was almost drooling about it.\n\nAfter eating I realized the drool was just grease that was still left on his face from the burgers.\n\nThe burgers are greasy as hell, and I have had better chili cheese fries. I was unimpressed. The 2 stars goes only to the staff, because they seemed nice.\n\nDue to what I got, I felt it was overpriced.']
["I LOVE THIS PLACE! Disclaimer: I'm a vegetarian so I've never eaten the burgers, but I can tell you about some of the other delicious things on the menu. The veggie burger is very good, a big square patty with lots of veg in it, on a nice big crunchy bun. The caramelized onions are soooooooo good I would highly recommend paying the extra to put them on anything you eat. The best thing I've eaten here though, is the grilled cheese. Grilled cheese with caramelized onions... HEAVEN. The best comfort food I could ask for. I also love the fries, they are thin and crunchy and you get quite a hefty serving. Lastly, the frozen custard is delicious, so rich, and they have hot fudge (very rich and almost dark chocolatey) and toffee as toppings. Not to mention, the prices are great. If you're looking for a no-fuss fast and deliciously bad-for-you meal, Flat Patties is the perfect choice."]
["My friends and I were starving and walking by people eating their sandwiches hooked us immediately.  I have a weakness for pulled pork so there was no mulling over the menu for me. The pulled pork was juicy, smothered with bbq sauce and made me happy again (confession - I get a bit grumpy when I'm hungry, just a bit). At four bucks to get stuffed silly, it was a deal compared to the other places we checked out."]
['Warning: these are NOT "flat" burgers!\n\nUm, soggiest buns I\'ve ever had. The greasy slab of beef arrived on a spongy brownish blob that may or may not have formerly be known as "bun". Picking up the sloppy, dripping wet, greasy slimeball to eat was a messy chore, to say the least, but the french fries were real, and they were spectacular.\n\nI was expecting a true "flat patty", nice and thin and a little crispy around the edges. Not so. It was super fat and not-so-cooked around the edges.\n\nWith all the gourmet burger joints in Cambridge, you can definitely find yourself a better burger than this place. Plus, not to be rude, but it\'s very hard to communicate with the staff every time we go in. \n\nOh yeah, they charge for refills, too.']
["Flat Patties has done something recently that few establishments could pull off successfully: they have managed to change locations, upgrade their digs AND keep prices low. The fancy new exposed-brick, loft-like dining room is miles beyond their former cafeteria-style home, but is still operated with friendly and quick service. They've moved on up alright, but there's no mistaking the inherent value in the good foodand neighborhood feel of this second coming of Flat Patties."]
["One of my favorite burger places in Harvard. Cheap and very tasty burgers with some creative options. I always get the Sunday morning and it's SO good. They usually have an interesting burger special as well. The buns are buttered and toasted. The fries are hand-cut, some of the best I've had."]
['Easily the best burger in town. You can take that to the bank!\n\nMy rec: hamburger with relish and onion. Nothing else. Prepare to be blown away my friends.']
["I love to make Flat Patties my first stop for an evening in Harvard Square. The burgers are great and service is quick.  It's also economical - an interesting and delicious burger with coke and fries costs less than one drink at most of the nightspots in the area."]
['Good food at good prices. I appreciate the simplicity of their menu, but don\'t expect to be blown away by it. I had the veggie burger, my husband had the pulled pork and my son had the hotdog. We share two orders of french fries which were on the greasy side, but tasty.  The man taking orders was very friendly and let us buy a "to-go" cup of milk for my toddler son even though they don\'t have milk on the menu.  \n\nThe patio is a great spot on a nice day for people-watching in Harvard Square. Other than that the dining space is small and most seating is upstairs. I couldn\'t tell if they had an elevator or not so beware if you plan on going with a stroller as we did.']
["I actually walked into this place b/c I was looking for wi-fi and they had big spacious tables that were empty. They claimed there was connection, but you have to sit along the counter near the window to steal the internet from the street. It's spotty, but would work if you're the ONLY person using it there (Harvard Univ, btw, if you wanna try for yourself).\n\nSince it would be completely rude to sit and not be a paying patron (and it's hard for me to pass up the smell of something cooking), I decided to try out a Fish Sandwich. Meaty pieces of fried fish, with tartar sauce, and cole slaw to top it off, in a buttered bun... all for about 5 bucks! Pro was that it was a good portion, but con that it was lacking in flavor a bit. So, I asked for me tartar sauce. And then scoped out their condiments, and added a bit more relish and a pickle. I'm a real sucker for condiments, and  they had these marinated/pickled onions that were soooo good! They really need to make a Mexican version sandwich/entrée or something b/c that taste really made me crave some Mexican food. But, I'm going off topic...\n\nIt's not like a secret treasure of a place or anything, but I really like places that have good service where you can feel like a local, and that's how I felt at Flat Patties. The manager sat down at the counter himself to eat a late lunch, and it was nice to just chit-chat with him like I would in the South. I'll probably come by here again, if for nothing else, the familiarity and to try another sandwich to pair with those gosh darn onions! :)"]
["I understand that this is a west coast style, so I'm admittedly biased, being from the midwest. However, I wasn't expecting a big, juicy burger. I knew what I was getting into. With that in mind, here's what I thought:\n\nThe problem with quick-fired, thin quarter-pounders is that you have to have really flavorful beef, and this place doesn't. The grilled bun was great, the toppings were great, the texture of the burger was fantastic. And the onion rings! Shoestring but not haystack (still in nice circles), and absolutely delicious. But the burger itself was just nothing special.\n\nIf you've ever been to a Culver's in the midwest, you've had a better version of this burger. If they could just find better beef, i'd give it 5 stars."]
["Mm, no thanks.\n\nIt's great that I can watch you grill my cheeseburger on an actual grill. You got me all excited Flat Patties! But nah y'all. The onion rings were crispy but pretty bland. And my flat patty wasn't even cooked evenly. My burger was half well done and half medium. And oddly enough the OUTSIDE was medium. Does this makes sense? Nope. Another visit to this place doesn't make sense either.\n\nThe bun was mad tasty though. But it's not called Tasty Buns."]
['All the "haters" who gives this place one star have no clue!\n\nIt all started with a simple run from Concord, NH to Boston (Roxbury) to pick up a couple of props for a show a friend &amp; myself are working on. After this whole endevor, two things happened: we had plenty of time to kill &amp; we were hungary.  I had heard about Flat Patties when I did delibvers to a construction site down in Cambridge about a year ago. This latest "Boston Run" was my chance.\n\nMy friend liked the idea, so after hopping the Red Line to the Cambridge stop, \'Patties awaited us two blocks away. Both of us got the double cheeseburger w/ the works. They had just the right ammount of grease dripping off them bottom, and were flling without being heavy. Lunch for two of us was under $20 (a bargin in Boston by any measure!)\n\nI\'d go back in a heartbeat!']
['Cheese fries. My newest discovery, and yes, it\'s something as mundane as cheese fries. I knew my prediliction to eat anything that vaguely resembles a future heart attack was going to get me in even more trouble one of these days.\n\nOH LORD. The cheese fries. Fries, smothered in cheese. Dip them in mustard and you can come pretty close to a religious experience. And I\'m not talking one of those: "You\'ve sinned WAY too much! To the fiery pits of hell with you!\' scary dealios, I\'m talking "You\'ve been so good, Your-Name-Here. It\'s time you were rewarded. Here\'s your very own Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie/Johnny Depp copy. Go ahead. Run along! And remember- you\'re dead! No condoms necessary."\n\nThat sort of thing kind of happens when I eat Flat Pattie\'s cheese fries. Three stars because that\'s really the only thing off the menu I get (except for the fries of the non-cheese variety).']
["I personally love Flat Patties. I miss their burgers so much. They are incredibly greasy and served on a buttery bun, but they are immensely flavorful. They are super thin so they get amazing caramelization on both sides.\n\nThough I love the burgers, I will say that their fries are subpar. But after eating a cheeseburger there, I don't need or want fries to detract from the taste of the burger.\n\nAnd if you like coca-cola, they have an absolutely perfect soda fountain and bottles of Mexican coke."]
["Like dressing up a hooker in versace, flat patties is fast greasy food with a focus on presentation and quality.\n\nThe last time I went on a greasy burger binge, it was at Wendy's in central square. Pattie satiates like Wendy. As an added bonus, her customers don't smell.\n\nThe grease puddle on my plate tells me the meat is full of artery clogging goodness. The bun is fresh and buttered, but not as soft as I'd like for a melt in your mouth burger. Onion rings are thin and not overly battered. It's a winning combination.\n\nDon't raise your kids on it, but when you're feeling like you want to be bad, head to flat patties."]
["Best veggie burger I've ever had.  Melt in your mouth bread.  Spoke to the owner who says they make the bread fresh every day.  I also had the Asian salad which was generous and inexpensive- also very fresh.  Next time will try the fish, which I learned is fresh caught in the mornings.  Very high quality food served on real plates, with real silverware and real glasses.  Great experience."]
["Perhaps I am overly quick to hand out 5 stars but Flat Patties has been a breath of fresh air in my Harvard Square burrito induced delirium. What is with all of the sub-par burrito places??? However, I would even say that Flat Patties tastes significantly better than Mr. Bartley's, which puts out a darn good burger. There is something amazing about the unadulterated production of a fast-food type burger for around $3 that makes it tastes great! The closest I can compare this place to is In-N-Out burger from the west, including the fries, which I really like. \n\nI wouldn't make a special trip to Harvard Square for Flat Patties but I would certainly work it into the lunch time rotation. Yummm Cheese burger.....luckily Felipe's owns Flat Patties because I am transferring all of my business."]
['No nonsense comfort food at a very reasonable price. in Harvard Square that is tough to come by! I particularly like the chicken sandwich with avocado.  And the staff are very friendly.']
['They ground their own meat and it makes for a tasty burger.  \n\nDrawbacks: I felt sick afterwards.  Fries were not that strong.  \n\nAn option when you crave a burger and Bartley\'s is closed or you don\'t have time for Bartley\'s.  \n\nThat will be one "useful" vote, please.']
["I wish I could give it 2.5 stars instead of two.\n\nGood:\n-It's open late at night.\n-The buns taste somewhat buttery.\n-The possibility of fried banana cheesecake.\n\nEh:\n-The fries are really thin and crispy, but not in the good way like Elevation Burger's.\n-Food court ambiance.\n-The burger itself was just ok.  However, my burger radar was skewed by two factors:  my visit to Bartley's last night and my diet from earlier in the day (Nerds, Laffy Taffy, bagel with butter, pink grapefruit soda, nachos, and pasta).  The Bartley's visit made me more of a burger snob and the junk food overload made me not crave greasy burgers."]
['The burgers here are very juicy, tasty, and just plain addictive. Saw it on Phantom Gourmet and decided to try it, and surprisingly, I wasn\'t disappointed. This isn\'t your plain old run of the mill burger; there is a certain flavor that many burgers are lacking that is definitely present in the burgers here. Spicy isn\'t the right word but it seems as if they add some sort of spices and seasonings for flavor to their burgers.\n\nI\'ve eaten in here about 4 or 5 times. I usually get the double cheeseburger with bacon. The bacon is GREAT. Some places have horrible bacon on their bugers and that kinda ruins it, but this place has great bacon. Very tasty. The toppings are good too, but not really on par with fuddruckers in the sense of quantity or amount of choices, not to mention most toppings add significantly to your bill.\n\nTried their fried banana and caramel cheesecake once and was pleasantly surprised. I usually hate anything with banana but this was very good. How can you go wrong with fried cheesecake? Plus I think it was 2 or 3 bucks, which is *great.* \n\nThe fries are pretty good; they taste fresh and very vegetable-y rather than greasy. Like hand cut, not sure if they are though. The onion rings are similar... very onion-y and not a thick layer of breading. They\'re not your normal burger joint\'s onion rings; kinda different what I\'m used to and I wasn\'t sure if I liked them or not at first. In retrospect, they were pretty good but I\'d say fries over rings at this place. \n\nThat said, I haven\'t been able to try anything other than their burgers because their burgers are so addictive and good. Well priced, at around 4 to 6 dollars. Many places charger 9-11$ for a burger that isn\'t even as good. The one bad thing about this place is that extras are a little pricey but totally worth it in the long run.\n\nDefinitely worth a stop. Get a burger and you\'ll be happy, they\'re what made me give this burger joint a five out of five.\n\nUpdate: Went back to Flat Patties again a few more times. Let me say that the onion rings are actually quite awesome. I am really getting addicted to them. They have their own style so dont go in with expectations, but they are tasty and fresh and not over battered. If you like thick batter or greasy limp rings, these aren\'t your rings. \n\nLove being able to watch them cook my burger too. It\'s like dinner and entertainment for free and it just makes you want it that much more when you watch them throw it on the grill.\n\nThis is one of those places that after I ate there, I felt absolutely 100% satisfied and just genuinely happy. My advice: Double Cheeseburger with Bacon, Onions, Cheese, and either mustard/ketchup or BBQ depending on what you are in the mood for. Side of fries or onion rings too. You\'ll be full and just feel "fat and happy."']
['I had the South of the Border burger today and it was super delicious.  The prices seem pretty good and the place is pretty neat in side.\n\nI would recommend checking this place out if you are in the area.']
['Flat Patties is a great place to get a quick bite in Cambridge. \n\nThe menu is either burgers or salads. They have every type of burger option: hamburger, chicken, veggie, portobello mushroom, etc. So, I imagine it works well for those that are veggie. Everything is a la carte so you basically pay three to five dollars for the burger and bun. Then each topping is extra. This is either great or not so great depending on your burger eating style. I\'m guessing if you like a burger with a lot of toppings it isn\'t very economical. However, if you have a few things you like on your burger then my guess is you pay less for a decent burger here. \n\nIn addition to the burgers, they have mondo servings of fries and a bunch of deserts. I had a chicken sandwich with cheese and avocado and shared fries with a friend. The food was very satisfactory. This type of food isn\'t my usual go-to meal so I\'m not a frequent customer, but if it was it is a good enough value that it would go into my "quick and cheap meal" rotation. \n\n\nIt has a nice spot in the arcade that is a bit blocked off from the main food court area. This makes it more pleasant to sit down for lunch and have a conversation without yelling.']
["I haven't tried much on the menu.... the chicken tenders leave quite a bit to be desired... \n\n\nHOWEVER... the fries are soooo good, and I seriously crave the fish sandwich at least once a week!"]
["The veggie burger with carmelized onions and cheddar cheese  is tasty, cheap and you don't have to wait for it. You can sit in a window and look out at the square, while you munch on your fries and burger. It's usually not crowded, who knows why, and there is a restroom. This is one of my main go-to options when I'm hungry in the square."]
["Sometimes you just really want a good cheeseburger burger. And fries. And maybe a milkshake. But if don't want to eat 8 tons of food from Mr. Bartley's so then head to Flat Patties! Relatively inexpensive, made to order, and totally hits the spot."]
['Great burgers and a great price. I think. I will give them that coveted 5th star after eating there a few times.']
["If this burger joint didn't exist, where would I be?\n\nI go here at least once a week. My co-workers started getting take out from here and after our breakroom smelling scrumptous for several weeks, I finally got up off my ass and went there. \n\nTheir cheeseburgers are ON POINT. The bun is buttered, toasted and fresh, the cheddar cheese tasty, and I don't ever ask for my burger to be cooked in any particular manner (medium, well-done,etc.) because they always cook it just right. I don't get it. It always comes out perfect. Effortless really. The cheese fries are smothered great sometimes, other times there's barely any cheese. I guess it depends on the cook.\n\nIt would appear to have ample seating, but not exactly. Sometimes two people sit at a four person table and waste the seating for everyone else....which I find annoying. So I mostly bring my food back to work and eat it in the comfort of my own breakroom. That and so no one has to gag at watching me try to catch the dripping house sauce with my tongue hahaha.\n\nMy friends have ordered other things too that they've enjoyed and I haven't tried yet, but I will soon. So if you love burgers, try this place before anywhere else. Heavenly."]
["I have thoroughly been impressed with Flat Patties since I went here about a year ago.  I am a particular fan of the Sunday Morning, where the tomato paste mixes perfectly with the over easy egg in lieu of ketchup.  These burgers beat Charley's (despite Charley's larger amount and still great quality burger) and are decently priced.  $20 will get you and your friend or girlfriend a nice, casual, and quick meal with satisfying taste.  The French fries are also done with just enough cooking time to give them a nice crisp feel and not completely coated in grease.\n\nAnother big plus here is the selling of Boylan's Grape Soda.  Top notch."]
['Only been there once, but liked it enough to give it 5 stars! I had the South of the border (has avocado) and side of coleslaw = $7.22 The burger was just enough size and had just enough grease to make me happy. Definitely will be going back there again!']
['Tasty burgers, but the service is sketch. Swapped orders, incorrect orders, and why is my "large" order of chili-cheese fries SMALLER than my companion\'s "small" order of cheese fries?\n\nAnd beware, the chili they put on the fries is heavy on the hot sauce. If you, like me, aren\'t particularly a fan of hot sauce, this might ruin an otherwise good order of fries. (Note too the inconsistency between visits: one order tasted "normal" while on my next visit I might as well have chugged a bottle of Frank\'s Red Hot.)\n\nThree stars, but barely.']
['I ordered double cheese burger with sauteed mushrooms and onions. I enjoyed looking at it before I start ruining it! The amount of cheese was so appealing to me. After that first bite, it was this pure shot of cheddar and juicy patties and mushrooms blended together. I liked the way they cook it juicy and tender! My friend ordered fries with melted cheese and it was ok!']
["Damn!  Flat Patties is one of the best burgers I've had in a long time.  Fast food that is not crap...an amazing concept.  \n\nIt's a small, almost burger stand rather than a full restaurant, but don't let than turn you off.  Very good service and the food came out quickly.  We tried a single burger, a double burger, the mozzarella sticks, fries and hot wings.  Everything was top notch.  I can't wait to go back again!"]
["A good choice if you don't really know what you want and you only have $5. The burgers are cheap...the chicken sandwich is good too. For some reason I tend to go out on limb here and order the obviously bad choices like the portobello sandwich and fish and chips. I, too, dislike the fact that you have to pay for refills. The service sucks, cashiers hardly ever look you in the eye and the guys who call your name always get it wrong, leaving customers to work it out amongst themselves.\n \nPluses- the buns are great, I guess they make them there. The owner is really friendly, eager to share info. about the ingredients and such."]
["$3.20 for a floppy cheeseburger? McDonald's does them for one third of that price - so is Flat Patties' cheeseburger 3 times better? No. Maybe only twice as good, and twice as good as a McDonald's cheeseburger is NOT a compliment.\n\nI appreciate the sentiment of trying to run an 'alternative' burger fast food joint but bland buns, thin low quality patties and not much else is not going to win you any fans. This is way way behind Kenmore Sq's U Burger. And it's in a food court too - never a good sign."]
["I went to flat patties on my way home from work today. There were 3 people in the restaurant and I needed to catch my bus in about 20 minutes. After waiting for the cashier to get off a personal phone call for 2 minutes I order a single cheeseburger to go. Simple, right? The next 20 minutes ensue with a level of poor service I have never experienced. The cashier/cook both gave up after messing up the order before mine 3 times because they couldn't understand the English. This took 15 minutes to settle. Next, a man ordered 2 burgers with ketchup, mayo, and mustard 2 orders before me. This took 20 minutes to figure out and the manager had to come make these two simple burgers. My burger had been ready for 15 minutes but no one bothered to package it up for me and when I got it, it was cold. The burger tasted worse than a burger from Wendy's. Horrific service, average food. Do not attempt."]
["This place truly exceeded my expectations!  Appearance and location wise (the grungy Garage), you'd think the place is a dump at first glance.  But pick up a burger and you'll be salivating before you even bite into it!  It's a thick pattie on a delicious brioche bread.  The melted cheese on the burger completely surpasses other cheeseburgers that only have sliced cheese slapped on.  You can tell that care was put into the concoction of your meal.  \n\nThe chicken salad that I got the second visit wasn't half bad either.  It's a good portion of lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, and onions, but there isn't enough chicken.  Also, I wish they had a larger variety of dressings.  I was forced to get ranch instead of my favorite, honey mustard.\n\nI should have expected excellence after finding out that the place is also owned by the guy that owns Felipe's Tacqueria, but it took a visit to truly find out what I've been missing out on!  Forget Mr. Bartley's famous burgers, I think for the price you pay, this place beats the competition!"]
["You know what's great about this place?  The price!  You start out at a very cheap price for a burger and it's most definitely worth it.  For someone who likes their burgers relatively plain, this is a good place to save money and still get a solid meal.  Great bread.  Pulled pork sandwich is solid too!\n\nDownsides:  Fries are average...Food overall is a bit greasy."]
["Just grabbed a cheeseburger from there for lunch and I must say I was pretty impressed. Would definitely go there again to try out the other stuff on the menu -- especially the fries since i have heard pretty good reviews. \n\nI think what was really amazing about the burger was the bun. For some reason, the bread tasted REALLY good, and it was soft. I am not a big fan of bread (hence hamburgers) but really liked this one. The sauce (mayo with some other stuff) was really good too and was what really made the burger taste different. I guess it's either you hate or love the sauce since some ppl wouldnt like mayo on their burgers. \n\nAnd please dont compare it with Macdonalds. $3 for a made to order burger is pretty good deal in my world!"]
['Oh my.\n\nFlat patties should be called Crap patties.\n\n I am not one of those people that refuse to eat at a "fast food" joint.\n\nThis place is an exception. NEVER again.\n\nSorry, but the floppy burger, salty fries, mushy buns and food court location totally allows Crap Patties to live up to every preconceived notion about fast food operations.\n\nIt was so horrible, I was forced to go home and cut short my blissful day at Harvard Square.\n\nAnything that prevents me from going to Lush is blacklisted FOREVER']
['My son and I got take out back when this place was in the Garage. We loved it, but we live on the South Shore and when I tried to check their hours I found it was closed. I was glad to see that they reopened and last weekend my daughter and I went there for a late dinner and walk around the Square. I had a regular hamburger and she had a Forager, both were excellent, juicy and flavorful. The fries and onion rings were very good but the burgers were the stars of the meal. I try to avoid milk shakes but they were out of root beer so we both had a chocolate shake. It was worth the extra calories, the shakes are awesome, thick and chocolaty.']
["Am I allowed to review this place, when I don't even eat hamburgers? (My last was three years and four days ago.) Sure, why not? Today I tried their portabello sandwich. Not bad. Granted, it's a pretty simple product, so they can't damage or improve it too easily...a big mushroom, lettuce, tomato, and some kind of sauce on a bun. A fine lunch--not hearty, but enough, and not bad for $4.00. Next time I'll have to try the grilled chicken sandwich, which is only $3.00.\n\nIt's a decent enough space to eat, especially on a rainy day when you don't want to see what it's like outside (it's inside the Garage, away from any windows). Though the location brings back wonderful memories that almost prejudice me against Flat Patties. The previous tenant in this location was Formaggio, makers of the best sandwiches in Harvard Square, if not the world. Flat Patties can't live up to its legacy, but it seems like an okay place for lunch."]
['Juicy, meaty burgers! The perfect place to grab some food before a movie at the Brattle. The "blue burger" (bacon, bleu cheese, BBQ sauce) was outstanding. The burgers aren\'t massive but they are damn good. Onion rings aren\'t bad either. Good food, great service, low prices. Highly recommended.']
["I've had the chicken sandwich here twice. It is very good for the price ($3 with no additions). With cheese and sauteed mushrooms and onions, it is very satisfying. (Unlike another reviewer, I like the grilled buns.) The fries are a bit tastier than average. One of the better quick, cheap lunches in Harvard Square.\n\nUpdate: ut oh, my last bun lacked some grill flavor"]
["This place is neat! A small place in Harvard that I think is fairly new . My hubby and I happened upon it on a date and went in to check it out. I'm glad we did! The smell inside is amazing and you can see them make their fries right there. Burgers are made fresh and are delicious. This is not a pace to visit if you are on a diet though!"]
["They were good, but not great. I've gotten a much better burger at Fuddrucker's. The service was rushed, and the fries were not as hot as I would've liked them to be. The burger was also greasy. It was cooked well and to my liking, but any time I see my bun soaked with grease, I get turned off. \n\nThe wait was also unbearably long. I thought a burger only took a few minutes to cook? I had to wait like 10 minutes. Boooo!"]
['Like In and Out Burger came to Cambridge. Flavorful burgers that were a little messy to eat, but very tasty. (Plus, $4.25 for lunch in the Square? Yes please!)  Loved the frozen custard and the Cokes (the good kind that are made with real sugar and come in glass bottles), though rather hilarious that the Cokes cost almost as much as the burgers. Super nice counter service. Definitely worthy of their win as best affordable burger in Boston.']
["I am pleased that this local joint moved so well into its new digs. While it seems to take its model from being the kid who moved close to the very popular Creama Cafe, and has the same exposed brick etc., there is a good chance that they will emerge quite well. I didn't dig them in their old digs (it was too chainy-like)  but I like this place enough to consider it for take out once in great-long while, though b.good still rules."]
["I am surprised at the ratings of this place. Although I've been only once and did not care much for the service (it's somewhat difficult to order in spanish, since i am asian)\n\nBUT: for the californian who misses in-n-out, this place is for you. Stick with a cheeseburger and fries, but the fish sandwich looks moderately awesome as well. BUT YEAH, THIS BURGER IS AS CLOSE AS IVE GOTTEN TO INNOUT, and I've been looking\n\nKetchup is the devil's condiment. That's why it's red. Don't kill your burger with it"]
["We stopped at Flat Patties on a whim...  Prices were decent.. There is a small seating area.  I'd say it would be better for a grab and go kinda place if you are in the Harvard Square area.  Buns were pretty mushy.\nMinus 2 stars... I ordered the fried apple pie and I took one bite and inside of it was something that looked like orange cheese... so that was immediately put into the trash."]
["Fast food is not difficult, you need a good food and to serve it fast. But the sad thing is that Flat patties doesn't offer that at all. The place is not that big and there is a lot of thing going on there and you can't really relax and enjoy your food. I wouldn't say that the staff is unprofessional, but the services need to be faster. I can get over that the 20minutes wait, but I can't get over those fries, I can make them better. Seriously, a lot of people complain about them and I fell sorry that I need to write about them too. No so bad place, but because there are so much better places with fast services and fantastic food I cant give it more that two stars."]
['I found Flat Patties to be really good and effecient. Their menu is simple and clean; burgers, fries, desert along with a few stand out things like their pulled pork sandwich which I thought was very good. Their buns feel buttery which is also nice and their fries feel a lot more natural then the ones you find in most places. As far as their drinks go, they offer a similar selection that one you could find at Boca Grande with the classic, big name sodas along with the Jarritos Mexican flavored soda. Cheap, quick and good is key!']
["This little hole in the wall burger joint is awesome.  Don't go here if you want healthy food because everything on a bun is drenched in buttery goodness, but if your in the mood for a hotdog or a burger you'll definitely enjoy yourself."]
["Ehhh... Not so good. Burgers are made to order, but are done on a Wendy's/Mcdonalds type flat element, not an actual grill, the prices aren't very cheap (when compared to say, Spike's), and I dunno, I just never really feel satisfied after eating here.\n\nThe service is pretty lousy, they can't call your name at all, and they'll forget things like lettuce and tomato sometimes.\n\nThe fries are meeh as well.\n\nHonestly if I had never heard of Spike's, I would've rate it higher. But they've ruined me!"]
["I gave up on Flat Patties.  They serve OK food at an OK price, but there are simply better places to go in Harvard Square for a burger.  Like so many others have said, their fries are mediocre and super-salty, and their counter service is certainly 2nd rate.  I am willing to try them again, but if you're visiting the area there are simply dozens of better choices within a 1000 foot radius that reasonably match their price point."]
["First thing you should know is that everything here is fresh and made to order. The fries were really good but the burger disappointed me a lot. I ordered the burger with mushrooms+swiss (forgot what it was called) and I didn't enjoy it at all. The meat tasted really bad and its quite obvious that their meat isn't very high quality. The horse radish sauce that was on my burger was disgusting. Honestly I would never visit this place again unless I wanted their fries."]
["Give me Flat Patties over Mr. Bartley's any day of the week/year/decade/century. Oh man, I love me some Flat Patties. Tasty, cheap burgers w/ lettuce and tomato on a grilled bun with cheese... and what the heck is that fantastic special sauce?! \n\nI will actually go out of my way and even scramble during lunch breaks to get from the Financial District to Harvard Square and back in order to satisfy my F.P. cravings. F.P. and Houston's are seriously my fav burger joints in the immediate Boston area.  (I still have to try the F.P. desserts!)"]
["I've been here twice now in the last month and it's been really tasty both times. The burgers are spot on and the fries are solid - free jalapenos is a nice touch at the condiment station. They're buried behind sidewalk construction at the moment, but it's a much better location than the Garage. I'll be back when the burger craving kicks in!"]
['My friends and I practically live in The Garage and came across Flat Patties a couple of years ago. Since then, we\'ve enjoyed countless numbers of burgers with the usual toppings and their delicious "special sauce" with fries, crisp chicken tenders/wings and  fresh salads. Their portions are more than fair for how they\'re priced.']
["The only thing that stops me from giving Flat Patties a 5 is that it's located in that awkward urban mini-mall called The Garage.  So I'm excited to hear that it's moving to a new location at Brattle Square.\n\nThis is my favorite burger in Cambridge, although you have to prefer the classic fast food style evoked in the place's name. Everything is made fresh so the grease is still hot, and options abound: I recommend piling a side order of coleslaw onto a double cheeseburger with bacon, although the recent addition of avocado to the menu might have changed my standby.  I don't know if it's the buns, the patties, or the special sauce that makes the burger, but together it's just right.\n\nI'm not a big fry guy, so I won't offer my judgment there."]
['Kind of hit-or-miss burger place in Harvard Square\'s famous "garage" mall. The first time I went, the burger was just okay, and I was happy it was so cheap. The second time I went, the cheeseburger just tasted kind of bad. The brilliant brainchild that I am, I ate most of it anyway. Predictably, the greasy mess made me feel kind of sick, which is generally what happens when one forces themselves to eat something that tastes kind of bad. OK, so I take some responsibility in this. I haven\'t been able to will myself back there since the bad cheeseburger day, but I could see myself giving it another go at some point.']
["Flat Patties is great.  You can get in and out quickly, the hamburgers are full of greasy goodness, lacking pretension (unlike many other restaurants in Harvard Square) and the Garage is a fun place to be.\n\nThe other menu items are great---pulled pork and chicken tenders.  There is something for everyone a Flat Patties.\n\nIf I were given the choice of fast food (McDonald's, Wendy's or Burger King) and Flat Patties, there would be no competition.  I would be the first through Flat Patties' door."]
["If you're happening to be in Harvard Square you definitely need to check out this place.  I always seem to order the same thing grilled chicken sandwich and I finally switched it up and order pork pulled... it was good but i definitely love their grilled chicken better.  The price is definitely affordable."]
["The first time I visited, I was looking forward to the hamburger they were about to make me. After all, they had a nice variety of condiments, and I chose some unique ones myself, to make it an experience. But when I got the finished product, I was taken aback slightly. Now I'm from California, and I'm not sure if it's a New England sort of thing but the sandwich was dripping in grease! It practically made the bun tear apart on its own. The taste was okay, but the fact that I was biting into juice made me focus on the negatives of eating a hamburger. To make things worse, the meat was not cooked thoroughly (they did not ask me whether I wanted it rare, medium, etc.) I had a feeling they didn't put enough care into making my burger, like it was just another order they needed to get out of the way. Forget that! Never going back."]
['Nothing too special. Just plain burgers and fries, you get what you pay for...']
["Really good, really cheap grilled cheese sandwiches. Possibly the best in Harvard Square, although Leo's puts up a mean g.c.s. too.\nThe roast beef sandwich is also very good, served on a buttered, toasted bun, the way all roast beef sandwiches should be."]
["Hit this place up on a weekday night for some simple grub. It delivers. I love hamburgers and Flat Patties is a place I'd visit again. Got the cheeseburger; my wife got the bacon cheeseburger. The buttered buns are a nice touch. We also got the onion rings. There are other dining options beyond the hamburger as well, but you get the idea.\nAs you can see, we were looking to eat healthy. All jokes aside, the food tasted great, and the service was fine (it's fast food, after all).\nThe only drawback is the parking's a pain, but it is Harvard Square after all."]
["Flat Patties is my fave for a cheap meal in the black hole of mediocrity that is Harvard Square.  I've been up and down the menu and a burger and fries or pulled pork and fries is hard to beat.  They are also generous with the avocado and the french fries are fresh cut."]
['The only good part about the meal was the onion rings, &amp; there were barely any on the plate.  I also ordered a fish sandwich which was mostly cole slaw, the tiny piece of fish on the sandwich was greasy &amp; inedible.']
["Just went for the first time tonight, not bad, not bad at all. Good burger, amazing fries. What it lacks in atmosphere (it's in the Garage) it makes up in good prices and good burgers.\n\nI'll be back."]
['My daughter and I are vacationing in Boston. The first day we found FP. The fish sandwich and veggie burger are excellent. We have been back for more. The price is very reasonable. They also have outside tables.']
["Great fast food burgers cooked on the griddle. Rich tasting buns. Salty fries. Special sauce. I wish I lived closer so that I could eat here all the time. Except then I'd be much fatter. So maybe it's good to have these burgers only once in a while as a special treat (usually after going out drinking, curiously enough).\n\nI can has cheezburger?\nYes, yes you can.\nThat is all."]
["i fear 'special' sauce.  put the name 'special' or 'secret' in front of something at this price range, and i will probably avoid it.  that said, my burger with bacon was very tasty, even without the sauce.  the fries were great, but the portion size was bad for a large - it made me wonder if they'd just forgotten to upsize it from the normal.  i'd rather cart myself out to wild willy's, but this was fine for what it was."]
["I think they beat all the lunch prices in Garage Building at Harvard Square. It is not really a restaurant but a take out type.Unlike a reviewer below, I find this place far better than McDonald's or even Wendy's. They are home-made patties.\n\nWhen I unwrapped my chicken sandwich with extra onions and mushroom, I also thought the meat was very thin, but look at the bun size, it was bigger than my hand. so it is about the right size for a hungry rugby player*w*.\n\nI find the combination of caramelized onions and juicy mushroom extras helped the flavor of my sandwich a lot and I recommend you guys to think of rich flavor instead of a simple burger of buns and a plain patty. We ordered chili nacho on the side-chili was a bit too sweet but the 3 cheese almost perfected its taste.\n\nWill I go there again? definitely. And, I was amazed how the fast food can be served in the old-fashioned way and tastes. And, you will be surprised how cheap the menus are. You probably have to pay double to get that grilly taste."]
['One of the cheaper deals for a meal in Cambridge. Good burgers with nice toppings. And root beer floats = automatic 4 stars. I love Flat Patties!']
['Went yesterday-- first and only time; I\'m an out -of-stater. A hamburger so disgusting I could only eat around the edge. Borderline raw, though I ordered medium. Roll SOAKED in grease. "Special" sauce not-so-special. Did not eat for the rest of the day, and have spent my morning vomiting.\n\nNot only do I NOT recommend, I warn.']
["One of my few top-shelf burger joints.  It's been a while since I went to Bartley's, but I recall being unimpressed by the hype.  Flat Patties lives up to it, though.  Their special sauce (Thousand Islands + something else) kills me every time.  You will not find a better burger for $3.90 in Harvard."]
['Very good burgers and interesting toppings (I had the Forager which I recommend), good fries, good frozen custard. Not quite enough seating but still a good choice for a quick bite in Harvard Square. Prices were reasonable.']
["This is probably the only food substance that looks the same before liposuction as it does after liposuction.\n\nSloppy, greasy, tasteless, lifeless.\nThe onion rings were of the ilk of bad carnival stand onion rings - wimpy, a little cool, floppy.\n\nMade me feel a little sick afterward, not because it was tainted in any way, but because of the guilt I felt afterward. Like the feeling one would get after punching a kitten, I'm guessing."]
["When the cashier handed me back my credit card it was covered in grease. When your first impression is of grease you know you have stumbled upon a certain type of establishment. Prices are ok, at least by Harvard Square standards. You still don't get a lot of food and what you do get is saturated in grease. Even at the low prices the food doesn't seem worth it. The pulled pork sandwich was only ok, have certainly had better and bigger. The fries were overdone and dripping wet with grease. Soda selection is lacking as well. Coke Zero in bottles or glass bottles of traditional Coca-Cola. Total rip off trying to force the customer to pay more for the glass bottle while trying to go for a vintage vibe.  With so many other good options in the area I don't see the point in this place thriving."]
["The burger and fries combo is perfect for students. It's an exquisite combination of grease, special mystery sauce, and, oh yeah, there was some meat and potatoes in there, too. It's affordable and probably won't kill you. I have eaten all my Flat Patties takeout with enthusiasm."]
['Yuck.  Nasty, greasy burgers and fries..']
['A friend and I sought out Flat Patties after reading the Boston.com article that listed them as having the best burger in Boston.  I don\'t know if I would go so far as to say the "BEST" but it was pretty darned good.  Flat-style (duh) flavorful burger, not too huge of a bun, delicious sauce (not super strong flavor wise but added something to the mix), plus I got cheese, grilled onions, and bacon (I know, I know how to live).  Friend got a double cheeseburger with grilled onions and mushrooms and loved it too, we split a large order of the salty shoe string fries and had drinks - all for under $16.  Good deal, delicious burgers.']
['My friend and I came here for a quick and easy dinner date to catch up on the latest gossip in a relatively relaxed setting.  We each ordered a burger and then finished the meal with fried banana caramel cheesecake.  The burgers were fine, not super filling but nothing to write home about.  The cheesecake was delicious but I knew how gross it seemed on the health scale so I felt guilty with every bite I took.  The service was fine and the prices were pretty low, but not one of my favorite places to eat.']
['Love this place! Delicious burgers in a sophisticated atmosphere.  No beer or wine but a clean, scrumptious alternative for a great burger in the Square.  The staff is also super friendly.']
['Very good food, comes quickly, but there\'s always difficulty finding seating. great "fast food" type burgers--though more expensive than something like five guys. their french friends are delicious, too.']
["I felt waves of abdominal cramps and nausea within 45 minutes of eating a hamburger from this place, and I felt sick for the next 36 hours.  I hadn't had anything else to eat that day besides a regular breakfast of toast.  It seemed like a classic case of food poisoning to me, so I will never eat there again or recommend it to anyone."]
["Flat Patties serves up a delicious, simple burger at a reasonable price. The best part of the burger is that it's served on a brioche bun. There's a small toppings bar where you can add your pickles, onions, relish, etc., and the burger itself came with tomato and lettuce. I also enjoyed the chili cheese fries, which you should definitely eat with a fork unless you want grease splattered all over your shirt for the rest of the day. However, I can't for the life of me figure out how a grilled cheese sandwich can cost the same as an order of chili cheese fries. Don't get the grilled cheese. It's boring, perhaps a little too simple."]
["quick awesome cheeseburger for less than $4. i love it!\n\nif i am having a super huge burger craving i want the big papi burger (chipotle sauce, cheddar, guac, tomato  jalepenos) found at uburger in kenmore.\n\nbut  for a quick, simple, delicious and slightly unique burger on a huge delicious brioche bun, flat patties is perfect.\n\nthe fries are thin and tasty too.\n\ni regretfully neglect this place because it's tucked away in the corner of the garage, but it's a treat to eat here every time."]
["I love this place. Great burgers and fries. Love sitting at the counter. Food is always hot and fresh. Only had the burgers and nothing else. Portions are just right or you can order a double if you're feeling hungry."]
['I love this place. The cole slaw is good, the fries are good, the burgers are good, and the grilled cheese is amazing. I know it might seem a little weird to sing the praises of a grilled cheese sandwich, but I happen to think that making a good grilled cheese sandwich is a little bit like making a good pizza: anyone can do it, but hardly anyone can do it well. And the folks at Flat Patties can do it well. They grill both sides of the bread and fully melt the cheese, sending any grilled cheese aficionado to crunchy, gooey grilled cheese heaven.']
['so delicious.  reminds me of steak n shake back home, but better.\n\nwould highly recommend the onion rings and burgers with special sauce.\n\nan excellent place that is currently open till 12 on weekends, but could be open till 2 if more people came!!!']
['Cheap eats! Fast and demi polite! I enjoy the flat patty with cheese as it is cheap but eatable.  The tomatos and iceberb are a bit iffy but the "special sauce" is pretty good. $4.10 can\'t be beat! I do need to try the fry selection!']
['blah, blah, blah, burger, burger,burger.  I know "Patties" is in the name, but the best thing here is the chicken Ceasar salad.  The chicken has a nice marinade and is cooked on the grill to order. Nothing like those cold chix chunks you get everywhere. Nice croutons. The dressing is made in-house, lemony and they toss with fresh cheese.  Forget that dressing-on-the side thing here, girls.  You will want all of it, so give it up and feel virtuous that you are not having a greasy burger.']
["Yum! Cheap, greasy burgers and fries, served fast and with a minimum of fuss. This place is several steps up from fast food in terms of taste, almost as fast and only slightly more expensive. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it."]
["I went for the fist time today after seeing the place on the Phantom Gourmet.  The food was very good and affordabe.  I wanted to write a review to mention that their food-handling practices are bound to make people sick.  I wasn't surprised to read another reviewer had gotten ill.  \n\nThe cook reaches into a raw meat bin and grabs a patty to grill, and, without changing gloves, proceeds to handle the cooking tools (spatula) and do final assembly of the burger (putting cheese on and handling the roll).  This is unacceptable in a modern restaurant.\n\nIf you like old fashioned burgers, along witht he food-borne illness, i highly recommend this place."]
["I find this place a bit funny because I applied for a job here, worked a good shift, and wasn't hired in favor of a drop-dead gorgeous Slavic immigrant who could barely use the register or speak English. That being said, I love their fries. :)"]
["I like Flat Patties. On a hot summer day in Harvard Square it's nice to pop into the garage and get a seat at the bar and people watch while eating a cheap, and just right grilled cheese. If they had a substantial smoothie selection I'd have went four stars here. As it is, I have to wait in an additional line at Ben and Jerry's for that. \n\nNo real complaints, just no real fireworks. Go for a nice, quick fill-up sop you can get back to enjoying your day fast, not for a nice chill, super-enjoyable lunch."]
["Food was good - burger cooked medium &amp; great flavor. Prices good except for drink refils that they charge $.50. Upstairs seating was empty but every table hadn't been wiped down so bring your table sanitizer with you. Staff was fast &amp; very friendly."]
['i cant imagine that placehow people like there food they cant cook a hot dog if there life depended on it hey cant speak english when they ask you somthing you dont put a hotdog in a micowave oven and then put it on  a grill afterwards that really made me mad i am a consumer and if i pay 2,75 for a hotdog i want it on a grill']
["I love Flat Patties every time I go!! The food is made to order and tastes great. I love the buttery bun, the special sauce and though the patty isn't that big, I don't like big mounds of meat, so I think it's the perfect size, and if you want more just order a double. Both the onion rings and fries are tasty though I prefer the onion rings. The place is really clean. I sat there today reading a book and watched them clean up as soon as customers left. Almost my favorite part of the whole place is the great music they play: latino, dance, even Michael Jackson's Beat It made the mix today. Makes me want to dance while I'm eating. I wish they had free refills though, I can never get enough, refills are 50 cents."]
['The way a few of my friends talked about Flat Patties I expected the best burger in town, but it wasn\'t exactly that. I defiantly liked this place and would go again for a burger and fries. The burger was tasty and I thought the combination of ketchup, mayo, and mustard was interesting and I was excited about trying this new "mixture" on my burger (I am usually a Ketchup girl) My boyfriend insisted on getting cheesy fries...they were good, but I would much rather have had the yummy shoe string french fries minus the soggy cheese. This place is great to go for a quick bite to eat and I would go back. Although I do want to try UBurger too!!']
['Flat Patties is my favorite burger place in the Boston area. Cheap AND delicious. They are very greasy, but that makes it better... for me, anyway.']
["Yum! This burger is the closest to In-N-Out that I've gotten outside of the West Coast. Flavorful, juicy, and a nice, tasty bun. I had the South of the Border style with the jalepeno relish, jack cheese and avocado, but I think a plain cheeseburger would have been just as delicious. This will definitely do to satisfy my West Coast burger cravings!"]
['The perfect fast food burger.   Sure it was a little greasy, and the patties were nothing huge, but this is near the peak of food court dining.  Really tasty stuff. Decent fries, and some really good artery clogging burgers served quick.']
["Best burger joint in the area as far as I'm concerned.  At under $4 for a simple hamburger that is better than most $10 burgers at restaurants near by, it is perfect.  The toppings, available on a side bar, are house made and phenomenal. The pickles and pickled jalapenos and onions add huge dimension to an already delicious and juicy burger.  This is not a sit down place but perfect for a quick, and delicious bite!"]
['Flat Patties has a solid burger! The day we went there I had a tummy ache so I may not have enjoyed my burger as much as I would have otherwise, but I think it\'s a solid three stars overall. Not the best burger I\'ve ever tasted, and it was still kind of red in the middle which was a little bit scary (I\'m sure that\'s fine, but ya never know). It was my first time in Harvard Square, and I think if I were to go again I\'d probably eat somewhere else just because it didn\'t leave a huge "OMG This is the best burger evaarrrr" impression on me. But it was good. The staff was friendly and the place was neatly kept and had a fun food court but not a typical food court atmosphere.']
["This would be five stars, but with the move they've changed their buns (as far as I can tell that's the only thing that's different about their burgers). The old ones weren't too memorable but were good enough. The new ones are quite chewy, and while they're not necessarily bad, while you gnaw at it your super-sloppy burger (as Flat Patties burgers inevitably are) kind of disintegrates. Mine ended up turning into a beefy, pulpy mess--but hey, it still tasted good, so four stars."]
["I was heading through the Garage today, and I ended up stopping at Flat Patty. I had never been there before, so I was up to experiencing a new place in the city.\n   I wasn't very hungry, but I'm always up for something new, and burgers are often delicious, so what the hell. \n   I ended up getting a double cheeseburger, chili fries and a coke. A strong meal, if I do say so myself. I wasn't expecting perfection, but being a place that basically sold burgers, I did expecta little more.\n   Now, there was nothing wrong with it, exactly. In fact, it was quite good, but it wasn't great. The beef was a little on the bland side and it defiantly needed more cheese. I opted to get it without lettuce, tomato or sauce (which was probably just mayo &amp; ketchup), so meat and cheese was all I was looking for. If they only tossed some salt &amp; pepper and maybe a little spice and it would have been a quality burger.\n  However, on to the Chili Cheese Fries. All I have to say is, good for them. The fries are cut thin, topped with shredded cheese and chili. Two excellent points about the fries. One: No beans in the chili. Beans are filler and they don't make up for lack of meat. Second: The toss hot sauce on top. Such a simple dish, but together it makes a little bit of love. \n   In the end, I'd say get a burger, ask for extra cheese and absolutely get a dish of chili cheese fries and a coke. It's a nice, filling stop that is at a really great price.\nGo for it."]
["It's located in a sort of food court near Harvard Square.  These burgers are pretty good.  These definitely taste more like you would make at home, fresh lettuce and tomatoes and a burger with a little taste.  It was pretty greasy though and the fries were especially so.  The fries were good though- shoe string fries with skins left on.  It was pretty cheap too.  Still I would rank Wendy's (not the one in Central Sq!!) a little higher.  Just to note what my hamburger scale is here: White Castle=2, McDonald's=4, Burger King=5.5, Wendy's=6, Cheesecake Factory et al.=6, InNOut=7, Fatburger=7, Dairy Queen=7, Max and Erma's=8... out of 10.  Flat Patties would be a 5.9."]
["We meet at Flat Patties, located in The Garage in Harvard Square.This is much more of a fast food environment than anything, there's less than ten tables with a few scattered counter seats throughout. Even though it rests in such a high traffic area, its pretty clean, in fact, on this particular visit, The Garage is pretty clean in general. The first thing that grabs my attention, however, is the simplicity of the menu, and I don't mean that in a bad way. We can only be prejudiced by our own preferences, and for me, a burger is all about simplicity. In my last post I criticized The Biltmore for not pulling all of its culinary promises off, when in reality, had they, they could have had a much higher score, maybe an unbeatable one. I still don't know what my perfect burger will taste like, but for now, the West-Coast style, which is what Flat Patties serves up, seems to be more my style. I ordered a double cheeseburger, that came with lettuce, tomato, cheese and a house sauce, as well as a small order of onion rings. The food came in about 8 minutes, and they also have a self-serve topping bar at the counter. I have a love/hate feeling towards this, while I appreciate the offer, I want my burger to be prepared and topped for me, I understand that some people may want jalapenos or relish, but not me, please serve it to they way you intend for me to eat it. Upon first bite, I knew I loved it, the grilled brioche style bun was lovely, it had a nice crust and was a perfect fit with the meat, just the right amount of bread to meat ratio. And it was juicy, very juicy, unfortunately I couldn't taste the house sauce at all but I honestly didn't miss it too much. The beef was good, not great, could have been seasoned better and certainly not the quality of a John Dewar. The onion rings were solid, a bit greasy, but perfectly salty and delicious, if not a little on the skimpy side. ($2.25 for about ten very thin rings) I tasted a few fries, which were sub-par, somehow cold, even though they claim to fry to order, but there's no way fries get that cold that fast. A few things were curious to me though; 50 cent refills on the soda machine, a gumball machine from the late 80's and a gigantic tortilla press on the counter even though I couldn't detect a tortilla-like product on the menu whatsoever. Overall, the burgers were great, it ran in at about $11 per person, the service was fast and friendly and I left completely satisfied, I will definitely return."]
['I love flat patties. It reminds me of In-N-Out. The menu is simple and so are the burgers. Simple and delicious and cheap. Everything I want in a burger joint.']
["Haven't had anything but the cheeseburger and fries, but I'm definitely a fan.  The one unfortunate thing is that the burgers are occasionally quite greasy, but good days make up for this, IMO.  The fries, in particular, are fantastic - small, light, hot, and delicious enough to eat without any salt or ketchup.  As clean, affordable meals in Harvard Square get rarer and rarer, I find myself coming here quite often.  Only the occasional unpleasant burger prevents me from giving it five stars."]
['wow. the sauce totally makes it, and the prices are phenomenal ($3.20 for a cheeseburger). fries are thin, crispy, though with lots of visible oil that the bf sponged off. minus a point for "fresh lemonade" that most definitely was not, and that was served in a glass so full of ice that it afforded about five sips before it was all gone. the burgers, though, will keep us coming back.']
["strangely tasty - slim patties, freshly grilled &amp; dressed in yummy grilled soft white bun with crispy lettuce &amp; decent tomato... even my picky 3 y.o. eats them - generally he refuses all fast food.  so, based on that alone, i'd give it a thumbs up."]
["excellent burgers - i am a big fan of the bbq blue.  don't forget to try the custard.  get a scoop of both vanilla and chocolate - you will not be disappointed!!"]
["I stayed away from this place for a long time since I'm not a huge burger eater but I finally stopped and looked at the menu and decided they had enough of a variety that I should try it.  And it's so cheap I figured it wouldn't kill me even if I hated it.  I now get their chicken sandwiches all the time.  The buns are very different, I can't describe it, and very delicious.  Not a huge amount of chicken but I think it's a perfect portion size.  And there's some sauce on it (again, don't really know what it is) that is very tasty.  Normally I prefer my chicken sandwiches fried but this is grilled and really good!  It tastes very fresh.  I'm so happy I found what seems to be a relatively healthy place to eat on the cheap in Harvard Square."]
